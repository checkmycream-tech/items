            <li>Very good cream</li>

            <li>Really good quality cream!  </li>
            <li>I never thought that my skin would look THIS GOOD from a spot corrector!</li>
            <li>none of them worked even remotely as good as Vernal!</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, my skin is glowingly beautiful.</li>
            <li>I take religiously good care of my skin as a consultant, but am very fair and acne prone with some blotchiness.</li>
            <li>This is a great over the counter product, though.</li>
            <li>great for lightning spots.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I know 49 bucks seems steep, but you can&#x27;t put a price on feeling great about yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li>A great plus is that it didn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really happy about that.</li>
            <li>but it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I am happy about my purchase and I will continue to use it faithfully.</li>
            <li>well it worked great for me.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was of great quality too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great dosnt leave a sticky greasy residue on you face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to do so since I&#x27;m  getting great results.  </li>
            <li>I will spread the word to anyone in need of a great  product like this.</li>

            <li>Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>With time, this product has produced some amazing results!</li>
            <li>When I decided to try this product I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the best results because it would need more time than 2</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look.</li>
            <li>Very happy and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this 2x a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look.</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve used for more youthful skin, including a prescription product from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>it gives good results after continued usage.i ordered this product in exchange of reviews</li>
            <li>but this did a good job.</li>
            <li>Now I can just use spot concealer for work to even out a bit and am good to go.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s realy good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a sign of a good result of my face.</li>
            <li>I waited to review this item so I could get a good feel</li>
            <li>I believe that the results fom the Vernal spot corrector are just as good, one just has to be patient.</li>
            <li>Cream is good on skin but had no effect.</li>
            <li>I bought this because had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good Luck to you all.</li>
            <li>I have not used it,expecting a good effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is in fairy good condition.</li>
            <li>This cream isn&#x27;t magically perfect, it doesn&#x27;t work quickly</li>
            <li>Very  pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>For someone with oily/combination skin, it applies nicely and feels good and breathable on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is noticeably more even and my complexion looks very bright and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be getting more when this runs out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Naysayers, use a sunscreen, it won&#x27;t get rid of freckles you are born with, and give it more than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more ecstatic!  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t almost $50 a bottle because I sure need another bottle!</li>
            <li>I tried this product when it first came out and was impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Many compliments came my way after a two weeks of using the wonder cream!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re sure to see an improvement!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>This product is truly magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this corrector!</li>
            <li>I love how this product made my skin feel!</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>It does go on smoothly and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The seller is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed It really helps to perfect blemished skin, and reduce the redness.</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast and arrived perfectly.</li>
            <li>apply a nice, even coat.</li>
            <li>This product is effective and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>this nice since I was 35.</li>
            <li>I have a light-med skin but the fair (no 1 ) works better on me .</li>
            <li>I think the price justify a hydrating and effective spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Also using retional and vitamin c products for which this is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>I have really seen an awesome difference in my skin since the beginning.</li>
            <li>The product is okay but not as good as another</li>
            <li>It gets warm on your face.  </li>
            <li>I scrutinized my own face, and yes, I had them too.</li>
            <li>my honest opinion for a promotional price</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the money!</li>
            <li>The serum is light weight and pleasant in odor.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has caused some breaking out for me, but I break out very easily.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and I am thrilled with the results with Vernal.  </li>
            <li>and he said he liked this one better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to almost eliminate moisturizing (which is good for me, as after trying multiple moisturizers, even the ones that worked best seemed to increase breakouts.)</li>
            <li>This cream is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>This was one of the top rated, effective, and affordable.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far..</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks more clear and beautiful!</li>
            <li>The main reason that I splurged on it was because of all the brilliant reviews about how it works wonders on lightening acne scars.</li>
            <li>It balances the fine line between effective but not wreaking your skin to achieve results.</li>
            <li>The results have been very good so far.</li>
            <li>It works so well with my skin and absorbs fully which is a HUGE PLUS!</li>
            <li>I love Vernal products so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I will see more of an improvement on the spot situation.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love the fact that the cream pumps out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on.</li>
            <li>I would love to get it more often if it weren&#x27;t so dang pricey.</li>
            <li>I received a weeks worth of samples from my friend and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li>this is it, one more.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve used was hydroquinin 4%, but I can only use it for 2 months before having to switch.</li>
            <li>I tended to get flakiness and dryness with most acne product.  </li>
            <li>The pump packaging is much more sanitary.</li>
            <li>Do make sure you wear sunscreen</li>
            <li>and it gives a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>What I love about this cream is that after a week of use you can see the difference.</li>
            <li>It is just ok.</li>
            <li>With this price I would expect to see more result.</li>
            <li>I do see that more of the reviews are &amp;#34;verified&amp;#34; which I hope means they are authentic.  </li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>For best results to those who say it doesn&#x27;t work for you have to wear SPF sunscreen or you&#x27;re defeating the purpose of it and your spots will come back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy some more and see where it goes.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>and the results get better and better.</li>
            <li>its ok... meaning from  this moment</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love using it.</li>
            <li>It works well, and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s in my top five favorite anti aging products.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>My sun/age spots have faded and my skin looks brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now; a couple of days ago I was looking in the mirror and realized that my acne scars are really much better and some are non-existent.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I got this stuff through I love to review.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for many months for a product to lighten the hyperpigmentation in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it gives a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is lovely to use as well--light and creamy.</li>
            <li>For the price, the pump should be made better.</li>
            <li>I will be watching my credit card statement just to be sure</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>but my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, my complexion is brighter, and face smoother.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and tone is more even.</li>
            <li>My face was well hydrated and felt so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product morning and evening around my cheek area and most of my forehead.</li>
            <li>My Maybeline Matte Mousse was enough to give me a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>and the spot on my face is diminishing :-)</li>
            <li>Pleased with the service.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to use it some more months.</li>
            <li>It works too so the makeup must be ok.</li>
            <li>I felt that the vitamin C serum I used was better.</li>
            <li>In just two weeks, my sun-damaged skin looked better.</li>
            <li>I do not think this product is useful and effective to my skin problem, so basically I kind regret that I chose to buy it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that with continuous use the spots will fade.</li>
            <li>I am making sure to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use it morning/evening every day, so make sure you keep up with the routine</li>
            <li>I would for sure repurchase :)</li>
            <li>I could notice more of a difference with the sun block.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable wearing no makeup around the house with my roommates, and am close to going out on the town with zero foundation!</li>
            <li>It took more than 1/2 bottle before I saw the result.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, it clears up more.</li>
            <li>More to come</li>
            <li>I have some sun spots on my cheeks that tend to reappear as I get more sun in the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li>and now I have more spots than I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Vernel N-E spot corrector to get rid of some &amp;#34;liver&amp;#34; spots on the top of both hands.</li>
            <li>I prefer to resort to cosmetic better than wasting Clinics amount of and without access to a satisfactory outcome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to stick with it.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried this product out.</li>
            <li>You would have to buy many bottles and use for awhile.</li>
            <li>Love this cream</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for more noticeable changes.</li>
            <li>Better yet, my skin tone seems much more even, my skin feels great andI have not broken out once since using this this product.</li>
            <li>Vernal worked better than City Lights.</li>
            <li>As children, we were encouraged to stay out all day and get the &#x60;healthy sunlight&#x27; and a tan.</li>
            <li>fast shipping - great product</li>
            <li>Perhaps by then I will be able to tell whether it worked on my Melasma condition or not.</li>
            <li>Love love love it..</li>
            <li>I use another Vernal product in the day and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great company.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I was using Clinique before switching to Vernal spot corrector and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied that I ordered another bottle to continue the fading process.  </li>
            <li>Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see how this item works.</li>
            <li>and I can say my acne scars have gone faded significantly!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>This product is light, fragrance free and feels nice on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I am in my mid-40&#x27;s, olive complexion, oily skin prone to breakouts, and increasingly dryer skin and fine lines around my eyes needing more TLC.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference, most of my scars are faded and I have a clearer skin tone.</li>
            <li>So far, it is working great.  </li>
            <li>I have even seen my face become more acne free.</li>
            <li>No irritation which is great since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the results and will continue to use it on my hands and face.</li>
            <li>, I am happy with the texture and appearance of my 60+ year old skin since using this product.</li>
            <li>spots are becoming a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>I also loved the packaging which I thought was very chic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes things more fun :)</li>
            <li>always great when you are able to get double amount of product!  </li>
            <li>I also have acne scars since I scar fairly easily.</li>
            <li>This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li>I have problems with hyperpigmentation and this clears it up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li>Works great at first with consistent exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I like this cream because it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Took about 2 weeks of using it twice a day to see a strong improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>and I believe that my amazing results are in part due to that along with this just being a great product.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever tried for my dark spots...</li>
            <li>Fades dark spot wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
            <li>I also love the way this product has brightened up and evened out my skin tone, and when I put it on it makes my face feel super</li>
            <li>The product really lightens the dark spots and best of all, gives the skin a nice, supple appearance.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, absorbs quickly, and really made my skin look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>The Proactiv Spot Corrector didn&#x27;t have immediate or much noticeable results, but this has been working very good so far.</li>
            <li>My acne worsened  and as a result, I had very dark acne spots all over my face that even the best concealer couldn&#x27;t conceal.</li>
            <li>I need to wait longer before I can give an accurate review.  </li>
            <li>works great on the skin, I saw a big difference in months.</li>
            <li>I received the product free in return for my review.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin blemish free and ultra smooth.</li>
            <li>product itself feels light and creamy.</li>
            <li>Smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my skin, and it&#x27;s most definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>But really, this serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on like silk and leaves your skin soo smooth.</li>
            <li>Now when I apply light foundation to my face you can&#x27;t see some of the sun spots I used to have on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Is light and airy on skin.</li>
            <li>rather it&#x27;s a light cream</li>
            <li>After using the whole bottle I decided to review and give honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I could tell instantly how great it is.  </li>
            <li>Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li>Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample, and I am usually really harsh about my sample reviews so that customers are informed, and I want to say this product works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, and because of it&#x27;s price at $49.95 I really wasn&#x27;t sure...</li>
            <li>I feel that the money is very worth</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin that has acne scars and after using it exactly as directed, my skin tone is looking more even</li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh non oily looking on my face and gives me a beautiful glow instantly.</li>
            <li>Patience is well worth it with this cream!</li>
            <li>Patience with this cream is worth it!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet and I am already seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is perfect and there is none of the coffee house aroma I associate with skin lightening products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost because I am seeing results!</li>
            <li>Patience is well worth it with this cream!</li>
            <li>This product was so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Its totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for just over a month and have already seen some results of my scars lightening significantly from what they used to look like.</li>
            <li>That said, everyone is unique and therefore what works for me may not for you.</li>
            <li>It goes onto the skin without tugging and is easily absorbed - and - for me - works!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two months since my original purchase</li>
            <li>take advantage of this product I  purchased after reading most of the review of customers where I am impressed by what is said about ,  and what I suffer from a remote spot in my face time in the cheeks area took me enthusiasm to buy this magical product that I&#x27;m  looking for from long time. .</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and was willing to go for something that promised good results.  </li>
            <li>It has a light and dries fairly quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>My face and neck was now clear of the sunspots, which made the sunspots on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; even more prominent.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and much cheaper than some of the other options and works just as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they sell a large size.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many spot corrector products and none seem to make that much of a difference</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to try something different and it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I would and have recommended this product to several friends, family and co-workers who all loved it as well.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it dries and is not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been able to step out of the house make-up free, and i love it.</li>
            <li>Will update when used longer to review true darkspot correction claim.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve still yet to see full results with this.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t expect full results yet anyway</li>
            <li>I will keep you posted if I see the full results I am after.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>I waited until I used my full bottle before leaving a review.</li>
            <li>I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it smells kinda &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and kinda flowerish, but scent disappears after application and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>great fragrance, not bleachy like other spot correctors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reduced the appearance of most of blemishes I&#x27;ve had and my skin complexion is starting to look more radiant and even.</li>
            <li>Since I just started using, I can&#x27;t provide an adequate review for awhile.</li>
            <li>overall complexion is much  more even, and holds onto moisture much better as a result of it&#x27;s healthier state.  </li>
            <li>Given more time, I hope that this product will resolve most of the issues I have with the discoloration as I have noticed some change, but it has been only a week.</li>
            <li>I use it for redness and scarring on my face and it has helped lighten it tremendously.</li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed to see these kinds of results so quickly.</li>
            <li>I did not expect for this product to work so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the proactive pads help boost the effectiveness of the product and why I&#x27;m  seeing results so quickly.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>As a mild acid would feel.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, and has helped to clear up my acne scarring fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin and not greasy like so many other creams/oils &amp; lotions.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report after a week of use the dark spots on my face are beginning to fade</li>
            <li>I normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for most products I buy.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>I. Have been using this product for a week now, my skin feel better, but I will give it a little more try before I can fully comments on it, so far so good</li>
            <li>But I love the way my skin feels and looks so much from this cream that I would actually purchase again for use as a really incredible daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Though this product seems perfect and has great reviews , I was hesitant because of some of the poor reviews by other users.</li>
            <li>One needs to be more patient, when using new products.</li>
            <li>But my skin looks great, and in another few months - I think I may have lightened these spots to the point of not having to use full coverage makeup at all times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best skin care product I have tried to treat dark spots and discoloration</li>
            <li>:) Oh, I also have very sensitive skin and have had no problem with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this spot corrector for only 2 WEEKS - and I already love it!</li>
            <li>This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>but my bareface complexion is now almost as good as I could previously get with light bb cream coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to go for something like Intense Pulse Light</li>
            <li>I have not used the product yet, but it did ship fast and free from damage.</li>
            <li>I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing</li>
            <li>I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are simple effective, natural ingredients including licorice root which is said to help with hyper pigmentation/dark spots.  </li>
            <li>My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li>It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>is gonna be worth the money or not.</li>
            <li>: I really needed more time to review this, but the website I&#x27;m suppose to write this review for wants it now.</li>
            <li>It is pricey for my taste; however, well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is better than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried and believe me when I say I have spent more money on products that do not work.</li>
            <li>Its worth it if you have the income.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt it is worth the money</li>
            <li>In exchange for this product this is an honest and personal review.</li>
            <li>This cream is a nice consistency but that is it&#x27;s only quality.</li>
            <li>So far i love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li>After the whole 3 months people were actually commenting on how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I like this product I can feel my eyes fresh and smithing</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Mostly from old acne scarring.</li>
            <li>something year old skin is just more stubborn about releasing the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>My natural complexion is a lot more even now.</li>
            <li>Mostly from old acne scarring.</li>
            <li>My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li>My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li>It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s going to be worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely post review when amazon ask me to.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>--I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and the troublesome spots that have been on my face for awhile now have begun to fade; I imagine if I actually stuck to the regimen properly (once in morning and night), it would work better, but sometimes I forget so it has worked good for someone like myself who is pretty forgetful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any significant results.</li>
            <li>then the ones on my right.</li>
            <li>All the spots on my right hand are practically invisible.</li>
            <li>This stuff right here is</li>
            <li>The visible improvement is a confirmation that we have made the right purchase.</li>
            <li>I slide it on right after showering and it is creamy enough to serve as a pretty nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so happy that I will never have to waste money trying out spot correctors again because this one is an absolute keeper!</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle and yet effective dark spot corrector!</li>
            <li>Nothing SUPER magical happened but after almost 1 month of using this every day, my skin is smoother, clearer, and my acne scars are definitely lightened.</li>
            <li>As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this Vernal N-E Dark spot corrector cream in the mail!!!!</li>
            <li>I have finished the first bottle of this cream and see a distinct fading of brown spots.  </li>
            <li>The lotion was fine on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A light-weighted, silky smooth, and fragrance free facial cream.</li>
            <li>Also, as a HUGE bonus I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne has cleared up considerably!</li>
            <li>My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li>My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 4 days of use and I already notice a difference in my skin, will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the cream would do well because it&#x27;s very light, but it turns out that has allowed it to actually stay on my face because it blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave an after-film or oily residue that would make me want to wipe it off.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to see too much change within the first month, however I am blown away!</li>
            <li>I have used many high end dark spot corrector products ,but this one acts better and faster than all others on the market.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>However, you have to be consistent, and applied it twice a day.</li>
            <li>is it makes my skin very oily!  </li>
            <li>Bottle is pretty, but its too soon to tell if it works.</li>
            <li>The cream had turned a blue-purple color on my leg which at first startled me thinking I had hit my leg and then realized it is the product that can be wiped off.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, this is my second Order.</li>
            <li>I have had this just a short time but noticed a lovely glowing skin feel and appearance.</li>
            <li>First of all, this has done wonders for my skin texture and helping with skin turnover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pricey beauty product person, but I&#x27;m impressed enough with the results that I&#x27;ve bought a second bottle while still only part way through the first one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the bottle I received was defective because I had to break it open to get any out.</li>
            <li>old with light complexion and tried this product for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin looked more clear than it normally does.</li>
            <li>It is a sigh of relief especially since I&#x27;ve bought many products that claim to fade sun spots</li>
            <li>really, really does fade sun spots!</li>
            <li>and I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I&#x27;ll come back for a better review.</li>
            <li>This is my first serum corrector that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If you stick to it, you&#x27;ll really see results!</li>
            <li>I used every bit of this product exactly as directed and got zero results.  </li>
            <li>From the first squirt, the pump dislocated and did not work.  </li>
            <li>I asked for a sample of this first since it is pricey, but after using it for just one week which is what the sample size lasted for, I went in and bought the full-size product.</li>
            <li>Will most likely have to buy another bottle soon.  </li>
            <li>I was assured that I&#x27;d receive another bottle at no charge, and sure enough I did.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift at first for my mother.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 weeks now and 80% of my acne scars have faded.</li>
            <li>Love it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>so my first application</li>
            <li>I will be back for more</li>
            <li>I am confident enough after trying this to buy the whole line!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>My spots look lighter and my skin has an overall more even appearance.</li>
            <li>Funny on the packaging</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize but not enough for my skin which needs more hydration.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked at all the ingredients and studied each and every one but some of the first ingredients</li>
            <li>After years in the sun I have a definite &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; along my cheekbones and up by my temples, and even the most concentrated spot has lightened already.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products over the years</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d try this product first.</li>
            <li>It was funny looking and embarrassing to wear.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!)</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!)</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable and received right away.</li>
            <li>At the very least, it made a good toner!</li>
            <li>It gets the 3 stars because it does make my skin feel different, in a positive way, as if it&#x27;s retaining moisture better.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much more even now, and the dark spots are significantly fading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many many many reviews, and it seems to me that you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and sinks into the skin quickly and is not greasy in the slightest way!</li>
            <li>This product is nice on the skin, light and soft and did wonders on clearing my skin of sun spots and also brighten some dark spots I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>But wow I was so excited to start using it when it came in my mail and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used other products skin lightening cream that have not been as effective</li>
            <li>Ordering was quick &amp; easy ... received order quickly, but the product is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product and will continue to use to combat dark spots!!! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not yet ready to go completely coverup-foundation free for work for example</li>
            <li>I tried a few products before trying out the Vernal NE spot corrector and to my surprised this product worked out great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much younger - fresh appearance, minimized pores, smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>A lot of the positive reviews in here are not &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li>This product feels very nice on my face, absorbs fast and not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li>This is amazing for my dark spots which were caused by the sun.</li>
            <li>I already seen very visible and very comparable results!</li>
            <li>First of all - I can&#x27;t really review this for age/brown spot removal as that is not my issue.  </li>
            <li>In other words, my skin does not have bleached or white patches where the age spots have been erased or greatly minimized.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed by how fast I&#x27;ve started to see real results (about 3 weeks) and can&#x27;t wait to see them at 6 weeks!</li>
            <li>It is a nice day moisturizer under makeup, but dark sport corrector???</li>
            <li>This is a staple of my morning routine, I easily look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream at a great discount in hopes that this was the last product that I would have to purchase since I have tried everything to no avail.  </li>
            <li>Why would my honest review be hidden.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after a period of great skin distress in order to even out the dark spots which were left over.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with dark spots around my eyes and cheeks my entire life, and this product has been great for me.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a smaller, travel tube that I could carry in my purse easily, though.</li>
            <li>I have three large age spots on my face.</li>
            <li>It comes in a heft large bottle for the amount of cream inside (1 fl oz).</li>
            <li>It certainly hasn&#x27;t disappeared, but there is noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>It protects against future age spot development with a balanced composition of stabilized vitamin C, &amp; Zinc PCA.This Vernal N-E Dark Spot corrector cream helps brighten &amp; even out skin tone and promotes long-term radiance revealing a more radiant glow!!</li>
            <li>I guess I bought it with very high expectations.</li>
            <li>and I did not saw any results whatsoever I had very high expectations for that.</li>
            <li>I will say what I mainly noticed is that treating the spots as they appear has a higher success rate than treating those that are a couple of years old.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and living in Hawaii is hard for me to not go in the sun</li>
            <li>This is amazing I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to experience the radical improvement that others did, but I did and I can definitely tell there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li>They are not gone but so much lighter.</li>
            <li>I really like how the cream makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I really like how it just smooths out everything on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>my skin is much brighter and even skin tone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot</li>
            <li>I think the collagen booster and this work really well together.</li>
            <li>and i havent noticed much</li>
            <li>too much time involved for</li>
            <li>I have tried product after product to reduce the blemishes on my face and neck, and have not had much luck.</li>
            <li>I used the item for 2 weeks, but it says you need 4 to see real</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second this is truly gentle.  </li>
            <li>fast forward to February of this year.</li>
            <li>expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>I think that it really depends on the type of marks you seek to reduce.</li>
            <li>I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to cause a gentle peeling.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to assess, but I do love the cool, moisturizing feel.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.</li>
            <li>So I was not expecting much when I tried this out.</li>
            <li>have light skin with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>and I can all ready see results.</li>
            <li>I have 2 very visible brown age spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my redness after 2 weeks of applying this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - April 9th - Customer service from seller is great and I immediately received a phone call regarding the broken pump.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing to fade or disappear freckles, age spots or anything on the skin.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for her</li>
            <li>I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a couple months and  really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in skin clarity.  </li>
            <li>Yep, it really does just what they say.</li>
            <li>Today as I got ready to step out, I  did not wear any concealer.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t really say that this product performs as advertised, maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  </li>
            <li>Did not see much difference</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen much difference except in the softness of my skin</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend and, after using for about a month, she really likes it for her face.</li>
            <li>I hear it is really satisfactory.</li>
            <li>But looks promising.</li>
            <li>This product did almost nothing for me after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>in skin tone, much smoother and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that has worked so fast.</li>
            <li>Is it reasonable to buy a month this amount with the payment of shipping charges and how much of the jar can be consumed to get the result lethal ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear that much foundation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Over the course of the month I really started noticing my acne scars had started to lighten up a lot.</li>
            <li>Not seeing much changed at this point...</li>
            <li>I expected more visible result but nothing at all.</li>
            <li>It feels very silky on the skin, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free/promotional item and it has done very well.</li>
            <li>it really work</li>
            <li>I use approx one pump and rub it over my entire face twice a day, and I feel that there is more evenness to my skin and some of the old acne marks that I had towards my jaw area have grown fainter and some disappeared.</li>
            <li>but the overall appearance of my skin is rejuvenated and much more clear, even from acne or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but a pretty good effect for less cost and hassle than a medical office treatment.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see how large the bottle is; it will last a good long while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some fading of my dark spots and will continue using twice a day in hopes of seeing more positive results.</li>
            <li>After having thyroid cancer and my hormones out of whack, I began developing this horrid large brown spots on my face - the most troublesome was the dark spots that looked like a mustache.</li>
            <li>I have noticed better results with this product in a shorter period of time than other products.</li>
            <li>I find I need to use more of this than some other reviewers to get results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing amazing results, but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for about 20 days now and the dark spots are really fading and my skin tone got much better over all.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a month and have noticed that my dark spots appear a bit lighter which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>What an amazing little product!</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t seen significant dark spot reduction yet, but my skin feels SO soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is very nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The blotchy areas are fading and I&#x27;m making sure I use sunscreen daily in my foundation to avoid making my hyper pigmentation worse and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it.</li>
            <li>Have been using for about a year - has lighted up a few very dark spots - best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li>The corrector cream helped with many of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>In my teenage years, sunblock was introduced to the public, and it was a greasy white zinc oxide that fair complexioned children wore on their noses.</li>
            <li>After a summer full of sun this totally recorrects any sun spots I may have!</li>
            <li>It has little scent, so doesn&#x27;t clash with any other scents one might be wearing, and is very silky and not greasy, so it leaves a very nice surface for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>When I get half way thru the bottle, I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The spots appear to have faded slightly, but I am almost thru one container and would have thought I would have seen a more substantial change.  </li>
            <li>The ones on my left had were darker and more numerous</li>
            <li>Thank you for helping a slightly older woman like what she sees in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a money back guarantee thingy because this would go back for sure.</li>
            <li>and I see tremendous improvements in sun spots/ age spots around the back of my hands, shoulders and cheeks.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin is EXTREMELY smooth and my overall skin tone is lighter.</li>
            <li>While I used it all over my face, I had a circle of brown spots which was my main test site.  </li>
            <li>cap was hard at first to remove for me and I ended up yanking the whole top off</li>
            <li>The product itself absorb into my skin quickly and the 2oz bottle really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for brighter skin.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this produce</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>Will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I had been using the product from City Lights for greater than 6 months with no significant nor lightening effects.</li>
            <li>Comedones are much reduced, almost completely eliminated.  </li>
            <li>They were old very superficial.</li>
            <li>Good, but too small, it only lasts one week.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in things like this normally.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better quality for this price but it was waste of money.</li>
            <li>My skin complexion has also improved, it&#x27;s now more even and balanced with few discolored blotchy areas.</li>
            <li>The spots were darkest and most noticeable on my chin, but I have a few freckles across my nose that I was hoping would fade a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely like it and am definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was not so expensive, as I need to now maintain this regiment, but as long as it works so well, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product was worth beyond the price because it ACTUALLY DELIVERS RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for only A FEW DAYS - and I already love it!</li>
            <li>but this product really worked, I had two very large dark/age spots (size of a dime) on my face that got even darker due to going to Hawaii and being out in the sun so much.</li>
            <li>The second bottle was less effective even with the same regimen I used with the first.  </li>
            <li>I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience.</li>
            <li>I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience.</li>
            <li>Put in a request to Vernal for a new pump</li>
            <li>I will place  review when i get my new bottle.</li>
            <li>I stop using the medication the dermatologist prescribed and order the new proactive.</li>
            <li>were not all new.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading yet but will continue using the cream till it&#x27;s empty and will write more later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell the results but he has high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this goes on like a dream.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li>The dark spots are so light and my skin tone has evened out.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I find is worth the money and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll start seeing results within the week if you use it religiously ;)</li>
            <li>I have for the last month been dabbing it on my 10-12 facial brown spots with twice a day (still on original bottle).</li>
            <li>Plus many other comparable products are only 1 oz</li>
            <li>I had recently got my first sun spot</li>
            <li>I have tried many other things and this actually seems to work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect Vernal to vanish my blemishes overnight, but they are fading quickly so far!</li>
            <li>It really is solid product, I will be buying it again once I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product in January it was my first time using anything from vernal and with the mixed reviews</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products, but this one has helped me out the most. .</li>
            <li>I tried many creams in the past: Clinique, Estee Lauder, Shiseido, MD-7, vita-K, and bunch of others.  </li>
            <li>I have about 1/4 of the first bottle left.  </li>
            <li>The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away.</li>
            <li>The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away.</li>
            <li>I have been an active person all of my life - spending much of my time outside in the summer, which has resulted in additional fine lines and sun spots.  </li>
            <li>My dark spots are starting to lighten after a week :).</li>
            <li>My acne dark spots are fading and I notice a more even skin tone and smaller pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 8 days since I&#x27;ve purchased this product and already, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive improvement in my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li>After applying this cream twice a day for two weeks, I have noticed a significant lightening of the dark spots where I have had acne scars for months.</li>
            <li>My mother also uses it as she has freckles and dark spots on her face, and my grandma actually pointed out that her skin looks a lot more clear &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li>I agree that it is a little pricey, for the amount that you get, but from my experience, whitening or evening skin tone products aren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li>My story is a little different than most of the reviewers.</li>
            <li>From other comments I read, people were complaining how if they knew there was less product they would&#x27;ve used it sparingly; however, because of the price, I only used it as a spot treatment, and it lasted me a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I believe that it will help clear your skin up after 6 weeks or a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and helps moisturize my skin, although I have very oily skin its not over thick or moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Now I have to figure out how to correct the breakout and clear my skin.</li>
            <li>it seemed like NOTHING helped clear it up.</li>
            <li>I used this every night before I went to bed and within a month both spots had nearly faded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and so far all I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li>I am 50 yrs old and had started seeing &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The pump action on this has no means to convey product to the nozzle and</li>
            <li>This is NOT satisfactory as far as I&#x27;m concerned when the damage/faultiness was NOT of my doing.</li>
            <li>and so far no results in terms of fading age spots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using for 4 weeks at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling like silk and looking soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks every night but have so far since no results at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>After four weeks, there are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>but I like the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
            <li>Most of the verified reviews are negative.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm... Ive used whole bottle didn&#x27;t see any big results.</li>
            <li>Early on, by means of wishful thinking, I had myself convinced that the sunspots on my face were fading.  </li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s early it&#x27;s not a lot.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed results so far and don&#x27;t think will get now.</li>
            <li>I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling iron burn marks fade dramatically.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>I have stubborn blemishes from adult acne and my skin can be temperamental.</li>
            <li>I had some old acne scars on my chin</li>
            <li>The hyper pigmented spots have faded completely.</li>
            <li>I used this bottle  completely</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I had some old acne scars</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li>I never left the house without foundation and was really stressed.</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Some spots are completely faded while others are almost there.</li>
            <li>Am 32 years old &amp; being proactive.</li>
            <li>I was very patient and used the entire bottle, but no result for me.</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft, but did nothing for my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>After two months of use, my spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li>and I am amazed that my old acne scars have lightened a lot.</li>
            <li>This product has the smell of makeup that is too old.  </li>
            <li>So far i have not seen any results yet.  </li>
            <li>I am waiting for the results but so far I like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling</li>
            <li>A spot that I had on my cheek is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s taking my spots away slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using only this and roc facial</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply on individual dark spots.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into your skin and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Then in the 1970&#x27;s when I was well into my twenties, a form of sunblock/sunscreen became available, but unfortunately, no one really understood the dangers of UVA/UVB rays, and so we would use mediocre drugstore</li>
            <li>BUT I really have not seen much of a difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li>However, when I purchased it the second time around, the product was darker in color and not the same texture as the first bottle.</li>
            <li>It actually took away a decent size sunspot I had on my neck.</li>
            <li>Only been a week, but starting to notice a real difference!</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe acne scars from teen acne, and this product is actually fading them.</li>
            <li>I have used so many spot correctors in the past where you still felt the product on the spots you applied it to or make up would look different in the area over it.</li>
            <li>After reading all the prior reviews, I was highly hopeful this would work</li>
            <li>, I thought there was no pump supplied which would have been a nuisance with continued use, but at second use, I tugged less lightly</li>
            <li>Several years ago I had a few laser treatments which provided very quick results.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky-smooth and actually does what it claims to without feeling harsh or strong .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used to whole bottles of this, twice a day, not missing a single day, but to my dismay, ZERO results.  </li>
            <li>This product really did brighten my face and diminish my leftover acne spots quite a bit, but not completely.</li>
            <li>It does fade dark spots, though - better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since I was a teenager and have scars around my mouth and chin from those deep, deep zits you get around a certain time of the month.</li>
            <li>After trying products like Bio-oil without any success, I didn&#x27;t really think there was a legitimate dark spot corrector cream; I am glad that Vernal has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets paying a little extra for a product that worked so quickly!</li>
            <li>It really helps smooth out uneven skin due to pores.</li>
            <li>As of right now it has done nothing to take away the appearance of the dark spots.  </li>
            <li>After testing this Dark spot corrector cream  out for my self I have to say this Dark spot corrector cream is way better then</li>
            <li>although I use care when frequently washing my hands not to get the tops of my hands wet (and remove the product) that this may have been the case, resulting in product not performing very well.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist recommend at least 2 fl oz to cover the face and most people do not use enough sunscreen to begin with.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use as I think continuous use for several months, based on my results thus far, will completely remove spots.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even slightly lighten the dark spots I have or prevent me from getting more.</li>
            <li>It not only makes my dark spots and acne marks fade quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the expensive big box store products for dark spots but this product is just as good!  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for awhile now and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, a little pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li>I think my skin in general looks brighter.</li>
            <li>help on light colored age spots but not effective on larger,&lt;br /&gt;darker ones.</li>
            <li>The spots are barely noticeable after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>no heavy perfume smell which is a big plus...</li>
            <li>Because mine were relatively recent (last fall), superficial acne scars that were likely to fade anyway, this product has really helped to speed along the process.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this product actually works.</li>
            <li>Had three spots on my face and after using this product I can barely see them anymore.</li>
            <li>my marks have barely lightened...</li>
            <li>So far the product is definitely making my skin softer and I am beginning to see (what I think) is a difference in the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after two weeks I could barely see anything.</li>
            <li>Jury is still out, though, on the dark spot correction, which is why I bought the product in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy specialty products like this, but had an age/sun spot on my upper check for several years that bothered me.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have had NO real breakouts since starting to use this twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I used this religiously twice a day for as long the bottle lasted with absolutely no improvement in the dark spots on my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon showed this as Top Ranked.&lt;br /&gt;It is poor quality at best.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so I guess I am glad it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector can help fix old acne marks as well as new!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a major change on the noticeable dark spots.</li>
            <li>I have tried several fade creams with little success.  </li>
            <li>The dark spots on my face is definitely getting lighter and and the product is very gentle and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have dark spots on the back of both my right an left hands.</li>
            <li>The dark spots have already become lighter on my left hand and the spot on my right hand appears smaller and somewhat lighter.</li>
            <li>After only three weeks of using this the sunspots are much lighter and the old acne scarring is significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li>After using it for only three weeks, the age spots on the backs of my 50 plus year old hands are smaller and faded!</li>
            <li>This is a terrific hand cream--very neutral scent and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li>, I instantly recognized from my earlier research on natural remedies for hyper pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin and the dark spots are still there, but slightly lighter.</li>
            <li>Works very well to reduce dark spots.</li>
            <li>This product really works on dark spots.  </li>
            <li>This product really does fade acne scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li>There were no instructions as far as how long to wait to see visible results.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a tanning bed fanatic, and now - I have a face full of brown spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it really has made a difference!</li>
            <li>So far the bottle is lasting a really long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any major dark spots, just a couple of light small spots that I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nice and thick and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading reviews but after using daily til the bottle ran out, can honestly say there is no lightening of my few subtle dark spots.</li>
            <li>using the product as instructed and i do see changes (lightning) of one particular dark area on my face...</li>
            <li>I have seen a complete difference in my old acne scars and dark spots!</li>

            <li> Very good cream</li>

            <li> Really good quality cream!  </li>
            <li> I never thought that my skin would look THIS GOOD from a spot corrector!</li>
            <li> none of them worked even remotely as good as Vernal!</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, my skin is glowingly beautiful.</li>
            <li> I take religiously good care of my skin as a consultant, but am very fair and acne prone with some blotchiness.</li>
            <li> This is a great over the counter product, though.</li>
            <li> great for lightning spots.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I know 49 bucks seems steep, but you can&#x27;t put a price on feeling great about yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li> A great plus is that it didn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really happy about that.</li>
            <li> but it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I am happy about my purchase and I will continue to use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> well it worked great for me.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was of great quality too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great dosnt leave a sticky greasy residue on you face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to do so since I&#x27;m  getting great results.  </li>
            <li> I will spread the word to anyone in need of a great  product like this.</li>
            <li> Some sun spots have diminished greatly.</li>
            <li> not that great of a product</li>
            <li> Great item..</li>

            <li> I also put it on the backs of my hands where it works great, too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great in combination with this product.</li>
            <li> After having tried a lot of products that promised results, I am really happy to report that his product does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> I have never used a product that has worked so fast!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> With time, this product has produced some amazing results!</li>
            <li> When I decided to try this product I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the best results because it would need more time than 2</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look.</li>
            <li> Very happy and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve used for more youthful skin, including a prescription product from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> it gives good results after continued usage.i ordered this product in exchange of reviews</li>
            <li> but this did a good job.</li>
            <li> Now I can just use spot concealer for work to even out a bit and am good to go.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s realy good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a sign of a good result of my face.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this item so I could get a good feel</li>
            <li> I believe that the results fom the Vernal spot corrector are just as good, one just has to be patient.</li>
            <li> Cream is good on skin but had no effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good Luck to you all.</li>
            <li> I have not used it,expecting a good effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is in fairy good condition.</li>
            <li> This cream isn&#x27;t magically perfect, it doesn&#x27;t work quickly</li>
            <li> Very  pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> For someone with oily/combination skin, it applies nicely and feels good and breathable on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is noticeably more even and my complexion looks very bright and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be getting more when this runs out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Naysayers, use a sunscreen, it won&#x27;t get rid of freckles you are born with, and give it more than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more ecstatic!  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t almost $50 a bottle because I sure need another bottle!</li>
            <li> I tried this product when it first came out and was impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Many compliments came my way after a two weeks of using the wonder cream!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re sure to see an improvement!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> This product is truly magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this corrector!</li>
            <li> I love how this product made my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> It does go on smoothly and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The seller is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed It really helps to perfect blemished skin, and reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast and arrived perfectly.</li>
            <li> apply a nice, even coat.</li>
            <li> This product is effective and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> this nice since I was 35.</li>
            <li> I have a light-med skin but the fair (no 1 ) works better on me .</li>
            <li> I think the price justify a hydrating and effective spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Also using retional and vitamin c products for which this is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> I have really seen an awesome difference in my skin since the beginning.</li>
            <li> The product is okay but not as good as another</li>
            <li> It gets warm on your face.  </li>
            <li> I scrutinized my own face, and yes, I had them too.</li>
            <li> my honest opinion for a promotional price</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the money!</li>
            <li> The serum is light weight and pleasant in odor.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has caused some breaking out for me, but I break out very easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and I am thrilled with the results with Vernal.  </li>
            <li> and he said he liked this one better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to almost eliminate moisturizing (which is good for me, as after trying multiple moisturizers, even the ones that worked best seemed to increase breakouts.)</li>
            <li> This cream is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This was one of the top rated, effective, and affordable.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far..</li>
            <li> Now my skin looks more clear and beautiful!</li>
            <li> The main reason that I splurged on it was because of all the brilliant reviews about how it works wonders on lightening acne scars.</li>
            <li> It balances the fine line between effective but not wreaking your skin to achieve results.</li>
            <li> The results have been very good so far.</li>
            <li> It works so well with my skin and absorbs fully which is a HUGE PLUS!</li>
            <li> I love Vernal products so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I will see more of an improvement on the spot situation.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the fact that the cream pumps out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on.</li>
            <li> I would love to get it more often if it weren&#x27;t so dang pricey.</li>
            <li> I received a weeks worth of samples from my friend and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li> this is it, one more.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve used was hydroquinin 4%, but I can only use it for 2 months before having to switch.</li>
            <li> I tended to get flakiness and dryness with most acne product.  </li>
            <li> The pump packaging is much more sanitary.</li>
            <li> Do make sure you wear sunscreen</li>
            <li> and it gives a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> What I love about this cream is that after a week of use you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> It is just ok.</li>
            <li> With this price I would expect to see more result.</li>
            <li> I do see that more of the reviews are &amp;#34;verified&amp;#34; which I hope means they are authentic.  </li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> For best results to those who say it doesn&#x27;t work for you have to wear SPF sunscreen or you&#x27;re defeating the purpose of it and your spots will come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna buy some more and see where it goes.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> and the results get better and better.</li>
            <li> its ok... meaning from  this moment</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love using it.</li>
            <li> It works well, and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s in my top five favorite anti aging products.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> My sun/age spots have faded and my skin looks brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now; a couple of days ago I was looking in the mirror and realized that my acne scars are really much better and some are non-existent.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff through I love to review.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for many months for a product to lighten the hyperpigmentation in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it gives a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is lovely to use as well--light and creamy.</li>
            <li> For the price, the pump should be made better.</li>
            <li> I will be watching my credit card statement just to be sure</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> but my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, my complexion is brighter, and face smoother.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and tone is more even.</li>
            <li> My face was well hydrated and felt so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product morning and evening around my cheek area and most of my forehead.</li>
            <li> My Maybeline Matte Mousse was enough to give me a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> and the spot on my face is diminishing :-)</li>
            <li> Pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use it some more months.</li>
            <li> It works too so the makeup must be ok.</li>
            <li> I felt that the vitamin C serum I used was better.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks, my sun-damaged skin looked better.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product is useful and effective to my skin problem, so basically I kind regret that I chose to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that with continuous use the spots will fade.</li>
            <li> I am making sure to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use it morning/evening every day, so make sure you keep up with the routine</li>
            <li> I would for sure repurchase :)</li>
            <li> I could notice more of a difference with the sun block.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable wearing no makeup around the house with my roommates, and am close to going out on the town with zero foundation!</li>
            <li> It took more than 1/2 bottle before I saw the result.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, it clears up more.</li>
            <li> More to come</li>
            <li> I have some sun spots on my cheeks that tend to reappear as I get more sun in the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li> and now I have more spots than I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vernel N-E spot corrector to get rid of some &amp;#34;liver&amp;#34; spots on the top of both hands.</li>
            <li> I prefer to resort to cosmetic better than wasting Clinics amount of and without access to a satisfactory outcome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to stick with it.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this product out.</li>
            <li> You would have to buy many bottles and use for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this cream</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for more noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> Better yet, my skin tone seems much more even, my skin feels great andI have not broken out once since using this this product.</li>
            <li> Vernal worked better than City Lights.</li>
            <li> As children, we were encouraged to stay out all day and get the &#x60;healthy sunlight&#x27; and a tan.</li>
            <li> fast shipping - great product</li>
            <li> Perhaps by then I will be able to tell whether it worked on my Melasma condition or not.</li>
            <li> Love love love it..</li>
            <li> I use another Vernal product in the day and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great company.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I was using Clinique before switching to Vernal spot corrector and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied that I ordered another bottle to continue the fading process.  </li>
            <li> Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see how this item works.</li>
            <li> and I can say my acne scars have gone faded significantly!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This product is light, fragrance free and feels nice on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I am in my mid-40&#x27;s, olive complexion, oily skin prone to breakouts, and increasingly dryer skin and fine lines around my eyes needing more TLC.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference, most of my scars are faded and I have a clearer skin tone.</li>
            <li> So far, it is working great.  </li>
            <li> I have even seen my face become more acne free.</li>
            <li> No irritation which is great since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the results and will continue to use it on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> , I am happy with the texture and appearance of my 60+ year old skin since using this product.</li>
            <li> spots are becoming a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> I also loved the packaging which I thought was very chic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes things more fun :)</li>
            <li> always great when you are able to get double amount of product!  </li>
            <li> I also have acne scars since I scar fairly easily.</li>
            <li> This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li> I have problems with hyperpigmentation and this clears it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li> Works great at first with consistent exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks of using it twice a day to see a strong improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> and I believe that my amazing results are in part due to that along with this just being a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever tried for my dark spots...</li>
            <li> Fades dark spot wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
            <li> I also love the way this product has brightened up and evened out my skin tone, and when I put it on it makes my face feel super</li>
            <li> The product really lightens the dark spots and best of all, gives the skin a nice, supple appearance.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, absorbs quickly, and really made my skin look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv Spot Corrector didn&#x27;t have immediate or much noticeable results, but this has been working very good so far.</li>
            <li> My acne worsened  and as a result, I had very dark acne spots all over my face that even the best concealer couldn&#x27;t conceal.</li>
            <li> I need to wait longer before I can give an accurate review.  </li>
            <li> works great on the skin, I saw a big difference in months.</li>
            <li> I received the product free in return for my review.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin blemish free and ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> product itself feels light and creamy.</li>
            <li> Smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my skin, and it&#x27;s most definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> But really, this serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on like silk and leaves your skin soo smooth.</li>
            <li> Now when I apply light foundation to my face you can&#x27;t see some of the sun spots I used to have on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Is light and airy on skin.</li>
            <li> rather it&#x27;s a light cream</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle I decided to review and give honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I could tell instantly how great it is.  </li>
            <li> Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li> Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample, and I am usually really harsh about my sample reviews so that customers are informed, and I want to say this product works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, and because of it&#x27;s price at $49.95 I really wasn&#x27;t sure...</li>
            <li> I feel that the money is very worth</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin that has acne scars and after using it exactly as directed, my skin tone is looking more even</li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh non oily looking on my face and gives me a beautiful glow instantly.</li>
            <li> Patience is well worth it with this cream!</li>
            <li> Patience with this cream is worth it!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet and I am already seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is perfect and there is none of the coffee house aroma I associate with skin lightening products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost because I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> Patience is well worth it with this cream!</li>
            <li> This product was so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Its totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a month and have already seen some results of my scars lightening significantly from what they used to look like.</li>
            <li> That said, everyone is unique and therefore what works for me may not for you.</li>
            <li> It goes onto the skin without tugging and is easily absorbed - and - for me - works!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two months since my original purchase</li>
            <li> take advantage of this product I  purchased after reading most of the review of customers where I am impressed by what is said about ,  and what I suffer from a remote spot in my face time in the cheeks area took me enthusiasm to buy this magical product that I&#x27;m  looking for from long time. .</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and was willing to go for something that promised good results.  </li>
            <li> It has a light and dries fairly quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> My face and neck was now clear of the sunspots, which made the sunspots on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; even more prominent.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and much cheaper than some of the other options and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they sell a large size.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many spot corrector products and none seem to make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try something different and it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I would and have recommended this product to several friends, family and co-workers who all loved it as well.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it dries and is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been able to step out of the house make-up free, and i love it.</li>
            <li> Will update when used longer to review true darkspot correction claim.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve still yet to see full results with this.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t expect full results yet anyway</li>
            <li> I will keep you posted if I see the full results I am after.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> I waited until I used my full bottle before leaving a review.</li>
            <li> I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it smells kinda &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and kinda flowerish, but scent disappears after application and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> great fragrance, not bleachy like other spot correctors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reduced the appearance of most of blemishes I&#x27;ve had and my skin complexion is starting to look more radiant and even.</li>
            <li> Since I just started using, I can&#x27;t provide an adequate review for awhile.</li>
            <li> overall complexion is much  more even, and holds onto moisture much better as a result of it&#x27;s healthier state.  </li>
            <li> Given more time, I hope that this product will resolve most of the issues I have with the discoloration as I have noticed some change, but it has been only a week.</li>
            <li> I use it for redness and scarring on my face and it has helped lighten it tremendously.</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed to see these kinds of results so quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not expect for this product to work so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the proactive pads help boost the effectiveness of the product and why I&#x27;m  seeing results so quickly.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> As a mild acid would feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, and has helped to clear up my acne scarring fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin and not greasy like so many other creams/oils &amp; lotions.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report after a week of use the dark spots on my face are beginning to fade</li>
            <li> I normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for most products I buy.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I. Have been using this product for a week now, my skin feel better, but I will give it a little more try before I can fully comments on it, so far so good</li>
            <li> But I love the way my skin feels and looks so much from this cream that I would actually purchase again for use as a really incredible daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Though this product seems perfect and has great reviews , I was hesitant because of some of the poor reviews by other users.</li>
            <li> One needs to be more patient, when using new products.</li>
            <li> But my skin looks great, and in another few months - I think I may have lightened these spots to the point of not having to use full coverage makeup at all times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best skin care product I have tried to treat dark spots and discoloration</li>
            <li> :) Oh, I also have very sensitive skin and have had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spot corrector for only 2 WEEKS - and I already love it!</li>
            <li> This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> but my bareface complexion is now almost as good as I could previously get with light bb cream coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to go for something like Intense Pulse Light</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but it did ship fast and free from damage.</li>
            <li> I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing</li>
            <li> I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing</li>
            <li> Most of the ingredients are simple effective, natural ingredients including licorice root which is said to help with hyper pigmentation/dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li> It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> is gonna be worth the money or not.</li>
            <li> : I really needed more time to review this, but the website I&#x27;m suppose to write this review for wants it now.</li>
            <li> It is pricey for my taste; however, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is better than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried and believe me when I say I have spent more money on products that do not work.</li>
            <li> Its worth it if you have the income.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt it is worth the money</li>
            <li> In exchange for this product this is an honest and personal review.</li>
            <li> This cream is a nice consistency but that is it&#x27;s only quality.</li>
            <li> So far i love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> After the whole 3 months people were actually commenting on how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I like this product I can feel my eyes fresh and smithing</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Mostly from old acne scarring.</li>
            <li> something year old skin is just more stubborn about releasing the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> My natural complexion is a lot more even now.</li>
            <li> Mostly from old acne scarring.</li>
            <li> My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li> My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even.</li>
            <li> It takes time, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s going to be worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely post review when amazon ask me to.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> --I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and the troublesome spots that have been on my face for awhile now have begun to fade; I imagine if I actually stuck to the regimen properly (once in morning and night), it would work better, but sometimes I forget so it has worked good for someone like myself who is pretty forgetful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any significant results.</li>
            <li> then the ones on my right.</li>
            <li> All the spots on my right hand are practically invisible.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is</li>
            <li> The visible improvement is a confirmation that we have made the right purchase.</li>
            <li> I slide it on right after showering and it is creamy enough to serve as a pretty nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so happy that I will never have to waste money trying out spot correctors again because this one is an absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle and yet effective dark spot corrector!</li>
            <li> Nothing SUPER magical happened but after almost 1 month of using this every day, my skin is smoother, clearer, and my acne scars are definitely lightened.</li>
            <li> As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this Vernal N-E Dark spot corrector cream in the mail!!!!</li>
            <li> I have finished the first bottle of this cream and see a distinct fading of brown spots.  </li>
            <li> The lotion was fine on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A light-weighted, silky smooth, and fragrance free facial cream.</li>
            <li> Also, as a HUGE bonus I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne has cleared up considerably!</li>
            <li> My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li> My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 4 days of use and I already notice a difference in my skin, will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the cream would do well because it&#x27;s very light, but it turns out that has allowed it to actually stay on my face because it blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave an after-film or oily residue that would make me want to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to see too much change within the first month, however I am blown away!</li>
            <li> I have used many high end dark spot corrector products ,but this one acts better and faster than all others on the market.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> However, you have to be consistent, and applied it twice a day.</li>
            <li> is it makes my skin very oily!  </li>
            <li> Bottle is pretty, but its too soon to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> The cream had turned a blue-purple color on my leg which at first startled me thinking I had hit my leg and then realized it is the product that can be wiped off.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, this is my second Order.</li>
            <li> I have had this just a short time but noticed a lovely glowing skin feel and appearance.</li>
            <li> First of all, this has done wonders for my skin texture and helping with skin turnover.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pricey beauty product person, but I&#x27;m impressed enough with the results that I&#x27;ve bought a second bottle while still only part way through the first one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the bottle I received was defective because I had to break it open to get any out.</li>
            <li> old with light complexion and tried this product for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin looked more clear than it normally does.</li>
            <li> It is a sigh of relief especially since I&#x27;ve bought many products that claim to fade sun spots</li>
            <li> really, really does fade sun spots!</li>
            <li> and I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I&#x27;ll come back for a better review.</li>
            <li> This is my first serum corrector that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you stick to it, you&#x27;ll really see results!</li>
            <li> I used every bit of this product exactly as directed and got zero results.  </li>
            <li> From the first squirt, the pump dislocated and did not work.  </li>
            <li> I asked for a sample of this first since it is pricey, but after using it for just one week which is what the sample size lasted for, I went in and bought the full-size product.</li>
            <li> Will most likely have to buy another bottle soon.  </li>
            <li> I was assured that I&#x27;d receive another bottle at no charge, and sure enough I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift at first for my mother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 weeks now and 80% of my acne scars have faded.</li>
            <li> Love it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> so my first application</li>
            <li> I will be back for more</li>
            <li> I am confident enough after trying this to buy the whole line!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> My spots look lighter and my skin has an overall more even appearance.</li>
            <li> Funny on the packaging</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize but not enough for my skin which needs more hydration.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked at all the ingredients and studied each and every one but some of the first ingredients</li>
            <li> After years in the sun I have a definite &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; along my cheekbones and up by my temples, and even the most concentrated spot has lightened already.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products over the years</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try this product first.</li>
            <li> It was funny looking and embarrassing to wear.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!)</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!)</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable and received right away.</li>
            <li> At the very least, it made a good toner!</li>
            <li> It gets the 3 stars because it does make my skin feel different, in a positive way, as if it&#x27;s retaining moisture better.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much more even now, and the dark spots are significantly fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many many many reviews, and it seems to me that you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and sinks into the skin quickly and is not greasy in the slightest way!</li>
            <li> This product is nice on the skin, light and soft and did wonders on clearing my skin of sun spots and also brighten some dark spots I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> But wow I was so excited to start using it when it came in my mail and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used other products skin lightening cream that have not been as effective</li>
            <li> Ordering was quick &amp; easy ... received order quickly, but the product is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product and will continue to use to combat dark spots!!! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not yet ready to go completely coverup-foundation free for work for example</li>
            <li> I tried a few products before trying out the Vernal NE spot corrector and to my surprised this product worked out great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much younger - fresh appearance, minimized pores, smooth to touch.</li>
            <li> A lot of the positive reviews in here are not &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li> This product feels very nice on my face, absorbs fast and not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for my dark spots which were caused by the sun.</li>
            <li> I already seen very visible and very comparable results!</li>
            <li> First of all - I can&#x27;t really review this for age/brown spot removal as that is not my issue.  </li>
            <li> In other words, my skin does not have bleached or white patches where the age spots have been erased or greatly minimized.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed by how fast I&#x27;ve started to see real results (about 3 weeks) and can&#x27;t wait to see them at 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> It is a nice day moisturizer under makeup, but dark sport corrector???</li>
            <li> This is a staple of my morning routine, I easily look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream at a great discount in hopes that this was the last product that I would have to purchase since I have tried everything to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Why would my honest review be hidden.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a period of great skin distress in order to even out the dark spots which were left over.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dark spots around my eyes and cheeks my entire life, and this product has been great for me.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a smaller, travel tube that I could carry in my purse easily, though.</li>
            <li> I have three large age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It comes in a heft large bottle for the amount of cream inside (1 fl oz).</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t disappeared, but there is noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> It protects against future age spot development with a balanced composition of stabilized vitamin C, &amp; Zinc PCA.This Vernal N-E Dark Spot corrector cream helps brighten &amp; even out skin tone and promotes long-term radiance revealing a more radiant glow!!</li>
            <li> I guess I bought it with very high expectations.</li>
            <li> and I did not saw any results whatsoever I had very high expectations for that.</li>
            <li> I will say what I mainly noticed is that treating the spots as they appear has a higher success rate than treating those that are a couple of years old.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and living in Hawaii is hard for me to not go in the sun</li>
            <li> This is amazing I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to experience the radical improvement that others did, but I did and I can definitely tell there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li> They are not gone but so much lighter.</li>
            <li> I really like how the cream makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I really like how it just smooths out everything on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> my skin is much brighter and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot</li>
            <li> I think the collagen booster and this work really well together.</li>
            <li> and i havent noticed much</li>
            <li> too much time involved for</li>
            <li> I have tried product after product to reduce the blemishes on my face and neck, and have not had much luck.</li>
            <li> I used the item for 2 weeks, but it says you need 4 to see real</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second this is truly gentle.  </li>
            <li> fast forward to February of this year.</li>
            <li> expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> I think that it really depends on the type of marks you seek to reduce.</li>
            <li> I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> It seems to cause a gentle peeling.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to assess, but I do love the cool, moisturizing feel.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.</li>
            <li> So I was not expecting much when I tried this out.</li>
            <li> have light skin with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> and I can all ready see results.</li>
            <li> I have 2 very visible brown age spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my redness after 2 weeks of applying this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - April 9th - Customer service from seller is great and I immediately received a phone call regarding the broken pump.  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing to fade or disappear freckles, age spots or anything on the skin.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for her</li>
            <li> I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple months and  really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in skin clarity.  </li>
            <li> Yep, it really does just what they say.</li>
            <li> Today as I got ready to step out, I  did not wear any concealer.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t really say that this product performs as advertised, maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  </li>
            <li> Did not see much difference</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much difference except in the softness of my skin</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and, after using for about a month, she really likes it for her face.</li>
            <li> I hear it is really satisfactory.</li>
            <li> But looks promising.</li>
            <li> This product did almost nothing for me after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> in skin tone, much smoother and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that has worked so fast.</li>
            <li> Is it reasonable to buy a month this amount with the payment of shipping charges and how much of the jar can be consumed to get the result lethal ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear that much foundation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Over the course of the month I really started noticing my acne scars had started to lighten up a lot.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much changed at this point...</li>
            <li> I expected more visible result but nothing at all.</li>
            <li> It feels very silky on the skin, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free/promotional item and it has done very well.</li>
            <li> it really work</li>
            <li> I use approx one pump and rub it over my entire face twice a day, and I feel that there is more evenness to my skin and some of the old acne marks that I had towards my jaw area have grown fainter and some disappeared.</li>
            <li> but the overall appearance of my skin is rejuvenated and much more clear, even from acne or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but a pretty good effect for less cost and hassle than a medical office treatment.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see how large the bottle is; it will last a good long while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some fading of my dark spots and will continue using twice a day in hopes of seeing more positive results.</li>
            <li> After having thyroid cancer and my hormones out of whack, I began developing this horrid large brown spots on my face - the most troublesome was the dark spots that looked like a mustache.</li>
            <li> I have noticed better results with this product in a shorter period of time than other products.</li>
            <li> I find I need to use more of this than some other reviewers to get results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing amazing results, but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for about 20 days now and the dark spots are really fading and my skin tone got much better over all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month and have noticed that my dark spots appear a bit lighter which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li> What an amazing little product!</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t seen significant dark spot reduction yet, but my skin feels SO soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The texture of the product is very nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The blotchy areas are fading and I&#x27;m making sure I use sunscreen daily in my foundation to avoid making my hyper pigmentation worse and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a year - has lighted up a few very dark spots - best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> The corrector cream helped with many of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> In my teenage years, sunblock was introduced to the public, and it was a greasy white zinc oxide that fair complexioned children wore on their noses.</li>
            <li> After a summer full of sun this totally recorrects any sun spots I may have!</li>
            <li> It has little scent, so doesn&#x27;t clash with any other scents one might be wearing, and is very silky and not greasy, so it leaves a very nice surface for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> When I get half way thru the bottle, I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The spots appear to have faded slightly, but I am almost thru one container and would have thought I would have seen a more substantial change.  </li>
            <li> The ones on my left had were darker and more numerous</li>
            <li> Thank you for helping a slightly older woman like what she sees in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a money back guarantee thingy because this would go back for sure.</li>
            <li> and I see tremendous improvements in sun spots/ age spots around the back of my hands, shoulders and cheeks.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin is EXTREMELY smooth and my overall skin tone is lighter.</li>
            <li> While I used it all over my face, I had a circle of brown spots which was my main test site.  </li>
            <li> cap was hard at first to remove for me and I ended up yanking the whole top off</li>
            <li> The product itself absorb into my skin quickly and the 2oz bottle really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for brighter skin.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this produce</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I had been using the product from City Lights for greater than 6 months with no significant nor lightening effects.</li>
            <li> Comedones are much reduced, almost completely eliminated.  </li>
            <li> They were old very superficial.</li>
            <li> Good, but too small, it only lasts one week.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in things like this normally.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better quality for this price but it was waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin complexion has also improved, it&#x27;s now more even and balanced with few discolored blotchy areas.</li>
            <li> The spots were darkest and most noticeable on my chin, but I have a few freckles across my nose that I was hoping would fade a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely like it and am definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was not so expensive, as I need to now maintain this regiment, but as long as it works so well, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product was worth beyond the price because it ACTUALLY DELIVERS RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only A FEW DAYS - and I already love it!</li>
            <li> but this product really worked, I had two very large dark/age spots (size of a dime) on my face that got even darker due to going to Hawaii and being out in the sun so much.</li>
            <li> The second bottle was less effective even with the same regimen I used with the first.  </li>
            <li> I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience.</li>
            <li> I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience.</li>
            <li> Put in a request to Vernal for a new pump</li>
            <li> I will place  review when i get my new bottle.</li>
            <li> I stop using the medication the dermatologist prescribed and order the new proactive.</li>
            <li> were not all new.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading yet but will continue using the cream till it&#x27;s empty and will write more later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell the results but he has high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this goes on like a dream.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are so light and my skin tone has evened out.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I find is worth the money and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll start seeing results within the week if you use it religiously ;)</li>
            <li> I have for the last month been dabbing it on my 10-12 facial brown spots with twice a day (still on original bottle).</li>
            <li> Plus many other comparable products are only 1 oz</li>
            <li> I had recently got my first sun spot</li>
            <li> I have tried many other things and this actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect Vernal to vanish my blemishes overnight, but they are fading quickly so far!</li>
            <li> It really is solid product, I will be buying it again once I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product in January it was my first time using anything from vernal and with the mixed reviews</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products, but this one has helped me out the most. .</li>
            <li> I tried many creams in the past: Clinique, Estee Lauder, Shiseido, MD-7, vita-K, and bunch of others.  </li>
            <li> I have about 1/4 of the first bottle left.  </li>
            <li> The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away.</li>
            <li> The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away.</li>
            <li> I have been an active person all of my life - spending much of my time outside in the summer, which has resulted in additional fine lines and sun spots.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are starting to lighten after a week :).</li>
            <li> My acne dark spots are fading and I notice a more even skin tone and smaller pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 8 days since I&#x27;ve purchased this product and already, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive improvement in my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> After applying this cream twice a day for two weeks, I have noticed a significant lightening of the dark spots where I have had acne scars for months.</li>
            <li> My mother also uses it as she has freckles and dark spots on her face, and my grandma actually pointed out that her skin looks a lot more clear &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li> I agree that it is a little pricey, for the amount that you get, but from my experience, whitening or evening skin tone products aren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> My story is a little different than most of the reviewers.</li>
            <li> From other comments I read, people were complaining how if they knew there was less product they would&#x27;ve used it sparingly; however, because of the price, I only used it as a spot treatment, and it lasted me a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I believe that it will help clear your skin up after 6 weeks or a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and helps moisturize my skin, although I have very oily skin its not over thick or moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Now I have to figure out how to correct the breakout and clear my skin.</li>
            <li> it seemed like NOTHING helped clear it up.</li>
            <li> I used this every night before I went to bed and within a month both spots had nearly faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and so far all I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li> I am 50 yrs old and had started seeing &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The pump action on this has no means to convey product to the nozzle and</li>
            <li> This is NOT satisfactory as far as I&#x27;m concerned when the damage/faultiness was NOT of my doing.</li>
            <li> and so far no results in terms of fading age spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using for 4 weeks at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling like silk and looking soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks every night but have so far since no results at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> After four weeks, there are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> but I like the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
            <li> Most of the verified reviews are negative.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm... Ive used whole bottle didn&#x27;t see any big results.</li>
            <li> Early on, by means of wishful thinking, I had myself convinced that the sunspots on my face were fading.  </li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s early it&#x27;s not a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed results so far and don&#x27;t think will get now.</li>
            <li> I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling iron burn marks fade dramatically.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn blemishes from adult acne and my skin can be temperamental.</li>
            <li> I had some old acne scars on my chin</li>
            <li> The hyper pigmented spots have faded completely.</li>
            <li> I used this bottle  completely</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I had some old acne scars</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li> I never left the house without foundation and was really stressed.</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Some spots are completely faded while others are almost there.</li>
            <li> Am 32 years old &amp; being proactive.</li>
            <li> I was very patient and used the entire bottle, but no result for me.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft, but did nothing for my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> After two months of use, my spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed that my old acne scars have lightened a lot.</li>
            <li> This product has the smell of makeup that is too old.  </li>
            <li> So far i have not seen any results yet.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting for the results but so far I like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling</li>
            <li> A spot that I had on my cheek is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s taking my spots away slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using only this and roc facial</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply on individual dark spots.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into your skin and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Then in the 1970&#x27;s when I was well into my twenties, a form of sunblock/sunscreen became available, but unfortunately, no one really understood the dangers of UVA/UVB rays, and so we would use mediocre drugstore</li>
            <li> BUT I really have not seen much of a difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> However, when I purchased it the second time around, the product was darker in color and not the same texture as the first bottle.</li>
            <li> It actually took away a decent size sunspot I had on my neck.</li>
            <li> Only been a week, but starting to notice a real difference!</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe acne scars from teen acne, and this product is actually fading them.</li>
            <li> I have used so many spot correctors in the past where you still felt the product on the spots you applied it to or make up would look different in the area over it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the prior reviews, I was highly hopeful this would work</li>
            <li> , I thought there was no pump supplied which would have been a nuisance with continued use, but at second use, I tugged less lightly</li>
            <li> Several years ago I had a few laser treatments which provided very quick results.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky-smooth and actually does what it claims to without feeling harsh or strong .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to whole bottles of this, twice a day, not missing a single day, but to my dismay, ZERO results.  </li>
            <li> This product really did brighten my face and diminish my leftover acne spots quite a bit, but not completely.</li>
            <li> It does fade dark spots, though - better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since I was a teenager and have scars around my mouth and chin from those deep, deep zits you get around a certain time of the month.</li>
            <li> After trying products like Bio-oil without any success, I didn&#x27;t really think there was a legitimate dark spot corrector cream; I am glad that Vernal has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets paying a little extra for a product that worked so quickly!</li>
            <li> It really helps smooth out uneven skin due to pores.</li>
            <li> As of right now it has done nothing to take away the appearance of the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> After testing this Dark spot corrector cream  out for my self I have to say this Dark spot corrector cream is way better then</li>
            <li> although I use care when frequently washing my hands not to get the tops of my hands wet (and remove the product) that this may have been the case, resulting in product not performing very well.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommend at least 2 fl oz to cover the face and most people do not use enough sunscreen to begin with.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use as I think continuous use for several months, based on my results thus far, will completely remove spots.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even slightly lighten the dark spots I have or prevent me from getting more.</li>
            <li> It not only makes my dark spots and acne marks fade quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the expensive big box store products for dark spots but this product is just as good!  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for awhile now and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, a little pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I think my skin in general looks brighter.</li>
            <li> help on light colored age spots but not effective on larger,&lt;br /&gt;darker ones.</li>
            <li> The spots are barely noticeable after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> no heavy perfume smell which is a big plus...</li>
            <li> Because mine were relatively recent (last fall), superficial acne scars that were likely to fade anyway, this product has really helped to speed along the process.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product actually works.</li>
            <li> Had three spots on my face and after using this product I can barely see them anymore.</li>
            <li> my marks have barely lightened...</li>
            <li> So far the product is definitely making my skin softer and I am beginning to see (what I think) is a difference in the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after two weeks I could barely see anything.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out, though, on the dark spot correction, which is why I bought the product in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy specialty products like this, but had an age/sun spot on my upper check for several years that bothered me.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have had NO real breakouts since starting to use this twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I used this religiously twice a day for as long the bottle lasted with absolutely no improvement in the dark spots on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon showed this as Top Ranked.&lt;br /&gt;It is poor quality at best.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so I guess I am glad it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector can help fix old acne marks as well as new!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a major change on the noticeable dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried several fade creams with little success.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face is definitely getting lighter and and the product is very gentle and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on the back of both my right an left hands.</li>
            <li> The dark spots have already become lighter on my left hand and the spot on my right hand appears smaller and somewhat lighter.</li>
            <li> After only three weeks of using this the sunspots are much lighter and the old acne scarring is significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After using it for only three weeks, the age spots on the backs of my 50 plus year old hands are smaller and faded!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific hand cream--very neutral scent and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li> , I instantly recognized from my earlier research on natural remedies for hyper pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I have light skin and the dark spots are still there, but slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce dark spots.</li>
            <li> This product really works on dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product really does fade acne scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions as far as how long to wait to see visible results.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a tanning bed fanatic, and now - I have a face full of brown spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it really has made a difference!</li>
            <li> So far the bottle is lasting a really long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major dark spots, just a couple of light small spots that I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and thick and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading reviews but after using daily til the bottle ran out, can honestly say there is no lightening of my few subtle dark spots.</li>
            <li> using the product as instructed and i do see changes (lightning) of one particular dark area on my face...</li>
            <li> I have seen a complete difference in my old acne scars and dark spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and tried this out to get rid of two new dark spots</li>
            <li> I took a chance after reading other reviews, and after about 4-6 weeks of using this product my spot is COMPLETELY gone, not faded, gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now and my dark spots are almost completely faded!</li>
            <li> So, after trying the Murad &amp; Philosophy dark spot correctors with little success, I ordered the Vernal NE spot corrector product out of desperation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are someone who is dedicated to the cause of ridding yourself of dark spots!</li>
            <li> The small freckles I have had all my adult life are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Frequent use of hydroquinone left dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28, but I have some dark spots from sun damage and old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Its creamy format makes it easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have an awful medicine smell which I love.  </li>
            <li> I usually wait until I&#x27;ve used a product for 2+ weeks before I write a review, but this one really delivered.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on old scarring on my face which has lightened up.</li>
            <li> I will update this review once I see whether the dark spots are lightening considerably.</li>
            <li> It faded the freckles on my cheekbones and dark spots near the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can usually get by on one pump two times a day, but it does go fast.</li>
            <li> I developed these dark spots after I had my children and after medications from the doctor didn&#x27;t work, I thought nothing would...</li>
            <li> It faded the freckles on my cheekbones and dark spots near the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have past acne scarring, and this really helps with it.</li>
            <li> Also I already notice a difference in minor sun spots, and an overall smoothness to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Although some of my spots have not completely faded, I would recommend this product just on the improvement I have seen alone and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will continue to use as long as necessary!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet</li>
            <li> After using it just two weeks, I already notice a difference in minor sun spots, and an overall smoothness to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Hoping the lotion works as stated since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it got good ratings.</li>
            <li> This product took only two months to completely rid me of my dark spots!</li>
            <li> Based on the high price of it, it is totally not worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> For the money a complete waste would definitely not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> but the result is the opposite expected did not get on any result where I used the entire bottle to no avail</li>
            <li> A few are large enough to be a nuisance and I have tried a few corrector solutions that either flat out did not work at all or left my face feeling so oily (Bio-oil)</li>
            <li> I applied this product religiously every single day twice a day for those two months</li>
            <li> My skin did not have any reaction to this - positive or negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless of other things and never worked and this seems to be the key to working.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I gave this serum a chance, I don&#x27;t typically do reviews for skincare products but for anyone who has felt frustrated from dark spots, don&#x27;t look any further you must give this product a try!</li>
            <li> The cream is very thin and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I felt a need to splurge on this product since I am getting enganged and although makeup offers the help I need to cover my acne scars, I wanted a little piece of mind and security .</li>
            <li> Finally, after two times a day of 46 days&#x27; religiously using, it only accomplished a little result of which I thought it might at least erases freckles on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I recently went to a dermatologist who told me there was nothing I could do for the spots on my face, I am 42 and the dark spots were too deep.</li>
            <li> Some spots are barely visible while the really dark spots have turn reddish-brown which is a sign that the melanin in the skin is fading.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clear up a few spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have some discoloration from the sun and a medication that made my skin sensitive to the sun and created some blotchy areas a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I am actually reviewing this on my scar,  not really an age spot treatment.</li>
            <li> me waited one day too long to return it.</li>
            <li> Idk how long its supposed to take to show results.</li>
            <li> I did see some minimal fading after a month&#x27;s use (in which time I used the entire bottle).  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product because after going to a dermatologist for having a few breakouts here and there, a dermatologist prescribed me acne medication that completely ruined my skin.</li>
            <li> I had minor amount of hyperpigmentation and post-acne scarring.</li>
            <li> the cost of others and my skin has improved and brightened within a few weeks, and my old makeup looks orange now.</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference after 6 weeks of twice a day religious use.</li>
            <li> However, in fairness, I don&#x27;t believe that I have been using the product long enough to see any improvement in the dark spots, which I anticipate to take several weeks-several months.  </li>
            <li> Acne marks and dark spots have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to cut back or even quit due to the cost, but nothing else has worked as well, so I always return.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that works, but unfortunately this product did NOTHING to reduce the spots from my skin!</li>
            <li> given that you have to use it consecutively like any other regular product out there.</li>
            <li> Lines are less noticeable and my skin definitely looks firmer and more youthful (skin looks less puffy in some spots, less sagging in others, less tired in general).  </li>
            <li> /acne treatment make my skin dry and flake cycle.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out, dry my skin, make me oily....</li>
            <li> I bought two of these bottles and by the second bottle, only a few spots were gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactive for two weeks now and have no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I apply a little on each spot (which is a lot) and rub it in in the general area.</li>
            <li> a few other brighteners and dark spot correctors and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out.</li>
            <li> a few other brighteners and dark spot correctors and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out.</li>
            <li> and so far they have faded very little</li>
            <li> I put the dark spot corrector cream on and let it dry, later I looked at my leg where I applied the cream and it looked</li>
            <li> I am no longer self-conscious because the dark freckles on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; are considerably lighter and less dense.</li>
            <li> I am no longer self-conscious because the dark freckles on my décolleté are considerably lighter and less dense.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because I would like to prevent future dark skin spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I do not currently have dark spots</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen improvement in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I can tell a big difference in the reduction of redness and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I also had a couple dark spots in the back of my hand</li>
            <li> and now my areas of dark spots (upper lip, cheeks, and nose) have faded dramatically.</li>
            <li> As a result, I do have quite a bit of dark spots - both brownish and red scars.</li>
            <li> She did not comment on whether the creme actually reduced dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about a week or so and am seeing my dark spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;ll give Vernal Spot Corrector a try to reduce the dark spots on my back.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spot and I tried different products before.</li>
            <li> My dark spots look the same.</li>
            <li> Not only did my dark spots and acne scars get lighter, my freckles have faded.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that I can see dark spots on my face reduce.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually works as a dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> of course applying regular SPF keeps the dark spots away</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with dark spots.</li>
            <li> Last winter I ordered the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream, but then while at my dermatologist, I was offered a CO2 treatment.</li>
            <li> However, as summer started, I noticed that my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; was dark with freckles (sunspots), enough to make me feel self-conscious about wearing some of my summer clothes.</li>
            <li> My dark marks have faded immensely, I&#x27;m not breaking out as often and when I do</li>
            <li> It is very obvious that my dark spots has faded.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it daily, and expect to see some results down the road.</li>
            <li> Since you only need so little, the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I never right reviews but wanted to write this to help offset the negative reviews and to let others know that thisis a miracle product for real.</li>
            <li> Its also formulated with Diacetyl Boldine and Pro-Cysteine, dark spots on the skins surface begin to fade and encourages new cell growth &amp; consumer Trials found: In 88% of users saw fewer dark spots in just 8 weeks!!  </li>
            <li> It works better than those other expensive serums out there!</li>
            <li> It works better than those other expensive serums out there!</li>
            <li> In the past year, I was left with acne marks from when I was younger.</li>
            <li> The dark spot are the very same as before, absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden an ugly dark spot seemed to prominently appear out of nowhere on my face when I hit 45.</li>
            <li> I got this product for the great reviews, but I have to say that I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it has only been a little over two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, only one time a day rather than two</li>
            <li> maybe a little lightening but not enough to notice</li>
            <li> I saw a little difference in my skin, but nothing super dramatic.</li>
            <li> It may take a few weeks to notice any changes and a few months to notice more dramatic changes, but you will notice a gradual fading of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties and I had started to notice that many people in my age bracket had those ugly brown sunspots on their faces.</li>
            <li> It made acne scars that I have had for at least five years fade to nearly nothing.</li>
            <li> It made acne scars that I have had for at least five years fade to nearly nothing.</li>
            <li> the money I really expected some results...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I used it for a month day and night on a few recent acne scars and there is no fading whatsoever on them!</li>
            <li> Overall, after using it for a few months I feel that it has made some difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just use it only on a few darker acne scars, for cost-effectiveness</li>
            <li> Have not really seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using this Vernal spot corrector I can already see a difference in the uneven colorations on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I added 100 sun block on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> After only three weeks of using this spot corrector I can already see a difference in the uneven colorations on my face.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a month now not much change in the sunspots.  </li>
            <li> It did lighten the dark spots on my face, but did not completely eliminate them.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say, but that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> While it took a few months to erase (applied twice daily), I no longer see the spot.</li>
            <li> have to say that I see difference in the appearance of my scar only after a few time of using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using the product until the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little dark on the back of my neck</li>
            <li> It is too soon to see any reduction is dark spots but hoping to see it&#x27;s affects in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product does not help clear dark marks, well at least not mines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for the past two years and recently purchased multiple products to try and tame my skin.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended with absolutely no change in my dark sport...</li>
            <li> Unlike other spot correctors I&#x27;ve used in this past this product has actually delivered.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> While using this I was pairing it with other Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li> The small amount needed makes the product last for MONTHS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use I will see some difference in the sun spots since it&#x27;s pretty expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face as directed for over 6 weeks and so absolutely no sign of the dark spots lightening.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product seems to work, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> Not sure it actually works as I have just received it, but the pump broke after one use and now I have to unscrew the lid to get lotion out.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, which creates acne, which in turn, creates scaring on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 + months morning and evening along with sunscreen and (extremely dissapointed)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no chemical smell that I&#x27;ve found with other products and it seems to work naturally not just some gimmicky chemical ointment.  </li>
            <li> had acne scars on both my face, and neck and was overwhelmed and extremely depressed</li>
            <li> After trying other spot correctors in the market I decided to move forward with this one.</li>
            <li> In terms of radiance, I literally did a double take as I walked past the mirror one morning after about two weeks of using the product.  </li>
            <li> But for the other improvements alone I give this a 5.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I thought that my spots were so bad I would have to go to some high priced dermatologist for some high priced treatment to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I am not perfect about using it as much as they say, but I can notice the dark age-spots are lighter (not my imagination), and the lines are a little softer and not so deep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but they leave my face looking strange and pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but they leave my face looking strange and pale.</li>
            <li> I have hyper pigmentation and get really frustrated with how easily my face marks from blemishes and bug bites.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the cream for almost two weeks now and my dark marks from my past breakouts are actually fading!</li>
            <li> They are still slightly visible, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I find those use harsh chemicals that dry out my skin and cause flakes.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but my friend swore up and down that it would work after a couple months.</li>
            <li> This cleared my acne, along with other Vernal products, and got rid of my dark spots within weeks.</li>
            <li> but unlike other dark spot correctors I have tried, this Vernal Cream EALLY does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit extreme to claim that you can visibly reduce dark spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I just placed the order of this product, if anyone kno that I can use vernal dark spot corrector with other nighttime treatment?</li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading and some other of my skin spots are clearing up.  </li>
            <li> Used it for 3 months twice a day and saw very minimal reduction in dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried in the past!!!This dark spot corrector cream</li>
            <li> I have yet to notice any difference in dark spots.</li>
            <li> gold .The creme is for dark spots and also has a matte affect (which is always a plus)for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream works.  </li>
            <li> skin is dark and I suffer from hyperpigmentation  from post acne issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen my dark spots fade dramatically.</li>
            <li> but I amstill using my dark spot will be gone after 3 week</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots that are either that or freckles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it in the hope that a dark spot on my face is lightened.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and get a dark spot after every breakout.</li>
            <li> It faded those dark marks by 95% in about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend Proactiv&#x27;s dark spot corrector over it.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed in 4-5 weeks time my dark spots and freckles have diminished and my skin has an even tone to it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no difference in my skin and my dark spots have not gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> Look, I&#x27;ve tried all of the high-market dark spot correctors from Clinique  all across the spectrum.  </li>
            <li> None helped remove dark spots from my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone akin and get a dark spot after every breakout.</li>
            <li> and I can tell already, the dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> It said it would rid You of any dark spots</li>
            <li> My dark spots still there.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even care about dark spots</li>
            <li> Have been using twice a day for 2 weeks now for dark spots and achne blemishes.</li>
            <li> Still have dark Spots on my hands</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my face, and this product seems to be helping to make them lighter.</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots, puffy eyes, and my acne scars are still showing.</li>
            <li> Visibly corrected my dark spot as it promised.</li>
            <li> but all the dark spots ust start disappearing.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any changes in my dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some lighten and dark spot correction already and again</li>
            <li> This product fades dark spots and minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no difference in my skin and my dark spots have not gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> It faded dark spots and smoothed the texture without ever once causing irritation.</li>
            <li> Saw no improvement in the dark spots after finishing two bottles.</li>
            <li> I used the Clinique brand for 6 months with no results; I&#x27;ve used this for one month and my dark spots are already fading (I&#x27;m a 36-yr-old woman who has tanned for years).</li>
            <li> Today is 9/27/14, there is a drastic improvement in the appearance of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost a month now and have not seen any lightening of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dark spots on my face from sun exposure, acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen my dark spots fade dramatically.</li>
            <li> was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Once a month I have a problem with acne which can leave some dark scars on my tan complexion.</li>
            <li> but my skin has improved, both in dark spot correction but</li>
            <li> I can already notice how dark spots have faded.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and this product has truly corrected my dark spots/post acne marks.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any lessening of dark spots and have used for months.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know when it started to work, but at some point I was going through my morning makeup routine and realized that I didn&#x27;t need to use color-correcting concealer on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> But once the blemishes cleared I had dark spots all over my chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> I was uncomfortable being too close to people and looking at them straight on.</li>
            <li> It reduces dark spots, colors, and in some case, improve your skin status</li>
            <li> I did use it on my son though, who went to AZ and got some dark freckles while there.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Did NOT….. make a difference in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal NE Dark Spot Corrector Cream for about three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> It states it minimizes dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for two weeks to get rid of my dark acne spot scars.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 3 weeks for stubborn dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 1 month now, and I may have some lightening of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream is working for me.are substantially lighter, and not as dense.</li>
            <li> Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream is working for me.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HAVE NOTICED AN LIGHTING OF THE DARK SPOTS.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping make the dark spots lighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal Dark Spot corrector for over 2 months and just purchased another bottle, so I won’t run out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have alot of dark spots on my face but did on my hands</li>
            <li> So far not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product because I typically have very sensitive skin to most cosmetics but to my surprise after full use of the bottle all but my worst dark spots are almost completely gone, and my worst ones are faded quite a lot!</li>
            <li> thus the need for using the bottle upside down.</li>
            <li> Just another product let down.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Also dark spots and acne scars are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Also dark spots and acne scars are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin black person</li>
            <li> My overall skin does seem to be a little brighter not so dull looking.</li>
            <li> The dark spot that I don&#x27;t like has noticeably faded, and my entire complexion is subtly brighter.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of treatment, almost all of my dark spots are gone or at least their size reduced.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month and a half of use.</li>
            <li> My skins is a lot less blotchy, I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> i am on the half of the bottle</li>
            <li> My review page said that my review was hidden.  </li>
            <li> Pores also are less noticeable from using this product.</li>
            <li> But I just bought this about a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even half way through this product and my skin is glowing, even, and fading spots.</li>
            <li> The spots are still there but slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> I have used it for less than a week and already see fading of the deeper pigmented spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will say however that this does seem to be toning down the redness a little.</li>
            <li> After few weeks my dark spots were faded for about 70%.</li>
            <li> Maybe the product is only for age spots, and not good for freckles...</li>
            <li> It lighten my dark spots and I could see results within a few months.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, and above my lip, and it has already lightened, and broken up the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, and above my lip, and it has already lightened, and broken up the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have dark areas I want to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I would dab on a little in the morning.</li>
            <li> Never faded even just a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t just minimize my dark spots/sun spots, makes them look like they aren&#x27;t even there!</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely a little tingly.</li>
            <li> It helps with my redness, dark spots and acne scars!</li>
            <li> this is a miracle cream, it takes a little while</li>
            <li> It has dimmed the spots a little.</li>
            <li> It seems like the couple of spots where I have been applying the cream have lightened a little.</li>
            <li> Now that I have used the product for two months I can detect a difference although not significant.  </li>
            <li> I have finished a little over 15% of the cream, and there is a visible lightening.</li>
            <li> Since some of the spots were very dark, I didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
            <li> Since some of the spots were very dark, I didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago along with a few others from the brand</li>
            <li> So, naturally, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> now I find that a replacement is NOT available, just a return.  </li>
            <li> Skin was exfoliated beforehand, sunscreen was used everyday, and the spot corrector was applied in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> waste your money on this &amp;#34;High-Priced Junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen an improvement in my uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using it for a few</li>
            <li> I consider this product a savings when I think of having to pay for laser treatment on my uneven skin tone otherwise.</li>
            <li> I just start this a few days ago and am looking forward to it doing the job everyone says it does.  </li>
            <li> After just a few applications, I noticed a measurable improvement in the evenness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my time and money...took a pic of my face before I started using this Spot Corrector,  </li>
            <li> this product everyday twice a day.</li>
            <li> but truly feel it&#x27;s been a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I began using this product a few weeks ago and have had noticeable improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted $100.00.  </li>
            <li> My skin has had this hyper pigmentation for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I struggle with enlarged pores on my nose, and since using this product they have diffidently minimized.</li>
            <li> it helps a bit I have been using for about 4 weeks &amp; have noticed a slight improvement ..will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, no smell.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly see my dark spots</li>
            <li> Very poor ,has not done anything to my dark spots at all and been using twice daily for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Also it is making break out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream for at least one month now, dutibully applying it twice per day and protecting myself from the sun.  </li>
            <li> I washed  and dried my hands, then applied a small amount of the spot corrector.</li>
            <li> It would get very expensive to use this for much of anything.    </li>
            <li> You need to use the bottle upside down - there is no straw in it (at least both of mine didn&#x27;t have straws)</li>
            <li> Thought it should work since my spots are small and pale to begin with.</li>
            <li> have been issue, after couple weeks of using it we both noticed that the dark spots has been lighter, and I mean 90% lighter.</li>
            <li> Shortly after starting to use it, my face broke out really bad</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I am actually noticing results in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> made my skin look and feel amazing!!It Reduces the appearance of dark spots, age spots, signs of sun damage, and post-acne marks!!</li>
            <li> I do notice a little bit of a glowey dew to my face since using this product!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure that I can test for if the product works to diminish them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for twice a day for the past three weeks.</li>
            <li> Hoping that it would work because it was expensive, and low and behold, it worked!</li>
            <li> I have sun spots and splotchiness from acne in the past, and nothing has worked to lighten them.</li>
            <li> After developing dark spots on my face from prior years in the sun, I was desperate in finding something that would work to fade them.</li>
            <li> Must have if you were a silly sun worshipper back in the day…</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy like others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have freckles (no many)...</li>
            <li> This product was simply waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am well past my prime, into my sixties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product in the past and will continue to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot under my eye, bad enough that people have asked me if I had a black eye, this is seeming to make it not as visible.</li>
            <li> As I said above, the CO2 treatment is both painful and expensive, so I started using the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream that I had ordered from Amazon last winter, on my chest, twice a day, morning, and evening.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than visiting a doctor for treated my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had bad dark spots around my shoulder and chin area prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> It lightened my dark circles under my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> with something purchased from your beauty counter, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> I need at least two to three weeks to decide.</li>
            <li> I know that you can not remove the freckles (because are hereditary), but at least you can reduce the color.</li>
            <li> I have to say at least this product is not working on me.</li>
            <li> It took about at least a month to see a difference, so don&#x27;t fret if you don&#x27;t see any visible improvements.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to report.  </li>
            <li> My face does not feel greasy or thick with lotion.</li>
            <li> I had some acne scars on my cheeks and they&#x27;ve been slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for the past 5+ months and it has literally diminished the look and appearance of ALL of my acne scars!</li>
            <li> so it may just be the nature of my spots rather than a failure on the products part.</li>
            <li> However, I feel there has been a very small improvement in my age spots already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another expensive brand of dark spot corrector for two months with no results.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have dark spots under my eyes...</li>
            <li> That said, this product has produced subtle, but noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Im not impressed at all with this product and definately is not worth the price!</li>
            <li> But they are not kidding when they say use daily and wear sunblock - you can&#x27;t keep doing bad to your skin and think this will miraculously fix everything.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but don&#x27;t mind the price when your trying to get rid of those ugly dark marks on your face!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even have extreme damage to go off, just annoying dark spots I&#x27;d like to fade to keep my complexion even and healthy-looking.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the results, especially after rave reviews given by others..  </li>
            <li> I did research as i didn&#x27;t not want to use dangerous bleaching creams like hydroquinone to fade the dark spots.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to dedicate the time and consistency to using this product you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very slowly..</li>
            <li> the spots on my face became worse .</li>
            <li> After a week, the spotting started fading and eventually went away after approximately six weeks.</li>
            <li> On an olive skinned person, that is not attractive.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of using makeup to cover them up</li>
            <li> the pump on my bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> Also non irritating.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to say the least, but bought this with my holiday gift card just to see if it could work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever expect dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I know it will take a while to see dramatic results concerning the diminishment of my acne scars</li>
            <li> This has smoothed out the scar I&#x27;ve had on my head since I was a little girl,  from a bad wreck.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and see if it could get rid of all of my dark marks that I absolutely hate and I have been using it a month</li>
            <li> Therefore it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but you get alot and don&#x27;t need to use alot, so it works out.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my winter was hectic</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they are fake?  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s a bit expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of fading spots on my face from unfortunate blemish scars.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for my skin either.  </li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I tried obagi for 6 months and saw no results, my skin peeled like crazy, my face looked worse than ever and it gave me acne.</li>
            <li> I use 55 SPF as my moisturizer and I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but the bottle size is generous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s expensive...</li>
            <li> I saw some reviewers said those 5 star reviews are fake, but  I just wanted to try out.</li>
            <li> I now post mine because I want people to save their money and avoid those fake 5 stars review, those reviews just like a scam.</li>
            <li> but it also is not damaging like hydroquinone or other nasty chemicals to bleach your face with.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to say the least!</li>
            <li> I have very bad acne scars all over my face and plenty of dark spots that made me look sickly.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a product to improve the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing purchasing this product  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointing, considering the price.</li>
            <li> It was painful and expensive, but it worked.</li>
            <li> Because it is quite expensive, I am still thinking if I want to buy it again!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to skin care products.</li>
            <li> it had either gone bad, or was counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Granted, my spots were not fully darkened but that is because I didn’t allow them to get that bad.</li>
            <li> It is really bad.  </li>
            <li> I would get painful cystic spots monthly, this month, nothing.  </li>
            <li> , I am shocked this is working.</li>
            <li> I became a bit frustrated because I didn&#x27;t see improvements for about a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have just used 2 days on my face and my neck, my face have broken out terribly as well as my neck.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed, of course.</li>
            <li> I bought this because if the reviews, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed....</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed and ripped off.</li>
            <li> Bad investment!</li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>
            <li> very disappointed for the price.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This product feels very nice on my face, absorbs fast and not greasy or thick. It balances the fine line between effective but not wreaking your skin to achieve results. My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even. It&#x27;s lightweight and 2 pumps covers the face. I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li> works great on the skin, I saw a big difference in months.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a dermatologist who told me there was nothing I could do for the spots on my face, I am 42 and the dark spots were too deep. I love Vernal products so decided to give it a try. Too my utter shock it worked! The spots are barely noticeable after 4 weeks. They are not gone but so much lighter. It takes time, but it is definitely worth it. Would recommend. The bottle lasts a while too, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month and a half of use. 2 times a day and with a daily sunscreen. I really like how the cream makes my skin feel and I have seen improvement in texture and look of my skin BUT I really have not seen much of a difference in my dark spots.I have some discoloration from the sun and a medication that made my skin sensitive to the sun and created some blotchy areas a few years ago. I have tried so many spot corrector products and none seem to make that much of a difference so it may just be the nature of my spots rather than a failure on the products part. But I love the way my skin feels and looks so much from this cream that I would actually purchase again for use as a really incredible daily moisturizer. And who knows, maybe with longer term use I will see more of an improvement on the spot situation.</li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended with absolutely no change in my dark sport...very disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;For the money I really expected some results...nothing...&lt;br /&gt;It was creamy and no heavy perfume smell which is a big plus...</li>
            <li> As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this Vernal N-E Dark spot corrector cream in the mail!!!! After testing this Dark spot corrector cream  out for my self I have to say this Dark spot corrector cream is way better then ones  I have tried in the past!!!This dark spot corrector cream made my skin look and feel amazing!!It Reduces the appearance of dark spots, age spots, signs of sun damage, and post-acne marks!! It protects against future age spot development with a balanced composition of stabilized vitamin C, &amp; Zinc PCA.This Vernal N-E Dark Spot corrector cream helps brighten &amp; even out skin tone and promotes long-term radiance revealing a more radiant glow!! Its also formulated with Diacetyl Boldine and Pro-Cysteine, dark spots on the skins surface begin to fade and encourages new cell growth &amp; consumer Trials found: In 88% of users saw fewer dark spots in just 8 weeks!!  I definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Awesome one I have ever used.I started using it.hope it gives good results after continued usage.i ordered this product in exchange of reviews</li>
            <li> I am actually reviewing this on my scar,  not really an age spot treatment. This has smoothed out the scar I&#x27;ve had on my head since I was a little girl,  from a bad wreck.  I&#x27;ve used countless of other things and never worked and this seems to be the key to working.  I really like how it just smooths out everything on my skin.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for close to two weeks now, what can I say? It&#x27;s truly a wonderful product. Unlike other spot correctors I&#x27;ve used in this past this product has actually delivered. It&#x27;s reduced the appearance of most of blemishes I&#x27;ve had and my skin complexion is starting to look more radiant and even. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really did brighten my face and diminish my leftover acne spots quite a bit, but not completely. My dermatologist said he could write me an Rx for the same ingredient used in this product, but stronger. This is a great over the counter product, though. However, when I purchased it the second time around, the product was darker in color and not the same texture as the first bottle. I sent it back to the seller-- it had either gone bad, or was counterfeit.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. That sums it up! But wow I was so excited to start using it when it came in my mail and the shipping wasn&#x27;t an issue either. I have dark areas I want to get rid of! Don&#x27;t we all!! Well I focused on applying this product two times a day, morning and night, on my neck. Yes, it is a little dark on the back of my neck so I wanted to put this product to the test and BAM in just 2-3 days I already seen very visible and very comparable results! I love this product and I love the fact that the cream pumps out of the bottle. It&#x27;s makes things more fun :) I like the products appearance and what it did for me so I&#x27;m very happy I got this product and I&#x27;ll be getting more when this runs out!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this product really worked, I had two very large dark/age spots (size of a dime) on my face that got even darker due to going to Hawaii and being out in the sun so much. I used this every night before I went to bed and within a month both spots had nearly faded. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks not  seeing any improvement. Also it is making break out pretty bad. Plus now I&#x27;m stick with a bottle I can&#x27;t use cause dummy me waited one day too long to return it.</li>
            <li> This product is light, fragrance free and feels nice on my face.  I did notice after about two weeks my skin is much brighter and even skin tone. Very  pleased with the results.  I received the product free in return for my review.  I highly recommend for brighter skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for since received and noticed a bit change on my discoloration on my face and back from acne. I also asked my mom to use the product, shes 60 and her sunspot are also gone.....</li>
            <li> So far, it is working great.  Already notice an improvement in about a week or so.</li>
            <li> One star because the pumps on both the bottles I got do not work. Broke it open. After two months no change in brown spots</li>
            <li> great for lightning spots.</li>
            <li> thie is a very nice spot corrector product, been using it for a week or two and I can see my spots now is lightening.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference and it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks. Fine lines and dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> It really works! However, you have to be consistent, and applied it twice a day. My skin is much more even now, and the dark spots are significantly fading. I tried before even more expensive products like Clinique, Lancome, and Estee Lauder, and they never even came close to the results I have with Vernal. I Highly recommended. Of course, do not forget increase your sunblock protection, too.</li>
            <li> Good, but too small, it only lasts one week.  Therefore it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product worked so perfectly I wanted to provide an endorsement. I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy specialty products like this, but had an age/sun spot on my upper check for several years that bothered me. I took a chance after reading other reviews, and after about 4-6 weeks of using this product my spot is COMPLETELY gone, not faded, gone. I would dab on a little in the morning. sometimes at night if I thought about it, and it took care of my spot, which has also not come back and I stopped using the product several months ago. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on the back of both my right an left hands. The ones on my left had were darker and more numerous then the ones on my right. I have been using this product for two weeks now. All the spots on my right hand are practically invisible. The ones on my left hand are about 70 percent lighter. This product seems to be working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am only 27 and the idea of buying a 50 dollar treatment was kind of crazy. Nothing SUPER magical happened but after almost 1 month of using this every day, my skin is smoother, clearer, and my acne scars are definitely lightened. My skins is a lot less blotchy, I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and I am thrilled with the results with Vernal.  The dark spots are so light and my skin tone has evened out.  Thank you for helping a slightly older woman like what she sees in the mirror.</li>
            <li> When I use this faithfully I see a really big difference in my complection. Since I have acne I mix it with my acne face cream and apply them together. It not only makes my dark spots and acne marks fade quickly I think my skin in general looks brighter. The product itself is so silky. I love putting it on. I have oily skin but since I put it on w my acne cream (not a prescription) my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily. I use it at night. This is a product I find is worth the money and it lasts a long time. I highly recommend this product. :) Oh, I also have very sensitive skin and have had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because I would like to prevent future dark skin spots on my face. The cream goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling moisturized. I like this cream because it does not have a strong smell. I do not currently have dark spots so I am not sure that I can test for if the product works to diminish them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the expensive big box store products for dark spots but this product is just as good!  I saw a difference in my skin tone after 4 weeks and the tube lasted me over a month and a week. I have some sun damage and brown spots so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot but this did a good job.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I used this religiously twice a day for as long the bottle lasted with absolutely no improvement in the dark spots on my facial skin. Absolute waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and so far all I&#x27;ve noticed is it makes my skin very oily!  I have oily skin anyway, and this has increased oil production substantially.  I have yet to notice any difference in dark spots.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll start seeing results within the week if you use it religiously ;) While using this I was pairing it with other Vitamin C products. I think the collagen booster and this work really well together. I recommend this to those who have oily skin simply because it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky/more oily. I would love to get it more often if it weren&#x27;t so dang pricey. Besides that, it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Bottle is pretty, but its too soon to tell if it works. This product takes several weeks of use before you can see the results. Since I just started using, I can&#x27;t provide an adequate review for awhile. Amazon should send me another request for product review in about a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has been using another well known product for years and he said he liked this one better. It sinks right into your skin and is not greasy. It&#x27;s too early to tell the results but he has high hopes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago along with a few others from the brand and I have applied it on my acne scars, red spots daily- AM/PM under my moisturizer. It has a light and dries fairly quickly into your skin. I have noticed a huge difference, most of my scars are faded and I have a clearer skin tone. And the best part is even my fiance commented on how my skin is improving! I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Finally, after two times a day of 46 days&#x27; religiously using, it only accomplished a little result of which I thought it might at least erases freckles on my cheeks.  Because it is quite expensive, I am still thinking if I want to buy it again!</li>
            <li> Does not work as claimed. very disappointed for the price. I feel duped!</li>
            <li> I received a weeks worth of samples from my friend and instantly loved it. This stuff right here is gold .The creme is for dark spots and also has a matte affect (which is always a plus)for my oily skin .The creme reduced the size of my age spots. I noticed a difference in about four weeks. Great product.</li>
            <li> Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream works.  The dark spots on my face is definitely getting lighter and and the product is very gentle and does not irritate my skin. I highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to be a tanning bed fanatic, and now - I have a face full of brown spots and blemishes. So, after trying the Murad &amp; Philosophy dark spot correctors with little success, I ordered the Vernal NE spot corrector product out of desperation. I have for the last month been dabbing it on my 10-12 facial brown spots with twice a day (still on original bottle). They are finally starting to fade! I have had no irritation and no reaction to product. But my skin looks great, and in another few months - I think I may have lightened these spots to the point of not having to use full coverage makeup at all times. I know 49 bucks seems steep, but you can&#x27;t put a price on feeling great about yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Non-greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks.  I&#x27;ve noticed some fading of my dark spots and will continue using twice a day in hopes of seeing more positive results.</li>
            <li> Excellent! It actually took away a decent size sunspot I had on my neck. I bought this product in order to put it underneath my moisturizer. My skin indeed looked flawless after using it. This is definitely worth buying. I have been using this serum for twice a day for the past three weeks. Be patient and results will come!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i am on the half of the bottle and i havent noticed much, i will have to wait until i finished to see is gonna be worth the money or not.</li>
            <li> I put the dark spot corrector cream on and let it dry, later I looked at my leg where I applied the cream and it looked I had bruising on my leg.  The cream had turned a blue-purple color on my leg which at first startled me thinking I had hit my leg and then realized it is the product that can be wiped off.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, this is my second Order. Leaves my skin blemish free and ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> Used it for definitely over 1-3 months. Didn&#x27;t really see any significant results. I use it here and there now.</li>
            <li> too much time involved for a working gal to focus on this item</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading reviews but after using daily til the bottle ran out, can honestly say there is no lightening of my few subtle dark spots. Thought it should work since my spots are small and pale to begin with. Maybe works for non-Asian skin?</li>
            <li> the spots on my face became worse .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ratr it 5/5 because I jusy started it. Idk how long its supposed to take to show results.</li>
            <li> I have been using product as directed for 1 week. I have definitely seen improvement in the dark spots on my face. I am 50 yrs old and had started seeing &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;. I used some cheaper stuff from convenience stores that did nothing. So, naturally, I was skeptical. Read the reviews and decided, alright this is it, one more. Hoping that it would work because it was expensive, and low and behold, it worked! It is expensive but you get alot and don&#x27;t need to use alot, so it works out. My face does not feel greasy or thick with lotion. My husband and brother are now using it also. Next, we tackle the bags under our eyes! Keep you posted.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to scar easily, especially from acne. I have tried product after product to reduce the blemishes on my face and neck, and have not had much luck. Finally, I purchased this after reading reviews, and I must say- the reviews hold up. After applying this cream twice a day for two weeks, I have noticed a significant lightening of the dark spots where I have had acne scars for months. This is the product I&#x27;ve been waiting for all along.</li>
            <li> Only been a week, but starting to notice a real difference! Highly recommend this produce</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer: I really needed more time to review this, but the website I&#x27;m suppose to write this review for wants it now. For the record, my opinion would not have changed if I had to paid for this item, this is how I truly feel. I used the item for 2 weeks, but it says you need 4 to see real improvements**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dark and I suffer from hyperpigmentation  from post acne issues. The best I&#x27;ve used was hydroquinin 4%, but I can only use it for 2 months before having to switch. When I decided to try this product I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the best results because it would need more time than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself feels light and creamy. A great plus is that it didn&#x27;t break me out ( I break out from anything). I saw a little difference in my skin, but nothing super dramatic. I believe that it will help clear your skin up after 6 weeks or a longer amount of time. I will continue to use the product and post updates.</li>
            <li> I have had this just a short time but noticed a lovely glowing skin feel and appearance. It is too soon to see any reduction is dark spots but hoping to see it&#x27;s affects in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> using for a month now and i have not noticed any difference at all, will keep using until its gone</li>
            <li> The corrector cream helped with many of the dark spots on my face. I applied it as a spot corrector prior to serum and have notice my blemishes lightening throughout the month. The small amount needed makes the product last for MONTHS!</li>
            <li> The pump action on this has no means to convey product to the nozzle and now I find that a replacement is NOT available, just a return.  This is NOT satisfactory as far as I&#x27;m concerned when the damage/faultiness was NOT of my doing.</li>
            <li> Really good quality cream!  Helps dard spots on skin and hands.  Feels nice on skin and not greasy like so many other creams/oils &amp; lotions. Plus many other comparable products are only 1 oz but this is 2oz, always great when you are able to get double amount of product!  Received discounted price however did not affect review or what I thought of this.</li>
            <li> This product took only two months to completely rid me of my dark spots! I have noticed better results with this product in a shorter period of time than other products. I applied this product religiously every single day twice a day for those two months and I believe that my amazing results are in part due to that along with this just being a great product. I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are someone who is dedicated to the cause of ridding yourself of dark spots!</li>
            <li> Smooth to apply.  Looking forward to seeing a difference in my acne scars.I hope to see spots lighten soon!</li>
            <li> I have been using a month now.  I have noticed a difference.  I will keep using and reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star review for the time being--I&#x27;ve been religiously using this product for just over a week and so far no results in terms of fading age spots.  It gets the 3 stars because it does make my skin feel different, in a positive way, as if it&#x27;s retaining moisture better.  Will have to wait and see (a month?) if this products actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Purchased as test product. Will update on results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just starting using the product and don&#x27;t see results yet. I keep getting emails to review.</li>
            <li> First of all - I can&#x27;t really review this for age/brown spot removal as that is not my issue.  I have areas of reddish discoloration and have had regular problems with acne, which would leave lingering red spots.  First of all, this has done wonders for my skin texture and helping with skin turnover.  I tended to get flakiness and dryness with most acne product.  First of all, I have had NO real breakouts since starting to use this twice a day.  I would get painful cystic spots monthly, this month, nothing.  Comedones are much reduced, almost completely eliminated.  I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using for 4 weeks at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second this is truly gentle.  I have very sensitive skin, and this goes on like a dream.  Small amount of warmth on first applying, then leaves skin moisturized and calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall complexion is much  more even, and holds onto moisture much better as a result of it&#x27;s healthier state.  I&#x27;ve been able to almost eliminate moisturizing (which is good for me, as after trying multiple moisturizers, even the ones that worked best seemed to increase breakouts.) I&#x27;ve finally broken free of the moisturizer makes me break out/acne treatment make my skin dry and flake cycle.  I&#x27;m not a pricey beauty product person, but I&#x27;m impressed enough with the results that I&#x27;ve bought a second bottle while still only part way through the first one.  Right now I&#x27;m using only this and roc facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not yet ready to go completely coverup-foundation free for work for example but my bareface complexion is now almost as good as I could previously get with light bb cream coverage.  Now I can just use spot concealer for work to even out a bit and am good to go.  Hope the redness reducing will continue, but even if it just maintains this level and the wonderful clearness and texture of my skin, this is 100% win.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last winter with EVERY intent on using it. Needless to say, my winter was hectic so I didn&#x27;t use it like i should have. fast forward to February of this year. My skin issues are dullness, blemishes, some hyper-pigmentation and blotchiness. I use it 2x a day AM and PM. Not to exaggerate but on the second week, my skin was noticeably smoother, the blotchiness was gone.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these bottles and by the second bottle, only a few spots were gone. I guess I bought it with very high expectations. Skin was exfoliated beforehand, sunscreen was used everyday, and the spot corrector was applied in the morning and at night. Guess everyone is different. I will say however that this does seem to be toning down the redness a little. Will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spot corrector for only 2 WEEKS - and I already love it! My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!). I&#x27;ve already seen my dark spots fade dramatically. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Twice a day after I wash my body and face with a microderm cleanser. I apply a little on each spot (which is a lot) and rub it in in the general area. The pump packaging is much more sanitary. The Proactiv Spot Corrector didn&#x27;t have immediate or much noticeable results, but this has been working very good so far. It protects and helps even my skin, I bought this a three week ago and I&#x27;ve seen some changes on the places I applied the product to.  In my opinion it smells kinda &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and kinda flowerish, but scent disappears after application and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This product does work. Do make sure you wear sunscreen just sat the product says.</li>
            <li> This is a staple of my morning routine, I easily look 5 years younger. It leaves my skin feeling like silk and looking soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working after one week and it&#x27;s realy good but when I am using the acne come out on my face so that&#x27;s not good but I amstill using my dark spot will be gone after 3 week</li>
            <li> I have sun spots and have tried everything. This product is nice on the skin, light and soft and did wonders on clearing my skin of sun spots and also brighten some dark spots I&#x27;ve had for years. I use this product twice a day and my face hasn&#x27;t broke out once so I&#x27;m really happy about that. I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my skin, and it&#x27;s most definitely worth a try. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but don&#x27;t mind the price when your trying to get rid of those ugly dark marks on your face! you have nothing to lose but those unattractive marks! I also use this in conjunction with the Vernal serum.</li>
            <li> I take religiously good care of my skin as a consultant, but am very fair and acne prone with some blotchiness. I have had acne scars lingering for years. Within 5 weeks the majority are gone!!! I can definitely see an improvement in my scars. I also love the way this product has brightened up and evened out my skin tone, and when I put it on it makes my face feel super soft.&lt;br /&gt;Naysayers, use a sunscreen, it won&#x27;t get rid of freckles you are born with, and give it more than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots that are either that or freckles. I also have acne scars since I scar fairly easily. I&#x27;ve been using this religiously &amp; I even took a picture before I started. No lightening or reduction. I took another picture in the same lighting &amp; it looks the same. I wish there was a money back guarantee thingy because this would go back for sure. I am a verified buyer &amp; I say, this product did NOT help me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks every night but have so far since no results at all. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it in the hope that a dark spot on my face is lightened.</li>
            <li> Patience is well worth it with this cream! I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed. I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience. I will say what I like about this cream is that you can see the difference and it gives a healthy glow to your skin. Also dark spots and acne scars are a lot less noticeable. People noticed and told me... It wasn&#x27;t just me. It works better than those other expensive serums out there!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since I was a teenager and have scars around my mouth and chin from those deep, deep zits you get around a certain time of the month. After two weeks, I could see my scars begin to fade. After four weeks, there are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for my dark spots which were caused by the sun. My dark spots are starting to lighten after a week :). I got this for a review but it is my opinion.</li>
            <li> I gave this only 4 stars because I only have this about 2 weeks. However, I feel there has been a very small improvement in my age spots already. I only use it once a day but it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a month. It seems&lt;br /&gt;to help on light colored age spots but not effective on larger,&lt;br /&gt;darker ones. It&#x27;s price to effectiveness &#x27;ratio&#x27; is too high.&lt;br /&gt;I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> After having thyroid cancer and my hormones out of whack, I began developing this horrid large brown spots on my face - the most troublesome was the dark spots that looked like a mustache. I purchased the Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream at a great discount in hopes that this was the last product that I would have to purchase since I have tried everything to no avail.  I am happy to report after a week of use the dark spots on my face are beginning to fade and I couldn&#x27;t be more ecstatic!  I am so thankful that I stumbled upon this miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have not noticed any change whatsoever.  Not even on the lightest of spots.  I am really disappointed in this product.  I even used it twice a day with sunscreen and still nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have acne prone skin and get a dark spot after every breakout. This product has removed those spots within days after application. Also I already notice a difference in minor sun spots, and an overall smoothness to my skin tone. This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup. Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve used this for one week and can already tell a difference.  I recommend this product!  Just wanted to add an update.  After three weeks I can tell a big difference in the reduction of redness and dark spots.  Skin texture has also improved.  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I had recently got my first sun spot and so I chose this after a bit of research I put it on twice a day for two weeks and sun spots are gone. I also started using this on some acne scars I want to get rid off and so far they have faded very little but I&#x27;m hoping they will eventually be gone using this daily. Not expecting a miracle but I like the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far. I will say what I mainly noticed is that treating the spots as they appear has a higher success rate than treating those that are a couple of years old. I recommend this product based on the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the bottle I received was defective because I had to break it open to get any out. Cut my hand. Not happy!</li>
            <li> This cream is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far. It is pricey for my taste; however, well worth it. What I love about this cream is that after a week of use you can see the difference. I noticed the age spots on my hands and shoulders start to fade. Since some of the spots were very dark, I didn&#x27;t think it would work. People noticed and told me... It wasn&#x27;t just me. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> No difference noted after using product twice daily for one month.  Vernal N-E It&#x27;s nothing more than expensive hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself. I&#x27;ve read many many many reviews, and it seems to me that you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it. I think that it really depends on the type of marks you seek to reduce. Because mine were relatively recent (last fall), superficial acne scars that were likely to fade anyway, this product has really helped to speed along the process. After only a few weeks of treatment, almost all of my dark spots are gone or at least their size reduced. Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I had bad dark spots around my shoulder and chin area prior to using this product. This stuff is great. It faded those dark marks by 95% in about 5 weeks. Given more time, I hope that this product will resolve most of the issues I have with the discoloration as I have noticed some change, but it has been only a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product morning and evening on cheeks and forehead. I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin. Patience with this cream is worth it! I bought this a month ago and started using it at night after cleansing my face. You don&#x27;t get overnight results but it also is not damaging like hydroquinone or other nasty chemicals to bleach your face with. I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use I will see some difference in the sun spots since it&#x27;s pretty expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 yr. old with light complexion and tried this product for 4 weeks. The results have been very good so far. Acne marks and dark spots have decreased significantly. It really helps smooth out uneven skin due to pores. From other comments I read, people were complaining how if they knew there was less product they would&#x27;ve used it sparingly; however, because of the price, I only used it as a spot treatment, and it lasted me a good amount of time. As for me I will buy again. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face as directed for over 6 weeks and so absolutely no sign of the dark spots lightening.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I usually wait until I&#x27;ve used a product for 2+ weeks before I write a review, but this one really delivered. It does diminish / lightens any dark/ sun spots. I have a lot on my face but after using this I find that my spots are getting smaller and some have lightened dramatically. Now, the results aren&#x27;t instant It was after gradual use for me that I found results after 2-3 weeks of using it twice a day (morning &amp; night) I will continue to use this product highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is just ok. After few weeks my dark spots were faded for about 70%. With this price I would expect to see more result. I don&#x27;t think I would want to buy this product again after I have finish it.</li>
            <li> A lot of the positive reviews in here are not &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; reviews.  I wonder if they are fake?  Most of the verified reviews are negative.  I have been using this product twice daily for about a week (no results yet).  I will update this review in about a month.  Update 2016: I used the lotion as directed and it did nothing.  I do see that more of the reviews are &amp;#34;verified&amp;#34; which I hope means they are authentic.  My review page said that my review was hidden.  Why would my honest review be hidden.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe acne scars from teen acne, and this product is actually fading them. I have tried many other things and this actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried it for three weeks and it seems to be working very well. I plan on  to use the continuing product</li>
            <li> I saw a review of products like this that were compared for effect and ingredients.  This was one of the top rated, effective, and affordable.  I am not perfect about using it as much as they say, but I can notice the dark age-spots are lighter (not my imagination), and the lines are a little softer and not so deep.  Not a miracle, but a pretty good effect for less cost and hassle than a medical office treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another expensive brand of dark spot corrector for two months with no results.  I recently recieved this to try and already like the results.  I hope to see even betterr results in a month!  Its creamy format makes it easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have an awful medicine smell which I love.  This is definitely a keep!  I lefft one star off until I update my review in a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Corrector for a month now, and my sun damage and age spots are noticeably diminished. I also had a couple dark spots in the back of my hand I wanted to lighten up and it works like a charm. My skin looked more clear than it normally does. Love it!</li>
            <li> Hmmm... Ive used whole bottle didn&#x27;t see any big results.</li>
            <li> It worked for me it&#x27;s a month today since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my spot has lighten a lot. I wish it wasn&#x27;t almost $50 a bottle because I sure need another bottle! Just try it!</li>
            <li> I love it . Would definitely recommend it and will reorder this product .</li>
            <li> This product is over-priced for what it is. It did not work for me and I&#x27;m close to being done with the bottle. I&#x27;d recommend Proactiv&#x27;s dark spot corrector over it. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a period of great skin distress in order to even out the dark spots which were left over.This product is better than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried and believe me when I say I have spent more money on products that do not work. I have fair skin and living in Hawaii is hard for me to not go in the sun so, I do not leave the house without my sunscreen. I figured to try this product out and I have noticed in 4-5 weeks time my dark spots and freckles have diminished and my skin has an even tone to it. I am happy about my purchase and I will continue to use it faithfully. For best results to those who say it doesn&#x27;t work for you have to wear SPF sunscreen or you&#x27;re defeating the purpose of it and your spots will come back.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me personally. #wasteofmoney</li>
            <li> this product worked well for me.  Took about 3 to 4 weeks to notice a difference in the spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Ordering was quick &amp; easy ... received order quickly, but the product is not worth the price.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice/day for over 2 weeks &amp; can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference.  This product is just like the dozen others I&#x27;ve tried ... a bunch of hype &amp; way over-priced!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try something different and it had good reviews. I have noticed no difference in my skin and my dark spots have not gotten lighter. It may have worked for others but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it really has made a difference! I had some acne scars on my cheeks and they&#x27;ve been slowly fading away. I&#x27;ve also noticed It really helps to perfect blemished skin, and reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> Look, I&#x27;ve tried all of the high-market dark spot correctors from Clinique  all across the spectrum.  None helped remove dark spots from my forehead.  But this Vernal stuff lessens the darkness.  I&#x27;m gonna buy some more and see where it goes.</li>
            <li> I use this product both morning and at night. This product works so well! I have acne prone akin and get a dark spot after every breakout. This cleared my acne, along with other Vernal products, and got rid of my dark spots within weeks. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 months saw no improvement in age or acne spots. Have used another cream that did show results.</li>
            <li> Amazon showed this as Top Ranked.&lt;br /&gt;It is poor quality at best.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money on this &amp;#34;High-Priced Junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I saw improvements in the sun spots I had around my shoulders for not properly applying sun-screen. It is a sigh of relief especially since I&#x27;ve bought many products that claim to fade sun spots but none worked as well as Vernal. I came across this product while searching on Google. I now tell all my friends that like to spend time out on the sun to keep this product in their cabinet!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product actually works. I have some dark spots on old scarring on my face which has lightened up. They were old very superficial. It seems to cause a gentle peeling.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.</li>
            <li> really, really does fade sun spots!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream for at least one month now, dutibully applying it twice per day and protecting myself from the sun.  Early on, by means of wishful thinking, I had myself convinced that the sunspots on my face were fading.  Then doubt arose and I took some close-up pictures of my face and have been tracking.  No change.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for 6 weeks, using sunscreen daily as always, and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on any of the spots I had taken photos of. Was disappointed, of course. I&#x27;ll have to go for something like Intense Pulse Light I guess. I was hoping to do it cheaper. Bummer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I use it twice a day, and see no difference.</li>
            <li> Just had it for week and I can tell already, the dark spots are fading. I use it twice each day once in the morning and once at bed time.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and thick and a little goes a long way.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how large the bottle is; it will last a good long while.  I slide it on right after showering and it is creamy enough to serve as a pretty nice moisturizer.  I will update this review once I see whether the dark spots are lightening considerably.</li>
            <li> This product has dramatically reduced the discoloration on my face within 3 weeks. I have sun spots and splotchiness from acne in the past, and nothing has worked to lighten them. I desperately needed a product to improve the appearance of my skin so I no longer had to pile on the makeup. After only three weeks of using this the sunspots are much lighter and the old acne scarring is significantly less noticeable. My skin looks brighter and more even. I am starting to like my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best skin care product I have tried to treat dark spots and discoloration and it is very easy to use. I apply before I go to work along with a moisturizer with SPF and at night before I go to bed and the results get better and better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 8 days since I&#x27;ve purchased this product and already, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive improvement in my overall skin tone. I have light olive skin that has acne scars and after using it exactly as directed, my skin tone is looking more even and my pores are looking smaller as well. I use this twice a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look. I gave it five stars so that people who can afford it know to buy it. Its worth it if you have the income.</li>
            <li> its ok... meaning from  this moment, I don&#x27;t know what to say, cause  I didn&#x27;t see a sign of a good result of my face.</li>
            <li> After developing dark spots on my face from prior years in the sun, I was desperate in finding something that would work to fade them. I tried a few products before trying out the Vernal NE spot corrector and to my surprised this product worked out great. I did use religiously morning and night and I saw results within the first week. I would and have recommended this product to several friends, family and co-workers who all loved it as well. Must have if you were a silly sun worshipper back in the day…</li>
            <li> very satisfied with cream. I was skeptical when I purchased. It said it would rid You of any dark spots well it worked great for me. Like what it looks like I can just leave on my dresser Don&#x27;t have to hide it. Price was reasonable and received right away.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast and arrived perfectly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I have seen some improvement already but because it&#x27;s early it&#x27;s not a lot. I use at night, after I shower and in the mornings. I love how fast it dries and is not oily at all. The only frustration is how the pump from the bottle doesn&#x27;t work at time. I also received a discount from Snagshout and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results. I purchased this to help with the appearance of acne scars. The packaging indicates that results can be noticed after a month of use. It hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet and I am already seeing significant improvement. I will continue to use this product and I know things will continue to improve. One squirt treats the effected areas on my face as well as a scar I have on my arm from a bug bite. Since you only need so little, the bottle lasts a long time. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I use this product twice a day and used sunscreen. Nothing happened. My dark spots still there.  Never faded even just a little bit. It&#x27;s disappointing purchasing this product  because it&#x27;s a bit expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work but I will continue using this until I ran out and hopefully I&#x27;ll come back for a better review.</li>
            <li> I used to tan in a booth ALOT! Being younger I didn&#x27;t even care about dark spots but now I have them. This product does what it says it says. This product doesn&#x27;t just minimize my dark spots/sun spots, makes them look like they aren&#x27;t even there! I&#x27;ve also seen an improvement in my uneven complexion. It works well, and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying it. I just don&#x27;t like the price tag. This is definitely a splurge item. But it&#x27;s in my top five favorite anti aging products.</li>
            <li> Have been using twice a day for 2 weeks now for dark spots and achne blemishes. I haven&#x27;t noticed results so far and don&#x27;t think will get now. Three stars for getting it for discounted price and moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. This is the only product I have found that actually fades age spots. After using it for only three weeks, the age spots on the backs of my 50 plus year old hands are smaller and faded! The small freckles I have had all my adult life are completely gone. The texture of this product is perfect and there is none of the coffee house aroma I associate with skin lightening products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It goes on smooth and helps moisturize my skin, although I have very oily skin its not over thick or moisturizing. It has lightened up my sun spots on my forehead but also has helped with my acne because of the willow bark extract. I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to assess, but I do love the cool, moisturizing feel.  I am trying it out on an age spot on my husband&#x27;s face, and he is actually letting me.  I will keep using it daily, and expect to see some results down the road.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the results, especially after rave reviews given by others..  However, I was using on my hands.  I realize that although I use care when frequently washing my hands not to get the tops of my hands wet (and remove the product) that this may have been the case, resulting in product not performing very well.  I did see some minimal fading after a month&#x27;s use (in which time I used the entire bottle).  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.Still have dark Spots on my hands</li>
            <li> I waited to review this item so I could get a good feel if this works. I use it for redness and scarring on my face and it has helped lighten it tremendously. My mom has started using it for liver spots on her hands and they are actually lightening a bit. Very happy with this serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal Skin Corrector for over a month and just purchased another bottle, so I wo&#x27;t run out. This cream isn&#x27;t magically perfect, it doesn&#x27;t work quickly and it&#x27;s no miracle, but unlike other dark spot correctors I have tried, this Vernal Cream EALLY does work. It may take a few weeks to notice any changes and a few months to notice more dramatic changes, but you will notice a gradual fading of dark spots. Several years ago I had a few laser treatments which provided very quick results. I believe that the results fom the Vernal spot corrector are just as good, one just has to be patient. I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling iron burn marks fade dramatically.</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce dark spots.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of fading spots on my face from unfortunate blemish scars. I also have freckles but of course I knew this product wouldn&#x27;t get rid of those. I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in things like this normally. It&#x27;s a bit extreme to claim that you can visibly reduce dark spots, etc. with something purchased from your beauty counter, at least in my experience. And I don&#x27;t even have extreme damage to go off, just annoying dark spots I&#x27;d like to fade to keep my complexion even and healthy-looking. So I was not expecting much when I tried this out. But really, this serum is amazing. It goes on silky-smooth and actually does what it claims to without feeling harsh or strong . I&#x27;m so glad they sell a large size. I can&#x27;t say enough about this and would especially recommend it to those with super-fair skin like me. </li>
            <li> Goes on nicely a little tingly. Haven&#x27;t really noticed a major change on the noticeable dark spots. My overall skin does seem to be a little brighter not so dull looking. I believe with continued use the darker spots will fade. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is amazing I used it for a few weeks it I can hardly see my dark spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now and my dark spots are almost completely faded! I suffered from severe acne marks and before I started using this I could never go out without makeup. Now my skin looks more clear and beautiful! Without a doubt it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Had three spots on my face and after using this product I can barely see them anymore. Very happy and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have use Vernal spot corrector product twice a day and after 4 week I noticed a visible difference in my skin. My sun/age spots have faded and my skin looks brighter and more even toned. The product itself absorb into my skin quickly and the 2oz bottle really goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost two months now. Although some of my spots have not completely faded, I would recommend this product just on the improvement I have seen alone and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t help me at all. I was expecting better quality for this price but it was waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing amazing results, but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.  After all, it does say &amp;#34;clinically proven&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to diminish sunspots on my forehead and cheekbones after a trip to Aruba. After a week, the spotting started fading and eventually went away after approximately six weeks. You must regularly apply it day and night--and give it time--but it does work. Well worth the cost because I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brighteners and dark spot correctors and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out. It also clears up my skin, I get fewer breakouts when I use it</li>
            <li> I got this to for my spouse since sun spots and age spots have been issue, after couple weeks of using it we both noticed that the dark spots has been lighter, and I mean 90% lighter. The visible improvement is a confirmation that we have made the right purchase. It&#x27;s a good product and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but this stuff actually works. It faded the freckles on my cheekbones and dark spots near the corners of my eyes. It lightened coloration around the corners of my mouth. This was after a month of using daily. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my face, and this product seems to be helping to make them lighter. This is the best product I have ever tried for my dark spots...</li>
            <li> This is my first serum corrector that I&#x27;ve tried. The main reason that I splurged on it was because of all the brilliant reviews about how it works wonders on lightening acne scars. I also loved the packaging which I thought was very chic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin with yellow undertones. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now; a couple of days ago I was looking in the mirror and realized that my acne scars are really much better and some are non-existent. As I said, I have been using this serum for twice a day for the last three weeks. Be patient and results will come!</li>
            <li> I have seen a complete difference in my old acne scars and dark spots! I would recommend anyone to try this! I swear by it! I will be buying it again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;-very please customer 😊👍</li>
            <li> I have been using it of couple of days and I love it. It&#x27;s not greasy like others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, no smell.  However, it broke my face out like I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it some time to see if maybe it was a fluke, or if there was another cause, and product still did the same thing.  Disappointed because it got good ratings.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see how this item works. It is fragrance free and sinks into the skin quickly and is not greasy in the slightest way! It leaves my skin supple and moisturized. The item shipped quickly and was packaged well. I would purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I got this stuff through I love to review. And I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve  been using it for a few and I can all ready see results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! If you stick to it, you&#x27;ll really see results! I have been searching for many months for a product to lighten the hyperpigmentation in my skin. THIS IS IT! I have only used it for 5 days (twice a day) and my skin tone is FINALLY evening out. It helps with my redness, dark spots and acne scars! It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the price. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product really works on dark spots.  I bought this because if the reviews, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It was expensive, but worth it.  I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> In a very short time I have noticed a change in the spots on my hands. The dark spots have already become lighter on my left hand and the spot on my right hand appears smaller and somewhat lighter. The texture of the product is very nice and a little goes a long way. This is a product I will continue to use as long as necessary! In exchange for this product this is an honest and personal review.</li>
            <li> Patience is well worth it with this cream! I bought this about a month ago directly from their website and started using it at night after cleansing my face before I went to bed. I found it made a difference in the texture of my skin but not an immediate brand new face experience. I will say what I like about this cream is that you can see the difference and it gives a healthy glow to your skin. Also dark spots and acne scars are a lot less noticeable. People noticed and told me... It wasn&#x27;t just me. It works better than those other expensive serums out there!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change on my skin whatsoever. I took a before and after photo to notice the difference between weeks and this product has done nothing to my skin. I still have dark spots, puffy eyes, and my acne scars are still showing. The product claims to erase acne scars and yet mine are still there. Bad investment! trial and error!</li>
            <li> I used every bit of this product exactly as directed and got zero results.  Dermatologists say that my sun/age spots are &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and so more difficult to treat, but no improvement at all is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> I have 2 very visible brown age spots on my face.  Nothing else worked, so I tried this.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my skin either.  Delivery and packaging were fine.  I gave it a star because it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and tried this out to get rid of two new dark spots the size of an eraser tip on my face. I did not notice any lightening of the spots after three months...I&#x27;m trying a different product now</li>
            <li> I had to cancel order</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t worked at all after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I used to have lots of scarring from acne and within a couple weeks I started to notice the scars fading. Before I knew it my skin had cleared up and I&#x27;ve had people tell me how my skin has improved! This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin! I use it at night and in the morning- one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it. I wake up with younger looking skin (I&#x27;m only 22 by the way so even at 22, this will still make me feel even younger!). Pores also are less noticeable from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have problems with hyperpigmentation and this clears it up very quickly. My skin tone is noticeably more even and my complexion looks very bright and healthy. I find I need to use more of this than some other reviewers to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a nice, even coat. I&#x27;ve tried to cut back or even quit due to the cost, but nothing else has worked as well, so I always return. I consider this product a savings when I think of having to pay for laser treatment on my uneven skin tone otherwise.</li>
            <li> Visibly corrected my dark spot as it promised.</li>
            <li> From the first squirt, the pump dislocated and did not work.  Other than that the product seems to work, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading. It took over a month of constant use for me to notice anything. The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but they leave my face looking strange and pale. On an olive skinned person, that is not attractive. It does go on smoothly and feels great on the skin. On to my next bottle!</li>
            <li> After 3 months I haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all.  The lotion was fine on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to skin care products. I don&#x27;t ever expect dramatic results. That said, this product has produced subtle, but noticeable results. The dark spot that I don&#x27;t like has noticeably faded, and my entire complexion is subtly brighter. The cream is lovely to use as well--light and creamy.</li>
            <li> this is a miracle cream, it takes a little while but all the dark spots ust start disappearing. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> As of right now it has done nothing to take away the appearance of the dark spots.  A lot of money for no results.</li>
            <li> Cream is good on skin but had no effect.</li>
            <li> I asked for a sample of this first since it is pricey, but after using it for just one week which is what the sample size lasted for, I went in and bought the full-size product. I have stubborn blemishes from adult acne and my skin can be temperamental. I didn&#x27;t expect Vernal to vanish my blemishes overnight, but they are fading quickly so far! The texture and appearance of my skin has also improved dramatically. My skin looks much younger - fresh appearance, minimized pores, smooth to touch. It&#x27;s expensive, but I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I understand hat this product might not work for everyone but I had great results! I had some old acne scars on my chin and I was tired of using makeup to cover them up so I gave this product a try. Took about 2 weeks of using it twice a day to see a strong improvement in my skin. The hyper pigmented spots have faded completely.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my redness after 2 weeks of applying this.</li>
            <li> This product was so worth the purchase! Ive been using the cream for almost two weeks now and my dark marks from my past breakouts are actually fading! Ive tried everything and nothing has worked as well.</li>
            <li> I used this bottle  completely and I did not saw any results whatsoever I had very high expectations for that.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample, and I am usually really harsh about my sample reviews so that customers are informed, and I want to say this product works amazingly!!! Will most likely have to buy another bottle soon.  I have had issues with dark spots around my eyes and cheeks my entire life, and this product has been great for me.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t seemed to make a difference on the age spot on my face. Disappointed....</li>
            <li> This is my second Vernal brand product. I bought in it conjunction with their HA serum. This product is excellent. After using it just two weeks, I already notice a difference in minor sun spots, and an overall smoothness to my skin tone. This is non-greasy and easy to add under moisturizer or makeup. Seems gentle on my skin (working even better than Clinique&#x27;s line of similar products) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but it did ship fast and free from damage. Item as described. Will let you know how it works!</li>
            <li> Not sure it actually works as I have just received it, but the pump broke after one use and now I have to unscrew the lid to get lotion out. For the price, the pump should be made better. Put in a request to Vernal for a new pump so hopefully they&#x27;ll come through for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - April 9th - Customer service from seller is great and I immediately received a phone call regarding the broken pump.  I was assured that I&#x27;d receive another bottle at no charge, and sure enough I did. I will be watching my credit card statement just to be sure &#x3D;)  You need to use the bottle upside down - there is no straw in it (at least both of mine didn&#x27;t have straws) thus the need for using the bottle upside down. Hoping the lotion works as stated since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks. I have not noticed any changes in my dark spots on my face. I have been applying twice a day. I will not purchase again it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> What an amazing little product! I t started to notice the difference in 4 weeks after I bought it. I use it in the am and then again in the pm before sleep and now my areas of dark spots (upper lip, cheeks, and nose) have faded dramatically. Its totally worth every penny! Less expensive than visiting a doctor for treated my dark spots. This product keeps my skin clear. It really is solid product, I will be buying it again once I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li> This cream is a nice consistency but that is it&#x27;s only quality. Does absolutely nothing to fade or disappear freckles, age spots or anything on the skin. For the money a complete waste would definitely not purchase this item again. Total waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Used it faithfully until gone and it did nothing!!!</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of hyper-pigmentation and scarring from acne. As a result, I do have quite a bit of dark spots - both brownish and red scars. I have been using this product for just over a month and have already seen some results of my scars lightening significantly from what they used to look like. I know it will take a while to see dramatic results concerning the diminishment of my acne scars but my face has never looked better. My skin tone is more even, my complexion is brighter, and face smoother. I have even seen my face become more acne free. I love this product and will continue to use!!!</li>
            <li> One needs to be more patient, when using new products.</li>
            <li> Works great at first with consistent exfoliating.  The second bottle was less effective even with the same regimen I used with the first.  I just stopped using it after I finished the third bottle.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all!! I used it for a month day and night on a few recent acne scars and there is no fading whatsoever on them! Stopped using it.. Wish there was a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff works. I&#x27;m a brown skin girl and it&#x27;s taking my spots away slowly but surely. When I get half way thru the bottle, I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product in January it was my first time using anything from vernal and with the mixed reviews I was cautious in my excitement in how it would work. Overall, after using it for a few months I feel that it has made some difference in my skin. I use approx one pump and rub it over my entire face twice a day, and I feel that there is more evenness to my skin and some of the old acne marks that I had towards my jaw area have grown fainter and some disappeared.Overall great product, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just start this a few days ago and am looking forward to it doing the job everyone says it does.  I need at least two to three weeks to decide.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when it first came out and was impressed with the results. After just a few applications, I noticed a measurable improvement in the evenness of my skin tone. I&#x27;ve tried the others that have come on the market in the years since, but I always come back to this. I have noticed some lighten and dark spot correction already and again it has only been a little over two weeks. No irritation which is great since I have sensitive skin. So far i love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> it helps a bit I have been using for about 4 weeks &amp; have noticed a slight improvement ..will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for weeks now and don&#x27;t see a difference... Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 4 days so I haven&#x27;t seen significant dark spot reduction yet, but my skin feels SO soft and smooth. I&#x27;m amazed to see these kinds of results so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vernal spot cream for about three months now and I can say my acne scars have gone faded significantly! They are still slightly visible, but that is to be expected. I plan to continue using it for a long time. I can usually get by on one pump two times a day, but it does go fast. I&#x27;m almost done with my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift at first for my mother.  It worked very well for her and it also worked for my sister, and I started to notice that  I had some old acne scars so I wanted to use this too.  I purchased this again for myself and have been using it since.  It has worked well for me and I thought it was of great quality too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking to reduce acne scars.</li>
            <li> the pump on my bottle was broken. I&#x27;ve ordered  replacement. I will place  review when i get my new bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months on the spots that I have around my face. After two months I can say that these spots are gone and my skin looks healthier than ever. Granted, my spots were not fully darkened but that is because I didn’t allow them to get that bad. This product is effective and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> using the product as instructed and i do see changes (lightning) of one particular dark area on my face...soooo...i would definitely recommend it to others.,,el fed</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be working well.  I would have given it a 5 star but I have only been using a couple weeks. I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and tone is more even.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked on my skin. Frequent use of hydroquinone left dark spots on my skin. This product fades dark spots and minimized my pores. My face was well hydrated and felt so much better. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks proactively since purchase. This product really does fade acne scars and dark spots. Sometimes I just use it only on a few darker acne scars, for cost-effectiveness and I&#x27;m very pleased with my results. Do yourself a favor and splurge on this serum, it&#x27;s the best serum I&#x27;ve ever found. It goes on like silk and leaves your skin soo smooth. I have not found anything else on the market that works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product morning and evening around my cheek area and most of my forehead. I am seeing the redness in my complexion reduced, a much &#x27;softer&#x27; color to my skin. I also noticed the age spots on my hands start to fade. Since some of the spots were very dark, I didn&#x27;t think it would work. So far I am happy with the results and will continue to use it on my hands and face., I am happy with the texture and appearance of my 60+ year old skin since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have freckles (no many)...I know that you can not remove the freckles (because are hereditary), but at least you can reduce the color. I have using the serum for around 2 months and nothing happens, I can not see any difference in my face. Maybe the product is only for age spots, and not good for freckles...However, when you read the product seems that is wonderful...but is not like that.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my time and money...took a pic of my face before I started using this Spot Corrector,  been taking a pic every week, no improvement...I got this product for the great reviews, but I have to say that I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a week or two. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark spots. Still hopeful</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream about a week. I have three large age spots on my face. It is easy to apply on individual dark spots. The cream is very thin and absorbs easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading yet but will continue using the cream till it&#x27;s empty and will write more later.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot under my eye, bad enough that people have asked me if I had a black eye, this is seeming to make it not as visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and have noticed no difference. I bought this because had good reviews. I have noticed no difference in my skin and my dark spots have not gotten lighter. It may have worked for others but did not work for me. Im not impressed at all with this product and definately is not worth the price! Very dissapointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple months and  really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in skin clarity.  It is a nice day moisturizer under makeup, but dark sport corrector??? haven&#x27;t see that yet.</li>
            <li> Yep, it really does just what they say. After a couple weeks of use my skin felt smoother and softer. After the whole 3 months people were actually commenting on how good my skin looked. It faded dark spots and smoothed the texture without ever once causing irritation. I&#x27;m 47 and I haven&#x27;t had skin this nice since I was 35.</li>
            <li> smells great dosnt leave a sticky greasy residue on you face</li>
            <li> I have finished the first bottle of this cream and see a distinct fading of brown spots.  I have tried several fade creams with little success.  I have received my 2nd purchased bottle and hope to continue to see lighter skin.</li>
            <li> Saw no improvement in the dark spots after finishing two bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used the Clinique brand for 6 months with no results; I&#x27;ve used this for one month and my dark spots are already fading (I&#x27;m a 36-yr-old woman who has tanned for years). I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I like this product I can feel my eyes fresh and smithing</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for several weeks and it does not work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin black person so I have a lot of melanin in my skin.  I purchase this product because after going to a dermatologist for having a few breakouts here and there, a dermatologist prescribed me acne medication that completely ruined my skin. My acne worsened  and as a result, I had very dark acne spots all over my face that even the best concealer couldn&#x27;t conceal. I stop using the medication the dermatologist prescribed and order the new proactive. I&#x27;ve been using proactive for two weeks now and have no new breakouts. I did research as i didn&#x27;t not want to use dangerous bleaching creams like hydroquinone to fade the dark spots. Though this product seems perfect and has great reviews , I was hesitant because of some of the poor reviews by other users. I received  this product on 9/20/14. Today is 9/27/14, there is a drastic improvement in the appearance of my dark spots. Some spots are barely visible while the really dark spots have turn reddish-brown which is a sign that the melanin in the skin is fading. Today as I got ready to step out, I  did not wear any concealer. My Maybeline Matte Mousse was enough to give me a flawless look. I&#x27;m so happy. It&#x27;s only been one week and i did not us this product everyday twice a day. I do not wear this prodcut out. I only wear it when I&#x27;m  home and I will continue to do so since I&#x27;m  getting great results.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like in a month. I did not expect for this product to work so quickly.  I used the proactive mark correcting pads but only for three days before receiving the vernal. Maybe the proactive pads help boost the effectiveness of the product and why I&#x27;m  seeing results so quickly. I do not use the mark correcting pads from proactive since I&#x27;ve been using vernal...I can&#x27;t understand why this product didn&#x27;t work for some people but only a dermatologist can explain that. I never right reviews but wanted to write this to help offset the negative reviews and to let others know that thisis a miracle product for real. It is worth the money. I will spread the word to anyone in need of a great  product like this. I will update again in a month. Good Luck to you all. I hoped I&#x27;ve help someone in making a decision to buy this product or not. Love.</li>
            <li> Using this product for a month already but no visible changes yet. So far not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for the hyperpigmentation on my skin. I had minor amount of hyperpigmentation and post-acne scarring. I have used it religiously, two-times a day, as recommended, for over a month now... my marks have barely lightened... Definitely NOT a dark-spot corrector cream as they claim to be... Giving it 1 star since it at least did not harm my skin... Might just be better to get a few lactic peels from your aesthetician... Total waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I just placed the order of this product, if anyone kno that I can use vernal dark spot corrector with other nighttime treatment?</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t really say that this product performs as advertised, maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but at the same time, I do like it as a moisturizer.  It has little scent, so doesn&#x27;t clash with any other scents one might be wearing, and is very silky and not greasy, so it leaves a very nice surface for applying makeup.  I also like that it contains aloe and coconut oil, rather than chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I may update this review at a later date to five stars if I notice any visible in my skin&#x27;s appearance​.</li>
            <li> Have not really seen any results yet. Will keep using it until i finish it. hopefully i will see something soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that works, but unfortunately this product did NOTHING to reduce the spots from my skin! Very disappointing to say the least!</li>
            <li> I have been using for two months. It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed. It made acne scars that I have had for at least five years fade to nearly nothing. It takes time, but it is definitely worth it. Would recommend. The bottle lasts a while too, which is also a plus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 weeks now and 80% of my acne scars have faded. I have hyper pigmentation and get really frustrated with how easily my face marks from blemishes and bug bites. I use this 2x a day and love how flawless my face is beginning to look. Recently I&#x27;ve been able to step out of the house make-up free, and i love it.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much difference except in the softness of my skin</li>
            <li> Very poor ,has not done anything to my dark spots at all and been using twice daily for a couple of months. Well not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I decided to review this product because of some liver spots on my hands and one on my face. I like how it feels on my skin TOO and the spot on my face is diminishing :-)</li>
            <li> I have used many high end dark spot corrector products ,but this one acts better and faster than all others on the market.It leaves a fresh non oily looking on my face and gives me a beautiful glow instantly.I&#x27;m using it for about 20 days now and the dark spots are really fading and my skin tone got much better over all.I have a light-med skin but the fair (no 1 ) works better on me . So far,I have no cons for this produce.Love it and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Working well! Pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and, after using for about a month, she really likes it for her face. She uses twice a day and feels her face is refreshed. She did not comment on whether the creme actually reduced dark spots.</li>
            <li> It lighten my dark spots and I could see results within a few months.</li>
            <li> Used entire bottle religiously day and night - it didn&#x27;t do anything. It didn&#x27;t even slightly lighten the dark spots I have or prevent me from getting more. Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Does exactly what it claims to do! In just about 1.5-2 weeks I began to see the spots lighten. Now when I apply light foundation to my face you can&#x27;t see some of the sun spots I used to have on my cheeks. I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I hear it is really satisfactory.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using this Vernal spot corrector I can already see a difference in the uneven colorations on my face. Mostly from old acne scarring. My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before. I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing and I&#x27;m a definite believer in this product.</li>
            <li> Just had this for  about a week. Will let you know in a  month or so. But looks promising.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost a month now and have not seen any lightening of my dark spots.  Will continue to use till it&#x27;s gone but truly feel it&#x27;s been a waste of money.  If I see any change, I will update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about a week or so and am seeing my dark spots getting lighter. So far the product is definitely making my skin softer and I am beginning to see (what I think) is a difference in the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks. Also, as a HUGE bonus I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne has cleared up considerably! Great product and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement or result yet. Maybe I need to use it some more months.</li>
            <li> Terrifically textured formula... Lusious feel - great fragrance, not bleachy like other spot correctors I&#x27;ve used. Is light and airy on skin. Will update when used longer to review true darkspot correction claim.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;ll give Vernal Spot Corrector a try to reduce the dark spots on my back. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have been very impressed! My age/sun spots are fading! As an added bonus, my skin is glowingly beautiful. That said, everyone is unique and therefore what works for me may not for you. The serum is light weight and pleasant in odor. It goes onto the skin without tugging and is easily absorbed - and - for me - works! Wishing you all health and ease......</li>
            <li> I have some dark spot and I tried different products before. I bought it because I read the reviews on Amazon. I have been using it for almost a month, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement...I have to say at least this product is not working on me.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have been very impressed! I could tell almost immediately that my skin tone was getting lighter and the spots were fading. This is one quarter the cost of others and my skin has improved and brightened within a few weeks, and my old makeup looks orange now. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone that has dealt with age spots and acne scarring - the product is incredible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dark spots on my face from sun exposure, acne scars. I&#x27;ve been using this product for only A FEW DAYS - and I already love it! My skin is sensitive to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, but this has definitely been worth the money (and as a college student, that says a lot!). I&#x27;ve already seen my dark spots fade dramatically. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> was not worth the money. it did nothing</li>
            <li> Frankly I am amazed that this product is fading some discolorations on my leg without having to resort to hydroquinone. Excellent &amp; shipped promptly!</li>
            <li> Once a month I have a problem with acne which can leave some dark scars on my tan complexion. A few are large enough to be a nuisance and I have tried a few corrector solutions that either flat out did not work at all or left my face feeling so oily (Bio-oil) that I would immediately wash/wipe it off. I give this cream 5 stars because it #1. does not have that oily feel to it--rather it&#x27;s a light cream that you forget you even put on your face 5 minutes later #2. works--I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and the troublesome spots that have been on my face for awhile now have begun to fade; I imagine if I actually stuck to the regimen properly (once in morning and night), it would work better, but sometimes I forget so it has worked good for someone like myself who is pretty forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap was hard at first to remove for me and I ended up yanking the whole top off so my first application, I thought there was no pump supplied which would have been a nuisance with continued use, but at second use, I tugged less lightly I supposed and only the cap came off to reveal the pump. I didn&#x27;t think the cream would do well because it&#x27;s very light, but it turns out that has allowed it to actually stay on my face because it blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave an after-film or oily residue that would make me want to wipe it off. It works too so the makeup must be ok. After trying products like Bio-oil without any success, I didn&#x27;t really think there was a legitimate dark spot corrector cream; I am glad that Vernal has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Lot of hype and promises but I can see no results</li>
            <li> This product did almost nothing for me after using the whole bottle. My dark spots look the same. No fading of any spots at all. Maybe my 40 something year old skin is just more stubborn about releasing the hyperpigmentation. My skin did not have any reaction to this - positive or negative so I guess I am glad it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing. I felt that the vitamin C serum I used was better.</li>
            <li> Only used for three weeks but my skin has improved, both in dark spot correction but&lt;br /&gt;also in skin tone, much smoother and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
            <li> just got it so will take a while to see how it works....hears hopen</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day for about 2-3 weeks now and I must say, it does what it claims! It didn&#x27;t make me break out, dry my skin, make me oily....I have to admit, I am shocked this is working. I developed these dark spots after I had my children and after medications from the doctor didn&#x27;t work, I thought nothing would...but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but this stuff actually works. It faded the freckles on my cheekbones and dark spots near the corners of my eyes. It lightened coloration around the corners of my mouth. This was after a month of using daily. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks, my sun-damaged skin looked better. It feels good going on, absorbs quickly, and really made my skin look and feel smooth. I can already notice how dark spots have faded. My skin complexion has also improved, it&#x27;s now more even and balanced with few discolored blotchy areas. Many compliments came my way after a two weeks of using the wonder cream! I will be back for more</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life! I had a lot of acne scaring (had, key word). Even in the first few days of use, you see results! It&#x27;s amazing. I will always repurchase this. Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I do not think this product is useful and effective to my skin problem, so basically I kind regret that I chose to buy it. Based on the high price of it, it is totally not worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> This works great!!! It lightened my dark circles under my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> It has dimmed the spots a little.</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle and yet effective dark spot corrector! If you are looking for an immediate result, this is not for you. I find those use harsh chemicals that dry out my skin and cause flakes. I think the price justify a hydrating and effective spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for about 2 weeks. It seems like the couple of spots where I have been applying the cream have lightened a little. I am sure that with continuous use the spots will fade. I have had no irritation. I am making sure to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this spot corrector for four weeks and I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in my dark spots. I felt a need to splurge on this product since I am getting enganged and although makeup offers the help I need to cover my acne scars, I wanted a little piece of mind and security . I am so happy I gave this serum a chance, I don&#x27;t typically do reviews for skincare products but for anyone who has felt frustrated from dark spots, don&#x27;t look any further you must give this product a try! I use it morning/evening every day, so make sure you keep up with the routine and you&#x27;re sure to see an improvement!</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into your skin. I like that a lot about this product. Also non irritating. Only started using this product one week ago and some sun spots are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> Does it work? I truly cannot tell. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any difference after using this product over one month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and this product has truly corrected my dark spots/post acne marks. In the past year, I was left with acne marks from when I was younger. I have tried several other products, but this one has helped me out the most. . given that you have to use it consecutively like any other regular product out there. The acne marks that this product helped me lighten were not all new. Therefore, the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector can help fix old acne marks as well as new!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, which creates acne, which in turn, creates scaring on my face. I have been using this serum for the past 5+ months and it has literally diminished the look and appearance of ALL of my acne scars! Surface scars as well as deep scars! Just love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any lessening of dark spots and have used for months.</li>
            <li> I began using this product a few weeks ago and have had noticeable improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture. Some sun spots have diminished greatly. I have received compliments on my skin since using. . I agree that it is a little pricey, for the amount that you get, but from my experience, whitening or evening skin tone products aren&#x27;t exactly cheap. I would for sure repurchase :)</li>
            <li> Just after 3 days I have seen a vast improvement in my skin tone. I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, and above my lip, and it has already lightened, and broken up the dark spots. I have never used a product that has worked so fast. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> This product was simply waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28, but I have some dark spots from sun damage and old acne scars. I tried this on a whim after a friend recommended it. At first I was skeptical, but my friend swore up and down that it would work after a couple months. At the very least, it made a good toner! I used it on my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin. The spots were darkest and most noticeable on my chin, but I have a few freckles across my nose that I was hoping would fade a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know when it started to work, but at some point I was going through my morning makeup routine and realized that I didn&#x27;t need to use color-correcting concealer on my dark spots. Not only did my dark spots and acne scars get lighter, my freckles have faded. My natural complexion is a lot more even now. I still use foundation if I&#x27;m planning to use full-face evening makeup, but for a daytime look it&#x27;s not necessary. My skin looks brighter!</li>
            <li> I washed  and dried my hands, then applied a small amount of the spot corrector. Twice a week I exfoliated my skin. I never missed my application. I did feel a stinging of the skin As a mild acid would feel. After a few weeks I added 100 sun block on the back of my hands. I could notice more of a difference with the sun block. I will continue to use the rest of the spot corrector. I will report a change.</li>
            <li> The product really lightens the dark spots and best of all, gives the skin a nice, supple appearance.</li>
            <li> not that great of a product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th week, started noticing results my 3rd! After only three weeks of using this spot corrector I can already see a difference in the uneven colorations on my face. Mostly from old acne scarring. My skintone is becoming more even and the spots are much less noticeable than before. I think the difference I&#x27;m seeing after only a couple of weeks is amazing and I&#x27;m a definite believer in this product.</li>
            <li> I normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for most products I buy. But I just bought this about a month and a half ago. The last couple of years or so I&#x27;ve had breakouts on my chin and forehead. I&#x27;ve just recently gotten this under control. But once the blemishes cleared I had dark spots all over my chin and forehead. I was uncomfortable being too close to people and looking at them straight on. I never left the house without foundation and was really stressed. I was hesitant to try this product because I typically have very sensitive skin to most cosmetics but to my surprise after full use of the bottle all but my worst dark spots are almost completely gone, and my worst ones are faded quite a lot! I&#x27;m comfortable wearing no makeup around the house with my roommates, and am close to going out on the town with zero foundation! LOVE this product and will continue to use to combat dark spots!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, only one time a day rather than two and my skin is glowing! The hyperpigmentation seems to be lightening but my skin is literally glowing. I am confident enough after trying this to buy the whole line!</li>
            <li> I tried many creams in the past: Clinique, Estee Lauder, Shiseido, MD-7, vita-K, and bunch of others.  This is the only cream that I can see dark spots on my face reduce.  It took more than 1/2 bottle before I saw the result.  Hopefully, it clears up more.</li>
            <li> Great item..It actually works as advertised. I am using it to &amp;#34;dissolve&amp;#34; so called liver spots(age spots) and they are disappearing</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star as I purchased to remove discolorations on my left cheek.  I have been using for 2 + months morning and evening along with sunscreen and (extremely dissapointed) have not noticed any sort of difference.  After reading all the prior reviews, I was highly hopeful this would work but it has not.  Looks like I have to get a chemical peel or laser to remove the spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very slowly..spots are becoming a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I have past acne scarring, and this really helps with it. I was amazed with the results that it gave! You just need to be patient in order to get results. It took about at least a month to see a difference, so don&#x27;t fret if you don&#x27;t see any visible improvements. My mother also uses it as she has freckles and dark spots on her face, and my grandma actually pointed out that her skin looks a lot more clear &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to whole bottles of this, twice a day, not missing a single day, but to my dismay, ZERO results.  I&#x27;ve wasted $100.00.  I had high hopes and was willing to go for something that promised good results.  Terribly disappointed and ripped off.</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference after 6 weeks of twice a day religious use.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 2 weeks and happy with results. Also using retional and vitamin c products for which this is a nice addition.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does not help clear dark marks, well at least not mines and I used this for 3 months and have not seen any results. Would not recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I need to wait longer before I can give an accurate review.  Nothing negative to report.  More to come later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/2/14 update.  Now that I have used the product for two months I can detect a difference although not significant.  On a scale of 1 - 5, I would rate it a 3.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and much cheaper than some of the other options and works just as well. I was skeptical about this product at first but I am pleasantly surprised. I have some sun spots on my cheeks that tend to reappear as I get more sun in the spring and summer months. (After three weeks of using this product on my cheeks, I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in the color of the spots! Before use I&#x27;d say the spots were two to three shades darker, but after the spots are only about one shade darker!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clear up a few spots on my face.  Shortly after starting to use it, my face broke out really bad and now I have more spots than I&#x27;ve ever had.  I read the reviews and thought this would work for me.  Everything works differently for everyone, this did not work for me.  Now I have to figure out how to correct the breakout and clear my skin.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks&#x27; usage, I did see the improvement of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product. It reduces dark spots, colors, and in some case, improve your skin status</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a month now not much change in the sunspots.  I did use it on my son though, who went to AZ and got some dark freckles while there.  It worked great on him!</li>
            <li> The seller is amazing. Let me begin by saying that I tried obagi for 6 months and saw no results, my skin peeled like crazy, my face looked worse than ever and it gave me acne. I&#x27;m not even half way through this product and my skin is glowing, even, and fading spots. I love it. I will never stop using it! Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vernel N-E spot corrector to get rid of some &amp;#34;liver&amp;#34; spots on the top of both hands. After using and finishing the bottle for a month my aging spots have not even faded. This was a total scam.</li>
            <li> I would like to put to you here take advantage of this product I  purchased after reading most of the review of customers where I am impressed by what is said about ,  and what I suffer from a remote spot in my face time in the cheeks area took me enthusiasm to buy this magical product that I&#x27;m  looking for from long time. . but the result is the opposite expected did not get on any result where I used the entire bottle to no avail Is it reasonable to buy a month this amount with the payment of shipping charges and how much of the jar can be consumed to get the result lethal .. I prefer to resort to cosmetic better than wasting Clinics amount of and without access to a satisfactory outcome</li>
            <li> I use this almost twice daily (always at nighttime), and there is a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin. My skin looks radiant and flawless. But they are not kidding when they say use daily and wear sunblock - you can&#x27;t keep doing bad to your skin and think this will miraculously fix everything.</li>
            <li> I started to use the product every night and morning as it said on the bottle... and I have to admit- I became a bit frustrated because I didn&#x27;t see improvements for about a week or so. I&#x27;m glad I decided to stick with it. Now, I am almost done with the bottle and I see tremendous improvements in sun spots/ age spots around the back of my hands, shoulders and cheeks. Some spots are completely faded while others are almost there. Glad I tried this product out.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Spot Corrector for about a week and can tell a difference. My spots look lighter and my skin has an overall more even appearance. I have no regrets paying a little extra for a product that worked so quickly! My skin is looking so flawless- I don&#x27;t even wear that much foundation. Love! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. It comes in a heft large bottle for the amount of cream inside (1 fl oz). Overpackaging Overmarking  Funny on the packaging it says SPF 30. If you used this as a sunscreen you would run out before on application on the face. Dermatologist recommend at least 2 fl oz to cover the face and most people do not use enough sunscreen to begin with. It would get very expensive to use this for much of anything.    I get two people who find my review unhelpful probably because of my sunscreen comment. They probably work for the company or sell the product.    I don&#x27;t know if it actually works as a dark spot corrector. You would have to buy many bottles and use for awhile. I believe the price to amount of cream they are selling they are trying to take advantage of people.</li>
            <li> Fades dark spot wonderfully. Love this cream</li>
            <li> The spots appear to have faded slightly, but I am almost thru one container and would have thought I would have seen a more substantial change.  I have another one and will continue to use it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Did NOT….. make a difference in the dark spots on my face. The dark spot are the very same as before, absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for two weeks. I was not expecting to experience the radical improvement that others did, but I did and I can definitely tell there&#x27;s a huge difference. I have a couple of brown spots on my face and am still &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t get age spots&amp;#34;, I thought. Anyway, after two weeks I could barely see anything. I am still using it twice a day and am now so I hope to continue to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I have not used it,expecting a good effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face for over a month. It did lighten the dark spots on my face, but did not completely eliminate them.  I will continue using until the last drop, and see what happen.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal NE Dark Spot Corrector Cream for about three weeks now.  I have really noticed a difference.  My dark spots are fading and some other of my skin spots are clearing up.  I definitely will try another bottle when this one is used up.  So far the bottle is lasting a really long time.</li>
            <li> The only word I can say is &amp;#34;trash&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!! It has gotten rid of the age spots on my face without a &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; effect.  In other words, my skin does not have bleached or white patches where the age spots have been erased or greatly minimized.  I also put it on the backs of my hands where it works great, too.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific hand cream--very neutral scent and sinks in fast. I keep a tube in the car so I can apply it regularly- of course applying regular SPF keeps the dark spots away so it&#x27;s great in combination with this product. I wish they had a smaller, travel tube that I could carry in my purse easily, though.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, but that it didn&#x27;t work. Just another product let down. Went to dermatologist and got a prescription strength product. I don&#x27;t have any major dark spots, just a couple of light small spots that I wanted to get rid of. Am 32 years old &amp; being proactive.</li>
            <li> I need not see any improvement at all I us it as soon I got it,</li>
            <li> I have really seen an awesome difference in my skin since the beginning. I have very bad acne scars all over my face and plenty of dark spots that made me look sickly.Over the course of the month I really started noticing my acne scars had started to lighten up a lot. My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with dark spots. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle I decided to review and give honest opinion. It states it minimizes dark spots. It did exactly what it was suppose to do. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month and have noticed that my dark spots appear a bit lighter which is a good sign.  I apply this product twice a day every day.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be like with longterm use!</li>
            <li> With time, this product has produced some amazing results! I never thought that my skin would look THIS GOOD from a spot corrector! I thought that my spots were so bad I would have to go to some high priced dermatologist for some high priced treatment to get rid of them. I was so wrong! This product is truly magic in a bottle! If you are willing to dedicate the time and consistency to using this product you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Dispenser stopped working halfway through. The product is okay but not as good as another I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much changed at this point...maybe a little lightening but not enough to notice</li>
            <li> Love this product. I could tell instantly how great it is.  I have a few spots, that I have noticed a real difference.. I recieved this product to review and I would say I would and will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for two weeks to get rid of my dark acne spot scars. I like how it feels and I like that it&#x27;s reducing the intensity of my acne scars. My lighter scars virtually disappeared, and now my skin tone is way more clear and even. It&#x27;s lightweight and 2 pumps covers the face. It does moisturize but not enough for my skin which needs more hydration. I absolutely like it and am definitely gonna buy another when I go thru my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the purpose of eliminating my hyper pigmentation caused from pregnancy and possibly over sun exposure.  When I got this I instantly read the ingredients so I could see what I was putting on my skin.  Most of the ingredients are simple effective, natural ingredients including licorice root which is said to help with hyper pigmentation/dark spots.  It gets warm on your face.  My face was heated, (not burning or discomforting at all) I felt like it was helping the circulation of the blood in my face instantly.  I see gradual results and I&#x27;ve used other products skin lightening cream that have not been as effective but I&#x27;ve still yet to see full results with this.  The blotchy areas are fading and I&#x27;m making sure I use sunscreen daily in my foundation to avoid making my hyper pigmentation worse and so far so good.  I&#x27;ve only been using for maybe not even a month but close to a month so I don&#x27;t expect full results yet anyway but the overall appearance of my skin is rejuvenated and much more clear, even from acne or blemishes.  There&#x27;s no chemical smell that I&#x27;ve found with other products and it seems to work naturally not just some gimmicky chemical ointment.  I haven&#x27;t looked at all the ingredients and studied each and every one but some of the first ingredients, I instantly recognized from my earlier research on natural remedies for hyper pigmentation.  Overall, you can definitely feel this work the moment you apply it.  I will keep you posted if I see the full results I am after.  My skin has had this hyper pigmentation for a few years now.  UGGGHHH!!!</li>
            <li> Been using for about 3 weeks for stubborn dark spots. So far, my skin is EXTREMELY smooth and my overall skin tone is lighter. The spots are still there but slightly lighter. Will continue to use as I think continuous use for several months, based on my results thus far, will completely remove spots. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I am actually noticing results in just a few weeks.  I&#x27;ll try to post again after 3 months...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 1 month now, and I may have some lightening of my dark spots. I had hoped for more noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, and has helped to clear up my acne scarring fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I had acne scars on both my face, and neck and was overwhelmed and extremely depressed&lt;br /&gt;because it seemed like NOTHING helped clear it up. When my friend told me to try this stuff&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, and because of it&#x27;s price at $49.95 I really wasn&#x27;t sure...&lt;br /&gt;but... it&#x27;s worth it! I&#x27;ve tried over 10 over the counter products, and 3 prescription&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;and none of them worked even remotely as good as Vernal! I recommend this product, and the only&lt;br /&gt;CON I would say is to use a 15 SPF sunscreen as labeled in the indications.</li>
            <li> I was very patient and used the entire bottle, but no result for me. I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is in fairy good condition. I expected more visible result but nothing at all. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft, but did nothing for my hyper-pigmentation. Highly disappointing, considering the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to say the least, but bought this with my holiday gift card just to see if it could work. I am amazed by how fast I&#x27;ve started to see real results (about 3 weeks) and can&#x27;t wait to see them at 6 weeks! After years in the sun I have a definite &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; along my cheekbones and up by my temples, and even the most concentrated spot has lightened already. It certainly hasn&#x27;t disappeared, but there is noticeable improvement. I will definitely continue using this miracle product!</li>
            <li> Just after 3 days I have seen a vast improvement in my skin tone. I really love this product! I have tried so many different products over the years but this one I&#x27;m really impressed with. My acne dark spots are fading and I notice a more even skin tone and smaller pores. I have been using it twice a day.I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, and above my lip, and it has already lightened, and broken up the dark spots. I have never used a product that has worked so fast!!!!!! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 months twice a day and saw very minimal reduction in dark spots. I use 55 SPF as my moisturizer and I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> After trying other spot correctors in the market I decided to move forward with this one. It&#x27;s been two months since my original purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.. It is gentle enough to use every day, though I only applied once a day before bed. It made acne scars that I have had for at least five years fade to nearly nothing. It takes time, but it is definitely worth it. Would recommend. The bottle lasts a while too, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden an ugly dark spot seemed to prominently appear out of nowhere on my face when I hit 45. I was about to go to the dermatologist but thought I&#x27;d try this product first. While it took a few months to erase (applied twice daily), I no longer see the spot. Better yet, my skin tone seems much more even, my skin feels great andI have not broken out once since using this this product. I do wish it was not so expensive, as I need to now maintain this regiment, but as long as it works so well, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I have used Vernal  for almost two months. I have light skin and the dark spots are still there, but slightly lighter. I, also, use Oil of Olay tone corrector at night after applying the Vernalskincare. The difference is enough that I ordered a second bottle. I had been using the product from City Lights for greater than 6 months with no significant nor lightening effects. Vernal worked better than City Lights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks but it seems to be fading some of my spots.  I think it&#x27;s to soon to give it a 5 star but I&#x27;ll come back in a couple of weeks.  Pricy but I think it&#x27;s going to be worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works so well with my skin and absorbs fully which is a HUGE PLUS! I have used so many spot correctors in the past where you still felt the product on the spots you applied it to or make up would look different in the area over it. This product absorbs so well that I do not feel a difference on the area that I applied it to and I do not see a difference once my makeup is applied. After two months of use, my spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I use for month no results seen I don&#x27;t recommended it</li>
            <li> After having tried a lot of products that promised results, I am really happy to report that his product does what it says it will. I have used it for less than a week and already see fading of the deeper pigmented spots. It is expensive but the bottle size is generous. I am almost 65 and my skin responded to it well....with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for awhile now and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, a little pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. have to say that I see difference in the appearance of my scar only after a few time of using this product. My recent acne scar is noticeably lighter (but it&#x27;s still there). If it continues to work the way it is working now, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase it. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s expensive...I care that my scars are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I am in my mid-40&#x27;s, olive complexion, oily skin prone to breakouts, and increasingly dryer skin and fine lines around my eyes needing more TLC.  I have been an active person all of my life - spending much of my time outside in the summer, which has resulted in additional fine lines and sun spots.  In terms of radiance, I literally did a double take as I walked past the mirror one morning after about two weeks of using the product.  Lines are less noticeable and my skin definitely looks firmer and more youthful (skin looks less puffy in some spots, less sagging in others, less tired in general).  Jury is still out, though, on the dark spot correction, which is why I bought the product in the first place.  However, in fairness, I don&#x27;t believe that I have been using the product long enough to see any improvement in the dark spots, which I anticipate to take several weeks-several months.  But for the other improvements alone I give this a 5.  Best stuff I&#x27;ve used for more youthful skin, including a prescription product from the dermatologist.  For someone with oily/combination skin, it applies nicely and feels good and breathable on the skin.</li>
            <li> My story is a little different than most of the reviewers. I am well past my prime, into my sixties. I am a child from the 1950&#x27;s, from a time when there was no knowledge of the dangers from being out in the sun, and neither sunblock nor sunscreen had been invented. As children, we were encouraged to stay out all day and get the &#x60;healthy sunlight&#x27; and a tan. Summer meant spending the day at a beach or someone&#x27;s pool, without any skin/sun protection. In my teenage years, sunblock was introduced to the public, and it was a greasy white zinc oxide that fair complexioned children wore on their noses. It was funny looking and embarrassing to wear. Then in the 1970&#x27;s when I was well into my twenties, a form of sunblock/sunscreen became available, but unfortunately, no one really understood the dangers of UVA/UVB rays, and so we would use mediocre drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after almost 30 years, of unprotected skin, the damage had already been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am in my sixties and I had started to notice that many people in my age bracket had those ugly brown sunspots on their faces. I scrutinized my own face, and yes, I had them too. Last winter I ordered the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream, but then while at my dermatologist, I was offered a CO2 treatment. I took the treatment for both my face and neck. It was painful and expensive, but it worked. However, as summer started, I noticed that my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; was dark with freckles (sunspots), enough to make me feel self-conscious about wearing some of my summer clothes. My face and neck was now clear of the sunspots, which made the sunspots on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; even more prominent. As I said above, the CO2 treatment is both painful and expensive, so I started using the Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream that I had ordered from Amazon last winter, on my chest, twice a day, morning, and evening. I have finished a little over 15% of the cream, and there is a visible lightening. Yes, I still do have spots, but they are substantially lighter, and not as dense. Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately. As an extra bonus, it also works for me as a skin softener. I have started to wear some of my summer items that I was not planning to ever wear again. I am no longer self-conscious because the dark freckles on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; are considerably lighter and less dense. Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream is working for me.are substantially lighter, and not as dense. Vernal Spot Corrector has no fragrance, it is light and creamy, and it absorbs immediately.

            <li> I was given a sample of this product, and a week later I bought the product. I struggle with enlarged pores on my nose, and since using this product they have diffidently minimized. I&#x27;m a skin care specialist, so I know pores can&#x27;t shrink but after using this product I&#x27;m starting to think differently. Even my co workers noticed. It feels very silky on the skin, without feeling oily. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and I am amazed that my old acne scars have lightened a lot. I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion is amazing. I feel that the money is very worth it given the results that I have seen. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after four and six weeks! I debated on laser treatments but I no longer will pursue them.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a year - has lighted up a few very dark spots - best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This product has the smell of makeup that is too old.  It is really bad.  I wrote to the seller about it, asking if it was just the smell it has, but he never replied.</li>
            <li> Works like it said it  would.</li>
            <li> fast shipping - great product</li>
            <li> Just received and started using this product on 7/16/2015.  There were no instructions as far as how long to wait to see visible results.  I&#x27;ll continue using the product until the bottle is empty.  Perhaps by then I will be able to tell whether it worked on my Melasma condition or not.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t warrant the price because it doesn&#x27;t work after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> I waited until I used my full bottle before leaving a review. I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for the past two years and recently purchased multiple products to try and tame my skin. I bought this to try and see if it could get rid of all of my dark marks that I absolutely hate and I have been using it a month and I already see a difference. My dark marks have faded immensely, I&#x27;m not breaking out as often and when I do, it&#x27;s only 1 at a time, and my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a couple of weeks and I can already see the results. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve looking for. A light-weighted, silky smooth, and fragrance free facial cream.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.. my honest opinion for a promotional price</li>
            <li> So far i have not seen any results yet.  I hope after one month i will see some result.  keeping fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for the results but so far I like the way my skin feels. I use it once a day, and at night. I use another Vernal product in the day and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great company. Hoping my red acne scars fade.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HAVE NOTICED AN LIGHTING OF THE DARK SPOTS. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the product.  While I used it all over my face, I had a circle of brown spots which was my main test site.  After about a month of usage, the brown spots are going away.  In fact, they no longer form a circle as some are already gone.  Impressive.  And a little goes a long way.  Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have dark spots under my eyes... I&#x27;m an insomniac so it can&#x27;t help prevented. I was given a coupon for this stuff to try out. I have been using it after I wash my face and before I put on my makeup. It seems to be helping make the dark spots lighter.</li>
            <li> I have just used 2 days on my face and my neck, my face have broken out terribly as well as my neck. I saw some reviewers said those 5 star reviews are fake, but  I just wanted to try out. I rarely post review when amazon ask me to. I now post mine because I want people to save their money and avoid those fake 5 stars review, those reviews just like a scam.</li>
            <li> Religiously applied for 30days. Has no affect on me. Disappointed with waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vernal Dark Spot corrector for over 2 months and just purchased another bottle, so I won’t run out. I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling iron burn marks fade dramatically. I&#x27;ve reviewed this product in the past and will continue to recommend it. This stuff works!!!</li>
            <li> I was using Clinique before switching to Vernal spot corrector and I&#x27;m glad I did. It claims that you will be seeing improvements in a month, but I have been using it as a spot treatment for 2 weeks and its already working. A spot that I had on my cheek is almost completely gone. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is very obvious that my dark spots has faded.  I am so satisfied that I ordered another bottle to continue the fading process.  I have about 1/4 of the first bottle left.  I have tried other products that didn&#x27;t work.  Thumbs up to this product.  I definitely recommend Vernal!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this corrector! After a summer full of sun this totally recorrects any sun spots I may have! I&#x27;ve tried a few other brighteners and dark spot correctors and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out. It also clears up my skin, I get fewer breakouts when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love how this product made my skin feel! It&#x27;s only been 4 days of use and I already notice a difference in my skin, will definitely order more!!😊</li>
            <li> I received this as a free/promotional item and it has done very well. I don&#x27;t have alot of dark spots on my face but did on my hands and it has worked well for those ones. I do notice a little bit of a glowey dew to my face since using this product!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to see too much change within the first month, however I am blown away! My spots are about 1/3 gone and their improving every day. I feel that this product was worth beyond the price because it ACTUALLY DELIVERS RESULTS!!! I’m so happy that I will never have to waste money trying out spot correctors again because this one is an absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> Can I use it as a whitening cream?</li>
            <li> Very good cream it really work</li>
            <li> I. Have been using this product for a week now, my skin feel better, but I will give it a little more try before I can fully comments on it, so far so good</li>
            <li> I finished one bottle of this stuff, and I can honestly say that one spot is completely gone while the others are fading. It took over a month of constant use for me to notice anything. The large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but they leave my face looking strange and pale. This spot corrector works for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!  It helped with my pregnancy stretch marks!!!! Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product works!  It has caused some breaking out for me, but I break out very easily. It does fade dark spots, though - better than any other product I have tried.</li>
