            <li>It made my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>because i own a dayspa  </li>
            <li>if I see this much of a difference in one month, I&#x27;ll really be impressed in another month - and beyond.  </li>
            <li>if I see this much of a difference in one month, I&#x27;ll really be impressed in another month - and beyond.  </li>
            <li>This is the one I have liked the best so far.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs quickly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li>Before ordering I did some research to see why Swiss apple stem cell serum was becoming so popular and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I gave this two stars for the quick shipping and arriving in good condition.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I hesitated, but now I am glad I forked over my money.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>and i sure will be ordering this product.</li>
            <li>, so I can&#x27;t put it on my chest, which tends to be the most rosacea-prone and therefore irritated.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with it that I have tried several others.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and absorbs quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I believe it takes 6 months to really know if you have good results</li>
            <li>This seems to be a strong serum.  </li>
            <li>Everyone noticed how clear, glowy pinkish  and bright my face was</li>
            <li>So far so good:</li>
            <li>but so far, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>A comment reminded me I never did update as promised in my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give it a couple more months.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give it a couple more months.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on easy and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>(NutriBullet: a huge handful of fresh spinach and 1/2 a cucumber -</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product for me is that it doesn&#x27;t disturb the effectiveness of other products; it rather enhances their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, within 5 days.  </li>
            <li>quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more soft and even my husband noticed!</li>
            <li>so I could lather my whole body in in after the shower !!</li>
            <li>, so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results after the first three days</li>
            <li>product that will not just make my skin LOOK better temporarily, but something that will &amp;#34;turn back the clock&amp;#34; on a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t put 2-and-2 together, but I think it might be the Swiss Apple stuff.  </li>

            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t put 2-and-2 together, but I think it might be the Swiss Apple stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Swiss Botany product I used.</li>
            <li>Really helps my skin!</li>
            <li>Had never used this particular type of product before, only OTC  ones &amp; I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are less noticeable &amp; filling in nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very realistic person when comes to skin treatments</li>
            <li>This serum feels natural,  on my skin which is very light complexion and ultra-sensitive reddish Irish skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference between improving the appearance of skin and actually improving skin.)  </li>
            <li>At 64 I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles, and I still don&#x27;t wear much make up.</li>
            <li>I waited to post this review because one can&#x27;t really tell if a skincare product is working until one gives it a chance.  </li>
            <li>It really lives up to it&#x27;s claim of noticeable results within 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two days and must say it really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is something I would recommend to anyone who wants to see their lines disappear.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with Swiss Botany &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I resigned myself to the fact that I&#x27;m getting older and that I would have to accept the wrinkles, age spots, sagging muscles, and thinning skin on my face, neck, chest, and hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure  you know that the reviews for most beauty products are contrived or &amp;#34;purchased.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Which is very hard to find good products.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I think it takes a little more time .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 73 years old &amp; wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I dont normally respond or write ...</li>
            <li>At the advice of my dermatologist&#x27;s assistant, I started using Vitamin C serum instead, but the kind with L-ascorbic acid - it must contain that, or it&#x27;s not nearly as effective.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t added anything else new to my routine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t added anything else new to my routine.)  </li>
            <li>makes skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t take time for the whitening mask I use this product because it takes just a little amount for my face and neck and helps to decrease the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This firmed my key areas and I could see a real difference in days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like it , but it is still early.</li>
            <li>I was surprised..</li>
            <li>and i am feeling tightness on my sagging area near my jaw line that wasnt there before.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is all natural and not too too pricey.</li>
            <li>Then again, I also started &amp;#34;juicing&amp;#34; every day since June 1st, so that is likely the main reason my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li>A pretty big claim and one you only see on Retin-A or products containing glycolic acid, etc.  </li>
            <li>A pretty big claim and one you only see on Retin-A or products containing glycolic acid, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for a month and am now trying a new serum from same company (a newer one that just came out and targets brown spots).</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago, I started applying a paste made of oatmeal, aloe vera gel, tea tree oil, and turmeric and leaving it on my chest several days a week for about an hour, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in my rosacea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But not a uncomfortable tightness like some other serums i have tried before.</li>
            <li>But those products always irritated my sensitive and rosacea-prone skin BIG time, and I ended up throwing or giving them away.  </li>
            <li>But those products always irritated my sensitive and rosacea-prone skin BIG time, and I ended up throwing or giving them away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m open to any options that will work, that is natural, that won&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li>So, for a 47-year old low maintenance type of person, this has become my go-to anti-aging skin product.</li>
            <li>For my particular case (I&#x27;m starting to notice some fine lines and my skin looks a little tired), it really improved a lot in general appearance.</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was very fast, I&#x27;m impatient and it came within 2-3 days of my ordering it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of products like this one, but I decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve been noticing more lines and wrinkles and some dry areas of my face.</li>
            <li> and that other than hormone replacement therapy and consuming TONS of dark green veggies and citrus fruits - there&#x27;s only so much you can do to improve aging skin internally.  </li>
            <li> I finally realized that other than Retin-A and chemical peels, there&#x27;s not really much you can do to improve your skin externally -</li>
            <li> Dry spots are gone.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s only $10 less per month than my cell phone bill -</li>

            <li> I would give this a 5/5 if the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> After careful research and reading reviews, however, I decided to try this Swiss Apple product - despite the $38 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After careful research and reading reviews, however, I decided to try this Swiss Apple product - despite the $38 price tag.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I steam my face then apply the product. My skin is looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum. It made my skin feel amazing and it smells wonderful. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I am on a tight budget cannot waste a nickel. I hesitated, but now I am glad I forked over my money. At 64 I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles, and I still don&#x27;t wear much make up. I just wanted to maintain if possible.  This firmed my key areas and I could see a real difference in days.  I just recently was invited to dinner by a.younger guy, so I got my money&#x27;s worth. On to another bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of products like this one, but I decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve been noticing more lines and wrinkles and some dry areas of my face. This product did the trick for me. My skin feels more soft and even my husband noticed! I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews for products, but for this one I had to! Looking forward to trying more products from swiss botany! Also the shipping was very fast, I&#x27;m impatient and it came within 2-3 days of my ordering it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs quickly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I waited to post this review because one can&#x27;t really tell if a skincare product is working until one gives it a chance.  My &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; are noticeably diminished.  This seems to be a strong serum.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I like it , but it is still early. I think it takes a little more time . I have seen some soften of lines.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It arrived quickly, within 5 days.  Had never used this particular type of product before, only OTC  ones &amp; I am so pleased with the results. I&#x27;m 73 years old &amp; wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I was surprised.. Had a few dry spots from sun damage &amp; all the wrinkles that go along with my age. Been using two weeks now.I concentrated application around my eyes &amp; mouth . My wrinkles are less noticeable &amp; filling in nicely. Dry spots are gone.  My skin is softer than I can remember it being in years. I&#x27;m so pleased with Swiss Botany &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum! Feel the firming&lt;br /&gt;effects quickly. Like the consistency&lt;br /&gt;of product- small amount goes a long&lt;br /&gt;way. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5/5 if the bottle was a little bigger. I use it on my entire fave and noticed an immediate improvement in skin tone and elasticity. I just wish there was an industrial size so I could lather my whole body in in after the shower !!</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars for the quick shipping and arriving in good condition.  As for the product, it actually made me break out severely.  Just not good for my skin type I guess.  I will just keep using my coconut oil as I do.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! In my 50+ years I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of facial products but nothing like this one. It really lives up to it&#x27;s claim of noticeable results within 3 days. My skin is softer, smoother and glowing! As soon as the serum is applied you can feel it working, firming and toning. It soaks into my skin without feeling greasy. It feels good with a very pleasant aroma. Before ordering I did some research to see why Swiss apple stem cell serum was becoming so popular and decided to give it a try. I found it at Swiss Botany for a good price and a money-back guarantee. I definitely haven&#x27;t been disappointed!  Because of this product I will be ordering others from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product! I always have wanted to try something like this! It absorbs instantly into the skin not sticky at all feels great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very realistic person when comes to skin treatments and I expect improvements not miracles. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two days and must say it really exceeded my expectations. For my particular case (I&#x27;m starting to notice some fine lines and my skin looks a little tired), it really improved a lot in general appearance. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t take time for the whitening mask I use this product because it takes just a little amount for my face and neck and helps to decrease the fine lines.  I started seeing results after the first three days and it makes my face feel good.  This is something I would recommend to anyone who wants to see their lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I waited 3 weeks of continous daily use before giving my feedback and now my verdict is it Works!!! I dont normally respond or write ...it  just wasnt  my style  but i just have to for the sake of others who are still undecided... i used my dermaroller everyday together with this product and  because i own a dayspa  I face a lot of clients daily and i have to be esthetically  on my best and always to be an example for them. Everyone noticed how clear, glowy pinkish  and bright my face was and i am feeling tightness on my sagging area near my jaw line that wasnt there before. I credit this to me,  product and procedure all combined to achieving this wonderful face skin.  Thank you for this product and i sure will be ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, it goes on easy and soaks right in.  I definitely recommend this product, and I will be purchasing another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> A comment reminded me I never did update as promised in my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Apple Stem Cell Serum did make a difference in my skin texture, I cannot afford an additional $38 a month.  At the advice of my dermatologist&#x27;s assistant, I started using Vitamin C serum instead, but the kind with L-ascorbic acid - it must contain that, or it&#x27;s not nearly as effective.  I started the Vit C with L-a.a. on June 1st, and I can see a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s smoother and it has a &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; look to it.  (It&#x27;s also a lot less expensive.)  Then again, I also started &amp;#34;juicing&amp;#34; every day since June 1st, so that is likely the main reason my skin is glowing.  (NutriBullet: a huge handful of fresh spinach and 1/2 a cucumber - sometimes twice a day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, it the Vit C serum with L-a.a. does sting when I apply it, so I can&#x27;t put it on my chest, which tends to be the most rosacea-prone and therefore irritated.  But that&#x27;s okay.  A few weeks ago, I started applying a paste made of oatmeal, aloe vera gel, tea tree oil, and turmeric and leaving it on my chest several days a week for about an hour, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in my rosacea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried enough &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; skincare products in my life to fill a bathtub - and spent enough money to pay for a year of college - only to be disappointed time and time again.  I finally realized that other than Retin-A and chemical peels, there&#x27;s not really much you can do to improve your skin externally - and that other than hormone replacement therapy and consuming TONS of dark green veggies and citrus fruits - there&#x27;s only so much you can do to improve aging skin internally.  (Notice I didn&#x27;t say improve the APPEARANCE of skin - a phrase skincare products are required to use.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between improving the appearance of skin and actually improving skin.)  Anyway, I resigned myself to the fact that I&#x27;m getting older and that I would have to accept the wrinkles, age spots, sagging muscles, and thinning skin on my face, neck, chest, and hands.  But I&#x27;m still looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product that will not just make my skin LOOK better temporarily, but something that will &amp;#34;turn back the clock&amp;#34; on a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m surfing Amazon&#x27;s skincare products and I see this Swiss Apple Stem Cell Serum.  They allege it REMOVES fines lines, etc.  A pretty big claim and one you only see on Retin-A or products containing glycolic acid, etc.  But those products always irritated my sensitive and rosacea-prone skin BIG time, and I ended up throwing or giving them away.  After careful research and reading reviews, however, I decided to try this Swiss Apple product - despite the $38 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now, and I am encouraged by the improvement in my skin.  In fact, I sat down in front of my make-up mirror this past weekend to hurriedly and mindlessly apply the serum and to attend to the rest of my routine, and I realized, &amp;#34;Hey!  My skin looks smoother!&amp;#34;  At first, I didn&#x27;t put 2-and-2 together, but I think it might be the Swiss Apple stuff.  (I haven&#x27;t added anything else new to my routine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not &amp;#34;wowed,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve only been using it a month.  I have a feeling if I see this much of a difference in one month, I&#x27;ll really be impressed in another month - and beyond.  Yes, I&#x27;m hesitant to fork over $38 for one skincare product - heck, that&#x27;s only $10 less per month than my cell phone bill - but I&#x27;m willing to give it a couple more months.  I&#x27;ll report back at that time.rinkles, age spots, sagging muscles, and thinning skin on my face, neck, chest, and hands.

            <li> I&#x27;m open to any options that will work, that is natural, that won&#x27;t damage my skin. I have been using clover honey as a protein wash before i use the swiss apple serum. Once i apply the serum I do feel my face tightening up. But not a uncomfortable tightness like some other serums i have tried before. This serum feels natural,  on my skin which is very light complexion and ultra-sensitive reddish Irish skin. Which is very hard to find good products. But I will gladly give this product a great rating I am a happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure  you know that the reviews for most beauty products are contrived or &amp;#34;purchased.&amp;#34;  I do, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So . . . I feel like an idiot for having bought this product - just because certain respected celebrities &amp;#34;supposedly&amp;#34; use it.  I have now used this product for about 6 weeks.  I do not see any results at all.  If anything, I find it to be rather drying.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product for me is that it doesn&#x27;t disturb the effectiveness of other products; it rather enhances their effectiveness. I love it, love it, love it and I recommend its usage am and pm as a first base to other facial products.</li>
            <li> So far so good: I have been using this serum for a month and am now trying a new serum from same company (a newer one that just came out and targets brown spots). I like it and I like that it is all natural and not too too pricey. I believe it takes 6 months to really know if you have good results so I will review again but so far, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> This is the first Swiss Botany product I used. I was so impressed with it that I have tried several others. This is the one I have liked the best so far. I use it once or twice a day. It has a pleasant smell and absorbs quickly and easily. It leaves my skin a little dry, so I usually use a moisturizer (with SPF) on top. I can apply that almost immediately. What is has done for me is dramatically lighten dark spots that were left over from places where pre-cancerous areas were &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; off and tighten and firm my skin on my face and neck. It has had a noticeable enough impact that several people have commented that I look younger. So, for a 47-year old low maintenance type of person, this has become my go-to anti-aging skin product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It smells great and consistency is good. Really helps my skin! I will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I saw zero difference after two bottles of this serum.</li>
            <li> makes skin very soft.  A little goes a long way</li>
