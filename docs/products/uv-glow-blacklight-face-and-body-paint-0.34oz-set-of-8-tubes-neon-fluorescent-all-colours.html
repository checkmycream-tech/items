            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>Have to reapply a couple times for a good affect.  </li>
            <li>Good product though.  </li>
            <li>Product was packaged in good padded envelope then in another envelope so that was not product it was manufacturing of container.</li>
            <li>product was good, thou not as uv reactive as you would think.</li>
            <li>Some colors glowed more than others but all looked great.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Let me say that I received these at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  </li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I do not have a very strong UV or blacklight</li>
            <li>Or with fingers but brushes work better.</li>
            <li>I love these paints.  </li>
            <li>sure you let dry!&lt;br /&gt;Bright</li>
            <li>but there was plenty for the three of us plus one more</li>
            <li>Pretty good effect.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a good quality blacklight body paint.</li>
            <li>it was cool!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>With that said, even with the lack of a good light, these are glowing really well with what we have.</li>
            <li>The colors were bright and vivid.</li>
            <li>Very fun &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li>These are really great black light paints!</li>
            <li>Kids had fun applying it, and was easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and looks great under black light.</li>
            <li>Kids had a fun time with it &amp; it was easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the packaged they were super excited to try these.  </li>
            <li>The warmer colors tend to glow brighter than the cooler colors, but I think that is true of any UV reactive materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tubes are definitely smaller at .34oz each, but you can get a good amount of use out of each tube.</li>
            <li>Now, I have to tell you, I handed these to my 8yr old and she proceeded to paint her own and her brother&#x27;s faces.  </li>
            <li>this is a kids product and not for any kind of professional bodypainting.</li>
            <li>Great value and glowed on body and clothes as expected!</li>
            <li>Worked great and washed off without trouble in the shower.</li>
            <li>fun</li>
            <li>Kids had fun painting, but no glow.</li>
            <li>However, if you use a makeup brush/applicator, you can really come up with some clean designs.</li>
            <li>It stayed on relatively well for a two hour dance and it reacted to the black lights brilliantly!</li>
            <li>tubes packed with long lasting bright fun!</li>
            <li>but we have a light bulb that they are going to be having lots of fun with in a few more minutes.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely keep buying these for my stock. :)</li>
            <li>I got these for my photography business to for black light body painting and I love them.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and they are super bright!</li>
            <li>Much smaller than I expected but still happy with them.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li>The best thing was that there was not a huge mess in my bathroom when she was done.</li>
            <li>These are really fun to play with and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>Each tube is sealed with a pull tab inside the tube, which is definitely appreciated.  </li>
            <li>We carried small black lights with us and everyone was really impressed!</li>
            <li>Bright and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well unless the lights are all off and there is nothing but black light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experience any irritation from these paints, but those with sensitive skin might.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, my bathroom was not a mess...</li>
            <li>but the paint really does go a long way!</li>

            <li> The tubes are pretty small, but a little bit of paint goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Apply with small soft bristle paint brushes.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about how small these were, but I painted about 30 people&#x27;s faces with it including some body art and still have enough for another night!</li>
            <li> I might put it on a little heavy just in case.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been doing Halloween makeup for a few years all throughout the year.  </li>

            <li> We had plenty to share, even though the bottles were small.</li>
            <li> i would recommend for small groups and small parties.</li>
            <li> Small tubes</li>
            <li> Just get two orders if you are going to need a lot, the tubes are small!!</li>
            <li> Alas, we had to wait.  </li>
            <li> It was a thin consistency</li>
            <li> Some colors go on thin, so if you use your fingers to apply the paint, it will come out blotchy.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad at all.  </li>

            <li> I love these paints.  The warmer colors tend to glow brighter than the cooler colors, but I think that is true of any UV reactive materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star because the ingredients contain &amp;#34;Formaldehyde&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t experience any irritation from these paints, but those with sensitive skin might.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors.  Goes on easily and looks great under black light.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Stayed on all night even though I sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you let dry!&lt;br /&gt;Bright fun colors!&lt;br /&gt;Small tubes packed with long lasting bright fun!</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully! I might put it on a little heavy just in case.</li>
            <li> These are really great black light paints! A little goes a long way, and they are super bright! These are really fun to play with and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of these in the future! I would certainly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a good quality blacklight body paint.</li>
            <li> I told my kids that I had a treat coming their way.  As soon as I opened the packaged they were super excited to try these.  Alas, we had to wait.  I allowed them to put it on mid-afternoon and they have been wearing it for a total of 5 hours now.  Let me say that I received these at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  This is my honest opinion.  The tubes are definitely smaller at .34oz each, but you can get a good amount of use out of each tube. Each tube is sealed with a pull tab inside the tube, which is definitely appreciated.  The colors are so vibrant and fun.  Now, I have to tell you, I handed these to my 8yr old and she proceeded to paint her own and her brother&#x27;s faces.  She used her fingers and a makeup brush to apply it and that was all.  The best thing was that there was not a huge mess in my bathroom when she was done. I did put some on my hand before giving it to them to play with.  It was a thin consistency but it wasn&#x27;t too bad at all.  As I mentioned, my bathroom was not a mess...lol.  I do not have a very strong UV or blacklight but we have a light bulb that they are going to be having lots of fun with in a few more minutes.  With that said, even with the lack of a good light, these are glowing really well with what we have. These are a definite must have for us. My daughter has been doing Halloween makeup for a few years all throughout the year.  She loves to put on face paint.  SHE LOVES THESE!!!  I think these will make great stocking stuffers for her.</li>
            <li> Glow well and are great colors!  Just get two orders if you are going to need a lot, the tubes are small!!</li>
            <li> Excellent paint for backlight parties!!</li>
            <li> The colors on these is gorgeous! Bright and a little goes a long way! We used them during a night time color run and had a blast! We carried small black lights with us and everyone was really impressed! it was cool!</li>
            <li> Worked great and washed off without trouble in the shower. The product goes a long way. I was concerned there would not be enough for the three of us to use for our Glo Run but there was plenty for the three of us plus one more and we still had plenty left. Even after we were done running the paint was still there. Both pictures are after running a 5K.</li>
            <li> I was worried about how small these were, but I painted about 30 people&#x27;s faces with it including some body art and still have enough for another night! Some colors glowed more than others but all looked great.</li>
            <li> this is a kids product and not for any kind of professional bodypainting.</li>
            <li> It so good and go on great good payoff</li>
            <li> Worked great. Kids had a fun time with it &amp; it was easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> Pretty good effect. Some colors go on thin, so if you use your fingers to apply the paint, it will come out blotchy. However, if you use a makeup brush/applicator, you can really come up with some clean designs. We had plenty to share, even though the bottles were small.</li>
            <li> Wasted money ordering. Product containers seal leaked all over inside of package so threw it all away. Product was packaged in good padded envelope then in another envelope so that was not product it was manufacturing of container.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a glow run my friend and I were going to. Used them to decorate our shirts our faces, her son&#x27;s face, and had enough leftover to give to a mother and her 3 kids to use at the race.  Ordering again for another blacklight run I&#x27;m going to.</li>
            <li> product was good, thou not as uv reactive as you would think. nevertheless my guests at my party had a blast with the product as well as the children. i would recommend for small groups and small parties.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t glow at all. Kids had fun painting, but no glow.Big bummer at a glow themed party</li>
            <li> Loved these! The colors were bright and vivid. Much smaller than I expected but still happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great value and glowed on body and clothes as expected! Small tubes but the paint really does go a long way! Great buy</li>
            <li> I got these for my photography business to for black light body painting and I love them. The tubes are pretty small, but a little bit of paint goes a long way. Will definitely keep buying these for my stock. :)</li>
