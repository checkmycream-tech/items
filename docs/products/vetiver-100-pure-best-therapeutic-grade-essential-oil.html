            <li>Nice smell, quite like peanuts..would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a woodsy, smokey type scent.  </li>
            <li>“*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The bottle also doesn&#x27;t tell you how the oil was extracted, which would be nice to know since some methods can damage or ruin the purity of the oil.</li>
            <li>I love how the smell seems to warm up and diffuse a bit with body heat.  </li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Great quality, and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I should have realized that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Everything about the order went very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good quality, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Good customer service, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many of these oils and am using them as the opportunity arises.  </li>
            <li>This oil is called for in many diffuser blends.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is beneficial though I&#x27;d have to use it for a longer period of time to be sure.</li>
            <li>love this oil.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to find it more fragrant.</li>
            <li>A lot of the recipes I will be using call for Vetiver, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>But I have had 3 nights without the pain, which has made my days better.</li>
            <li>I purchase many EO&#x27;s online</li>
            <li>Put it in carrier oil for better healing.  </li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>i love vetiver, vut</li>
            <li>Love this oil-</li>
            <li>This vetiver is much more liquidy, you can in fact dispense it through the restrictor cap without issue.</li>
            <li>This one smells better than most others.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>Not as potent as what I got from Edens garden.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for efficacy more than price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I received this product for free to write an honest review.  </li>
            <li>Seems to make me a bit more &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality oil that will be great for making essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>Okay this is Part One of a 2 part Review.</li>
            <li>I am a sensitivity disaster and would recommend this as SAFE for ALL.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>ORGANIC need I say more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I needed vetiver for some essential oil combinations and this will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Helps me relax after a stressful day at work! :)</li>
            <li>I love the Vetiver.  </li>
            <li>and i love the earthy smell,</li>
            <li>essential oils are awesome</li>
            <li>My grand children sleep better after I rub their feet with it before bed.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off taking it off and using a squeeze dropper to dispense the oil.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes, and that&#x27;s when you can get it out of the bottle!!!  </li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Smells great,  high quality</li>
            <li>very reasonable price, good quality.</li>
            <li>This oil, which should have  a very strong, rich earthy scent, arrived with NO aroma at all.</li>
            <li>So far it is working great.</li>
            <li>But have EASILY removed it with a set of needle-nose pliers.</li>
            <li>Bought for me, my husband immediately loved the smell and has taken this for his own daily post-shower dab.  </li>
            <li>She is sleeping so much more peacefully!</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle and am offering my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>So earthy and fresh :)</li>
            <li>The oil is a great quality and I have purchased several others from this company.</li>
            <li>Light woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil quality.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling essential oil.</li>
            <li>I received an Email asking me to Order (they made it completely free) and Review it.</li>
            <li>There is a reason the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>Chose because of Prime 2 day free shipping.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this oil to use in a blend (with lavender and cedarwood) to help my son  focus during his studies.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed all my oils from Healing Solutions and I will most definitely purchase more oils from them.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t respond to the original email address.</li>
            <li>really enjoy the sweet, earthy aroma of this oil.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li>So excited to start using this product.</li>
            <li>Compared to Young Living this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, smells pure.  </li>
            <li>Sweet grassy earthy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>The doTerra oils are good also, but the prices are almost double to what Aura Cacia&#x27;s are.</li>
            <li>The smell if off putting, but when its mixed its good.</li>
            <li>Not really bad though.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this to help grandchild to focus and so far while using this at home it seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the smell was slightly more potent.</li>
            <li>Shipped out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Favorite new oil...will be buying again</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!!</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of light for an essential oil which makes me iffy on how pure it is.</li>
            <li>She is new to EOs and was excited at the prospect of moderately-priced oils with such good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is  an amazing Essential oil!</li>
            <li>This oil has a very earthy smell to it, almost like dirt, but I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It makes grandkids calm and sleep all night</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>It seems to help my six year old focus a bit better in school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite natural plant essences ever.</li>
            <li>it,s exciting to read about all the herbs.</li>
            <li>I am BIG on how a company helps you, they were Easy to reach and Fantastic to deal with.</li>
            <li>I have been giving it a few days to make sure my findings are correct, and it appears to be Very useful in treating Whiplash of the neck!</li>
            <li>Very Much Recommend</li>
            <li>I am quite oily, own many brands, have favorites, and have used long enough to be able to speak fluently enough about the quality of an oil.  </li>
            <li>nice and strong scent, great for my base note in my diy perfume.</li>
            <li>This one is almost for sure mixed with a V6 oil instead of being 100% Vetiver oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, as an owner of 50+ 100% essential oils that I mix with a V6 myself, I am pretty sure based on smell, viscosity and even color</li>
            <li>I was going to get juniper oil, but decided to get Vetiver first.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I apply it to the back of his neck in the morning, sometimes I will add some more in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>Another top essential oil by Healing Solutions, recommend.</li>
            <li>My Father has Carpal Tunnel, the first I know of this, in the mornings he cant make a fist.</li>
            <li>hope it really works for keeping kids focused on homework!</li>
            <li>My wife ordered these for various purposes - mostly health-related.</li>
            <li>This is the first from Healing Solutions.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working pretty well for sleep.</li>
            <li>It may smell earthy, woody, and exotic to Westerners, but to me and my family, it smells exactlyy like Eastern Asian oriental medicine.</li>
            <li>I used this before I went to bed the first night I had it</li>
            <li>It works well to promote calm or help calm before bed, and it works even better when blended with other calming oils.  </li>
            <li>The kind I like (which is no longer available) is THICK like molasses.</li>
            <li>It is NOT for internal use, its for Topical massage or a diffuser to make your house smell good.</li>
            <li>But this may be the most heavenly essential oil to those who really like the smell of oriental medicine.</li>
            <li>It is very calming and soothing, and the price for this is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Got fast and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The introduction to this product out of the blue has given me an interest in more types of this particular plant.</li>
            <li>Product states that it&#x27;s 100% pure, but what it doesn&#x27;t tell you is what percentage of the solution is pure.</li>
            <li>There is NO WAY that this oil is 100% pure oil.  </li>
            <li>It says 100% pure therapeutic grade</li>
            <li>I have another bottle from the same company (tea tree) and that pours just fine.  </li>
            <li>With the usage guide they are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>really does feel calming.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for much yet</li>
            <li>It was much thinner and lighter in color.  </li>
            <li>But this one really works well along as well.</li>
            <li>Very manly scent, used in a beard  oil recipe for my bf</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the seller had fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see the benefits as of yet.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Working very well....</li>
            <li>Very earthy.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>no leakage during shipping, packed very well -</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product quality as listed</li>
            <li>This is the first time we&#x27;ve tried vetiver oil, and so far we&#x27;re liking it very well.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I purchased did not have the liquid smoke scent to it, the second bottle very much had the liquid smoke scent.</li>
            <li>Very nice and authentic smell, but unlike the other oils the smell is faint.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly adulterated.</li>
            <li>Have used it a couple of times and really like the results so far.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the hassle of sending back.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, but then again most essential oils are.</li>
            <li>We actually like the grassy woodsy fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Good smell, but not great.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived very fast, it indicates its not for internal use.</li>
            <li>Very Earthy, And A Slight Twist Of Sweet Balance.</li>
            <li>I think this is because its not aged very long.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this will sit on a shelf in the bathroom while I look for another alternative.</li>
            <li>I dont have a diffuser, but am interested in such now...    </li>
            <li>Great oil, mixed it with a few other ones I have.</li>
            <li>Got it for concentration and it seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend to try on her son who has ADHD but is too young to medicate yet.</li>
            <li>The bottle was labeled Vetiver but is far inferior.</li>
            <li>Very calming when rubbed on the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this oil</li>
            <li>I have been committed to the Young Living brand</li>
            <li>Think old cooking oil smell.  </li>
            <li>like this essential oil very well.</li>
            <li>Of those four, only the geranium had any real scent or potency.</li>
            <li>Still early to see if it&#x27;s going to help</li>
            <li>But as a first time buyer I&#x27;m a little less than pleased.</li>
            <li>I love vetiver, and I use it daily in layering with other essential oils.</li>
            <li>This is a decent starter/beginner essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>Some nights, I wake up anyway, but usually put more on and back to sleep!</li>
            <li>The grassy scent takes a little getting used to but is not unpleasant and smells natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how pure this essential oil is nor what the true quality is.</li>
            <li>but this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve received that was filled less than 3/4 of the way</li>
            <li>I bought this to help my son with ADHD calm down.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as Valerian, at least not on me.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t to strong and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>He rarely takes a nap and today with the diffuser on, he was out within minutes of laying down!</li>
            <li>Really hasnt been long enough yet</li>
            <li>It is clearly a quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Must have been several years old.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to use with my young son who was diagnosed recently with ADHD.</li>
            <li>Have been trying oils from different companies as I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li>, this is my first negative experience, NOW is a decent brand..</li>
            <li>This can last all day, now for the first in ages he says-he woke with NO Issue in that hand after a night time application, his neck isnt bothering him either, and he had to sleep on a couch no less last night due to the holiday and not being home!</li>
            <li>I looked it up on here, then I tracked down the Company and sent them the email to see if it was &#x27;real&#x27;,</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with focus issues at all (yet?), but it is a wonderful oil for skin healing, diluted in coconut oil with some lavender.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  </li>
            <li> Smells great!</li>

            <li> Ok I will admit I was drawn in by all the remarks about how unique and wonderful this product smelt.....</li>
            <li> I love vetiver!</li>
            <li> A drop rubbed onto the bottom of each foot lets me sleep much better than I used to!</li>

            <li> Nice smell, quite like peanuts..would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a woodsy, smokey type scent.  </li>
            <li> “*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> The bottle also doesn&#x27;t tell you how the oil was extracted, which would be nice to know since some methods can damage or ruin the purity of the oil.</li>
            <li> I love how the smell seems to warm up and diffuse a bit with body heat.  </li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great quality, and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I should have realized that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Everything about the order went very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Good quality, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Good customer service, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many of these oils and am using them as the opportunity arises.  </li>
            <li> This oil is called for in many diffuser blends.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is beneficial though I&#x27;d have to use it for a longer period of time to be sure.</li>
            <li> love this oil.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to find it more fragrant.</li>
            <li> A lot of the recipes I will be using call for Vetiver, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> But I have had 3 nights without the pain, which has made my days better.</li>
            <li> I purchase many EO&#x27;s online</li>
            <li> Put it in carrier oil for better healing.  </li>
            <li> Love It.</li>
            <li> i love vetiver, vut</li>
            <li> Love this oil-</li>
            <li> This vetiver is much more liquidy, you can in fact dispense it through the restrictor cap without issue.</li>
            <li> This one smells better than most others.</li>
            <li> I love that</li>
            <li> Not as potent as what I got from Edens garden.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for efficacy more than price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to write an honest review.  </li>
            <li> Seems to make me a bit more &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality oil that will be great for making essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> Okay this is Part One of a 2 part Review.</li>
            <li> I am a sensitivity disaster and would recommend this as SAFE for ALL.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> ORGANIC need I say more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I needed vetiver for some essential oil combinations and this will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Helps me relax after a stressful day at work! :)</li>
            <li> I love the Vetiver.  </li>
            <li> and i love the earthy smell,</li>
            <li> essential oils are awesome</li>
            <li> My grand children sleep better after I rub their feet with it before bed.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off taking it off and using a squeeze dropper to dispense the oil.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes, and that&#x27;s when you can get it out of the bottle!!!  </li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Smells great,  high quality</li>
            <li> very reasonable price, good quality.</li>
            <li> This oil, which should have  a very strong, rich earthy scent, arrived with NO aroma at all.</li>
            <li> So far it is working great.</li>
            <li> But have EASILY removed it with a set of needle-nose pliers.</li>
            <li> Bought for me, my husband immediately loved the smell and has taken this for his own daily post-shower dab.  </li>
            <li> She is sleeping so much more peacefully!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle and am offering my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> So earthy and fresh :)</li>
            <li> The oil is a great quality and I have purchased several others from this company.</li>
            <li> Light woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li> Great essential oil quality.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling essential oil.</li>
            <li> I received an Email asking me to Order (they made it completely free) and Review it.</li>
            <li> There is a reason the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> Chose because of Prime 2 day free shipping.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this oil to use in a blend (with lavender and cedarwood) to help my son  focus during his studies.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all my oils from Healing Solutions and I will most definitely purchase more oils from them.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t respond to the original email address.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the sweet, earthy aroma of this oil.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li> So excited to start using this product.</li>
            <li> Compared to Young Living this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, smells pure.  </li>
            <li> Sweet grassy earthy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> The doTerra oils are good also, but the prices are almost double to what Aura Cacia&#x27;s are.</li>
            <li> The smell if off putting, but when its mixed its good.</li>
            <li> Not really bad though.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this to help grandchild to focus and so far while using this at home it seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the smell was slightly more potent.</li>
            <li> Shipped out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Favorite new oil...will be buying again</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!!</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of light for an essential oil which makes me iffy on how pure it is.</li>
            <li> She is new to EOs and was excited at the prospect of moderately-priced oils with such good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is  an amazing Essential oil!</li>
            <li> This oil has a very earthy smell to it, almost like dirt, but I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It makes grandkids calm and sleep all night</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> It seems to help my six year old focus a bit better in school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite natural plant essences ever.</li>
            <li> it,s exciting to read about all the herbs.</li>
            <li> I am BIG on how a company helps you, they were Easy to reach and Fantastic to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have been giving it a few days to make sure my findings are correct, and it appears to be Very useful in treating Whiplash of the neck!</li>
            <li> Very Much Recommend</li>
            <li> I am quite oily, own many brands, have favorites, and have used long enough to be able to speak fluently enough about the quality of an oil.  </li>
            <li> nice and strong scent, great for my base note in my diy perfume.</li>
            <li> This one is almost for sure mixed with a V6 oil instead of being 100% Vetiver oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as an owner of 50+ 100% essential oils that I mix with a V6 myself, I am pretty sure based on smell, viscosity and even color</li>
            <li> I was going to get juniper oil, but decided to get Vetiver first.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I apply it to the back of his neck in the morning, sometimes I will add some more in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> Another top essential oil by Healing Solutions, recommend.</li>
            <li> My Father has Carpal Tunnel, the first I know of this, in the mornings he cant make a fist.</li>
            <li> hope it really works for keeping kids focused on homework!</li>
            <li> My wife ordered these for various purposes - mostly health-related.</li>
            <li> This is the first from Healing Solutions.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working pretty well for sleep.</li>
            <li> It may smell earthy, woody, and exotic to Westerners, but to me and my family, it smells exactlyy like Eastern Asian oriental medicine.</li>
            <li> I used this before I went to bed the first night I had it</li>
            <li> It works well to promote calm or help calm before bed, and it works even better when blended with other calming oils.  </li>
            <li> The kind I like (which is no longer available) is THICK like molasses.</li>
            <li> It is NOT for internal use, its for Topical massage or a diffuser to make your house smell good.</li>
            <li> But this may be the most heavenly essential oil to those who really like the smell of oriental medicine.</li>
            <li> It is very calming and soothing, and the price for this is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Got fast and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The introduction to this product out of the blue has given me an interest in more types of this particular plant.</li>
            <li> Product states that it&#x27;s 100% pure, but what it doesn&#x27;t tell you is what percentage of the solution is pure.</li>
            <li> There is NO WAY that this oil is 100% pure oil.  </li>
            <li> It says 100% pure therapeutic grade</li>
            <li> I have another bottle from the same company (tea tree) and that pours just fine.  </li>
            <li> With the usage guide they are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> really does feel calming.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for much yet</li>
            <li> It was much thinner and lighter in color.  </li>
            <li> But this one really works well along as well.</li>
            <li> Very manly scent, used in a beard  oil recipe for my bf</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the seller had fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see the benefits as of yet.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Working very well....</li>
            <li> Very earthy.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> no leakage during shipping, packed very well -</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product quality as listed</li>
            <li> This is the first time we&#x27;ve tried vetiver oil, and so far we&#x27;re liking it very well.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased did not have the liquid smoke scent to it, the second bottle very much had the liquid smoke scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice and authentic smell, but unlike the other oils the smell is faint.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly adulterated.</li>
            <li> Have used it a couple of times and really like the results so far.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the hassle of sending back.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, but then again most essential oils are.</li>
            <li> We actually like the grassy woodsy fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Good smell, but not great.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived very fast, it indicates its not for internal use.</li>
            <li> Very Earthy, And A Slight Twist Of Sweet Balance.</li>
            <li> I think this is because its not aged very long.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this will sit on a shelf in the bathroom while I look for another alternative.</li>
            <li> I dont have a diffuser, but am interested in such now...    </li>
            <li> Great oil, mixed it with a few other ones I have.</li>
            <li> Got it for concentration and it seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend to try on her son who has ADHD but is too young to medicate yet.</li>
            <li> The bottle was labeled Vetiver but is far inferior.</li>
            <li> Very calming when rubbed on the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this oil</li>
            <li> I have been committed to the Young Living brand</li>
            <li> Think old cooking oil smell.  </li>
            <li> like this essential oil very well.</li>
            <li> Of those four, only the geranium had any real scent or potency.</li>
            <li> Still early to see if it&#x27;s going to help</li>
            <li> But as a first time buyer I&#x27;m a little less than pleased.</li>
            <li> I love vetiver, and I use it daily in layering with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter/beginner essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> Some nights, I wake up anyway, but usually put more on and back to sleep!</li>
            <li> The grassy scent takes a little getting used to but is not unpleasant and smells natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how pure this essential oil is nor what the true quality is.</li>
            <li> but this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve received that was filled less than 3/4 of the way</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son with ADHD calm down.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as Valerian, at least not on me.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t to strong and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> He rarely takes a nap and today with the diffuser on, he was out within minutes of laying down!</li>
            <li> Really hasnt been long enough yet</li>
            <li> It is clearly a quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Must have been several years old.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my young son who was diagnosed recently with ADHD.</li>
            <li> Have been trying oils from different companies as I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> , this is my first negative experience, NOW is a decent brand..</li>
            <li> This can last all day, now for the first in ages he says-he woke with NO Issue in that hand after a night time application, his neck isnt bothering him either, and he had to sleep on a couch no less last night due to the holiday and not being home!</li>
            <li> I looked it up on here, then I tracked down the Company and sent them the email to see if it was &#x27;real&#x27;,</li>
            <li> It has a number of uses both internal and external, though the bottle states &amp;#34;not for internal use&amp;#34;. I have dry skin from tanning</li>
            <li> absolutely zero scent, very thick, appears to be new and unopened</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the other Vetiver oils I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere, barely any hint of odor.</li>
            <li> realize this oil is about 1/3 price of other oils, but do yourself a favor and save your money and buy the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> though it was a rather bigger box than necessary for one little bottle of essential oil....</li>
            <li> a light oil with faint scent...</li>
            <li> but it seems to help keep my skin clear when I apply a few drops with my face lotion or some coconut oil before bed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it a few nights for our 4 year old, 2 drops rubbed on her feet.</li>
            <li> 10cc is not very much.</li>
            <li> May need a little long to make a final observation.  </li>
            <li> I was not familiar with Vetiver Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> Got my bottle on time, maybe a little earlier.  </li>
            <li> I also mix it with a carrier oil in a roller bottle and apply it to the back of my neck in the morning, and I feel less testy with other people.</li>
            <li> It smells like wet soil.  </li>
            <li> not really the smell (kinda like pipe tobacco)</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious about the oil...</li>
            <li> or if you&#x27;re just looking for last ditch pain relief of tight swollen mussels Grab it!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with other oils to see if it would help my great-grandson with his ADD and school work.</li>
            <li> It blends well with other oils and carriers.</li>
            <li> I used this with other oils for a mood stabilizer.</li>
            <li> I know my nerve pain from the neck injury in both my hand and foot have abruptly stopped since the use of this began.</li>
            <li> i,m waiting for other oils for my mixtures.</li>
            <li> I will be combining with other oils to make a a calming mixture.</li>
            <li> so obviously the product is a dud, just noticed a few other recent reviews that were very negative..</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t necessarily a terrible thing, since all essential oils should be applied topically with a carrier oil to prevent rashes, burning, etc especially with hot oils.  </li>
            <li> The scent is usually described differently by each person using it, but I like to describe it as a green smell, or a peanut butter-y smell.  </li>
            <li> I am not experiencing the pain or stiffness thats usually holding me back from everyday activities, like riding the bus to get things done.</li>
            <li> Earthy scent that I use together w organic fractionated coconut oil to make my own mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a watered down version.  </li>
            <li> I think this just might be slightly defective.</li>
            <li> Also the dropper cap is too small, or tight, for such a thick oil.</li>
            <li> Less waste.</li>
            <li> Something about that little spout inside the bottle causes vapor lock and product won&#x27;t drip out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Drips with a few taps.  </li>
            <li> So pissed I wasted my money 😡</li>
            <li> I diffuse this nearly everyday</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble sleeping at night and heard that vetiver helps.</li>
            <li> I am scent sensitive, big time, and the smell is very faint out of the bottle, earthy yes, and doesn&#x27;t trigger any negative side-effects, nor does the oil its self seem to cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> There is very little odor to the product.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I usually use it in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is how it&#x27;s suppose to be or not.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this is that it is difficult to get the dropper to work.  </li>
            <li> Small, but works well, therapudic grade</li>
            <li> Thick amber colored oil.</li>
            <li> This vetiver, although describes itself as being &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, is not as thick as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> The size is also very small-</li>
            <li> I usually get a stabbing pain when I lift my head of the pillow to turn to the other side.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, it&#x27;s quite watery, not viscous like true vetiver oil should be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s outdoorsy and subtle and grassy.  </li>
            <li> It has very little scent and the little it does have stinks.</li>
            <li> The ylang ylang and veiver had a weak to low-moderate smell, and the bergamot?</li>
            <li> Very thick,</li>
            <li> Not happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The oil I got was stale.  </li>
            <li> It keeps anything from leaking, so if I travel, Ill reinsert it.</li>
            <li> If I can handle it, it&#x27;s highly unlikely anyone else would have any issues.     </li>
            <li> The aroma is not pleasant or unpleasant - it reminds me of something</li>
            <li> stinks at first....but helped my foot</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I took the plastic stopper/dripper out as impossible to get anything to come out of it.  </li>
            <li> Just bad.  </li>
            <li> Ive been frustrated by the drip tube, I dont know if thats just to keep it from leaking?</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I can&#x27;t get a refund even though I just found this information.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is at its worst when I sleep.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible....</li>
            <li> It smells AWFUL!</li>
            <li> This oil is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This was a terrible purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have gotten many of these oils and am using them as the opportunity arises.  With the usage guide they are very convenient to use. I am treating everything from tick bites to joint aches.... and amazingly enough, they seem to be helping.  A word of caution however, I am told that you need to &amp;#34;change up&amp;#34; your applications (use different oils) about every 6-8 weeks</li>
            <li> This oil is called for in many diffuser blends. I am pleased with the scent and have found Healing Solutions brands to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter/beginner essential oil blend.  I am quite oily, own many brands, have favorites, and have used long enough to be able to speak fluently enough about the quality of an oil.  This one is almost for sure mixed with a V6 oil instead of being 100% Vetiver oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t necessarily a terrible thing, since all essential oils should be applied topically with a carrier oil to prevent rashes, burning, etc especially with hot oils.  However, as an owner of 50+ 100% essential oils that I mix with a V6 myself, I am pretty sure based on smell, viscosity and even color that this is mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver is a calming oil, and this brand is no different.  The scent is usually described differently by each person using it, but I like to describe it as a green smell, or a peanut butter-y smell.  It works well to promote calm or help calm before bed, and it works even better when blended with other calming oils.  Must have for every mother!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle and am offering my unbiased opinion. I was not familiar with Vetiver Essential Oil. I did some brief research. It has a number of uses both internal and external, though the bottle states &amp;#34;not for internal use&amp;#34;. I have dry skin from tanning so I put some on my arms and legs. The grassy scent takes a little getting used to but is not unpleasant and smells natural. The Vetiver Oil moistened my skins immediately and made it feel softer. I feel that it is beneficial though I&#x27;d have to use it for a longer period of time to be sure.</li>
            <li> Sweet grassy earthy woodsy scent. The first bottle I purchased did not have the liquid smoke scent to it, the second bottle very much had the liquid smoke scent. So there seems to be some batch inconsistency. Thick amber colored oil. Using it as the deep note in cologne.</li>
            <li> almost 70% of the oil I get from them all started to smell rancid after 2 months of purchase.  I would do no star if there&#x27;s an option...</li>
            <li> love this oil. earthy. really does feel calming.</li>
            <li> a light oil with faint scent...ok...but would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Compared to Young Living this is the next best thing. I use YL all the time and want to try these. I am not disappointed at all. I would purchase again and service is great.</li>
            <li> I like this essential oil. Got it for concentration and it seems to work well so far. I only wish the smell was slightly more potent. Some may like that aspect tho . . .</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with other oils to see if it would help my great-grandson with his ADD and school work. I have not yet had a chance to see if it works, just hoping.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it a few nights for our 4 year old, 2 drops rubbed on her feet. She is sleeping so much more peacefully! She was waking up 5+ times a night for the last several weeks. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It smells good. I haven&#x27;t used it for much yet but it seems to help keep my skin clear when I apply a few drops with my face lotion or some coconut oil before bed. I gave it to a friend to try on her son who has ADHD but is too young to medicate yet. I don&#x27;t know if that worked. Will have to add to this after I hear back from her.</li>
            <li> There is very little odor to the product. I was expecting to find it more fragrant. The size is also very small- 10cc is not very much. I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It seems to help my six year old focus a bit better in school. And he seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Got my bottle on time, maybe a little earlier.  I am very happy.A lot of the recipes I will be using call for Vetiver, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Just received the oil, it has NO SCENT AT ALL...NADA!! It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Have used it a couple of times and really like the results so far.</li>
            <li> This is  an amazing Essential oil! I was going to get juniper oil, but decided to get Vetiver first. I have had pain in my neck for several months. It is at its worst when I sleep. I usually get a stabbing pain when I lift my head of the pillow to turn to the other side. But I have had 3 nights without the pain, which has made my days better. I mix drop with lotion and apply.Heaven Can&#x27;t wait to try juniper!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this oil to use in a blend (with lavender and cedarwood) to help my son  focus during his studies. This oil has a grassy scent that reminds me of walking into a pet store. It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all. I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with focus issues at all (yet?), but it is a wonderful oil for skin healing, diluted in coconut oil with some lavender.</li>
            <li> great shipping delivered as promised</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the other Vetiver oils I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere, barely any hint of odor. It was much thinner and lighter in color.  The bottle was labeled Vetiver but is far inferior.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son with ADHD calm down. I put drops on the bottom of his feet (as I read to do on different blogs)&lt;br /&gt;I saw no difference in his mood or behavior.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying though.. It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Never smelled vetiver before but If this is what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like YUM!!! So earthy and fresh :)</li>
            <li> Great oil, great price!</li>
            <li> Favorite new oil...will be buying again</li>
            <li> absolutely zero scent, very thick, appears to be new and unopened so obviously the product is a dud, just noticed a few other recent reviews that were very negative..I am just wishing I could return mine, do not purchase from this lot anyway...I purchase many EO&#x27;s online, this is my first negative experience, NOW is a decent brand..</li>
            <li> Smells great!  I mix it with lavender sometimes.  But this one really works well along as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Good quality too.</li>
            <li> Put it in carrier oil for better healing.  Smells different.</li>
            <li> Love this oil is great value!</li>
            <li> It smells like wet soil.  I have no use for it.  So it sits in my closet. UGH!</li>
            <li> Nice vetiver.  Not too spicy, not too gloopy.  Drips with a few taps.  Very very good and calming when diffused at night.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very earthy smell to it, almost like dirt, but I still enjoy it. The oil is a great quality and I have purchased several others from this company. It blends well with other oils and carriers. I usually use it in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I used this with other oils for a mood stabilizer. It works great and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Very manly scent, used in a beard  oil recipe for my bf</li>
            <li> As anticipated. Thanks.</li>
            <li> this is awesome for muscles and surgery!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good  the seller had fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not even close to what vetiver should smell like.  Well, a tiny bit. I&#x27;ll stick to Aura Cacia Products.  The doTerra oils are good also, but the prices are almost double to what Aura Cacia&#x27;s are.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Using in diffuser for teen son with ADD, he likes the scent.</li>
            <li> Love It. Very Earthy, And A Slight Twist Of Sweet Balance. But Not Too Much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Very Much Recommend You Add This To Your Collection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEARD APPROVED</li>
            <li> This is the thickest essential oil I&#x27;ve ever used!  Tap your finger on the dropper to get it going.  Light woodsy scent.  Very calming when rubbed on the back of your neck.  Not as strong as Valerian, at least not on me.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son who has ADHD, i kept reading online that is calms and focuses the mind. I believe it does. Earthy scent. I apply it to the back of his neck in the morning, sometimes I will add some more in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as this oil is portrayed to do</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help me relax and sleep. I&#x27;ve used it every night for one month and I have not noticed any difference in my difficulties with falling asleep. The aroma is not pleasant or unpleasant - it reminds me of something but I haven&#x27;t figured out what yet.  I will continue to use - I&#x27;m thinking in a diffuser during the day might help with my anxiety/stress.</li>
            <li> i love vetiver, vut this one is just kind of yuck. seems very low quality.</li>
            <li> Another top essential oil by Healing Solutions, recommend.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Love this oil- not really the smell (kinda like pipe tobacco) but I mix it with Lavender and we inhale or difuse or mix topically.  It makes grandkids calm and sleep all night</li>
            <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting. This vetiver, although describes itself as being &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, is not as thick as I&#x27;m used to. The kind I like (which is no longer available) is THICK like molasses. This vetiver is much more liquidy, you can in fact dispense it through the restrictor cap without issue. Also the smell is off. I think this is because its not aged very long.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this will sit on a shelf in the bathroom while I look for another alternative.</li>
            <li> THis may not be your NAME brand oil manufacture, but the quality is great!!  I have enjoyed all my oils from Healing Solutions and I will most definitely purchase more oils from them.</li>
            <li> I love vetiver, and I use it daily in layering with other essential oils. It is very calming and soothing, and the price for this is very reasonable. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> You put a drop on a piece of paper...in the next day or so if there&#x27;s still an oily spot, the product was diluted with a carrier oil... Healing Solutions brand did NOT pass the test. So pissed I wasted my money 😡</li>
            <li> Great essential oil quality.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Smells awful, it&#x27;s quite watery, not viscous like true vetiver oil should be. Do not waste money on this oil</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see the benefits as of yet.  Maybe I just prefer my essential oil company that I have tried before this company, but my does not sell this oil.</li>
            <li> Not sure if smell is correct since it is first time to buy this EO. but didn&#x27;t like the smell. Trying to decide if I should return or if it just smells like that.</li>
            <li> Ok I will admit I was drawn in by all the remarks about how unique and wonderful this product smelt.....so with no knowledge of how it smelt at all I ordered it.....oh my gosh! it&#x27;s terrible....if it does have any health benefits no one is this house will be finding out because I could never diffuse it or apply it topically....it smells like liquid smoke and butt</li>
            <li> Nice oil! I&#x27;m not a fan of Vetiver but have to use it for different things. This one smells better than most others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this brand of essential oils and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in the quality of the product. I have been committed to the Young Living brand but I feel their product line is overpriced. This brand is affordable quality. ..I love that</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Very good for a lot of things.</li>
            <li> Not as potent as what I got from Edens garden.  Works... but works slower.  It&#x27;s cheaper but that&#x27;s not the point. I bought it for efficacy more than price.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a great price!!!  Smooth transaction &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> The oil I got was stale.  Must have been several years old.  Think old cooking oil smell.  Just bad.  Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Working very well....Helps me to relax and fall asleep......The smell is addicting....like it,great stuff!</li>
            <li> Not happy with my purchase.  Received the bottle with a weird sappy film coming out of the top.  It did not look open though.  Shipped out quickly.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! High quality. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Smells great,  high quality</li>
            <li> Smells woodier than DoTerra Vetiver, but once its on your skin it mellows. Also smells great diffused. Very earthy.</li>
            <li> nothing but scented carrier oil!</li>
            <li> Earthy scent that I use together w organic fractionated coconut oil to make my own mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> Great oil, mixed it with a few other ones I have. The smell if off putting, but when its mixed its good.</li>
            <li> Relaxes my child who has Autism. It&#x27;s okay I guess.</li>
            <li> Everything about the order went very smoothly. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I dab on my wrists before bed....I took the plastic stopper/dripper out as impossible to get anything to come out of it.  Works great for me and I like the woodsy smell which is gone by morning.</li>
            <li> I love vetiver! A drop rubbed onto the bottom of each foot lets me sleep much better than I used to! I&#x27;ve shared vetiver with others and they are happy to have found it as we&#x27;ll. I also mix it with a carrier oil in a roller bottle and apply it to the back of my neck in the morning, and I feel less testy with other people. And that&#x27;s good for everyone!</li>
            <li> Label doesn&#x27;t say organic. It smells AWFUL!</li>
            <li> i am using this with apricot oil to reduce infection fr radiation burns..working wonderfully</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to write an honest review.  Do not care for scent but it sure helps me sleep when diffused!</li>
            <li> Good smell, but not great. Very thick, but I knew this going in! Seems to make me a bit more &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality oil that will be great for making essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> This oil, which should have  a very strong, rich earthy scent, arrived with NO aroma at all. Even when applied undiluted to a tissue to smell, there was no discernible scent. I am left wondering if it is adulterated or out of date. I will never purchase anything from this company again as I no longer trust the quality.</li>
            <li> Came on time,smell very nice. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Great smelling essential oil. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> like this essential oil very well.</li>
            <li> Okay this is Part One of a 2 part Review. I had not heard of this product. I received an Email asking me to Order (they made it completely free) and Review it. I am like many, and thought it could be a fake email and wouldnt &#x27;click the link&#x27;. Id also Never gotten such a request before. I looked it up on here, then I tracked down the Company and sent them the email to see if it was &#x27;real&#x27;, It Was, and they were Incredibly Helpful! There was an issue and I couldn&#x27;t respond to the original email address. It is NOT for internal use, its for Topical massage or a diffuser to make your house smell good. I have chronic pain, and have finally ordered this. Cant hurt to see if it helps. I am BIG on how a company helps you, they were Easy to reach and Fantastic to deal with. When I receive the product I will let you know how it works/smells.    PART TWO OF REVIEW: The oil arrived very fast, it indicates its not for internal use. I have been giving it a few days to make sure my findings are correct, and it appears to be Very useful in treating Whiplash of the neck! I am not experiencing the pain or stiffness thats usually holding me back from everyday activities, like riding the bus to get things done. I use a glove to apply, so it doesn&#x27;t soak into my fingers instead. Ive been frustrated by the drip tube, I dont know if thats just to keep it from leaking? But have EASILY removed it with a set of needle-nose pliers. It keeps anything from leaking, so if I travel, Ill reinsert it. The introduction to this product out of the blue has given me an interest in more types of this particular plant. I am scent sensitive, big time, and the smell is very faint out of the bottle, earthy yes, and doesn&#x27;t trigger any negative side-effects, nor does the oil its self seem to cause any breakouts. I am a sensitivity disaster and would recommend this as SAFE for ALL. If I can handle it, it&#x27;s highly unlikely anyone else would have any issues.     I have included pictures of the bottle, the packaging, and the plastic insert drip tube or stop leak thing I removed.    I dont have a diffuser, but am interested in such now...    If you get the chance to review their products Take It! or if you&#x27;re just looking for last ditch pain relief of tight swollen mussels Grab it!  Great company and Product!    Part 3... My Father has Carpal Tunnel, the first I know of this, in the mornings he cant make a fist. This can last all day, now for the first in ages he says-he woke with NO Issue in that hand after a night time application, his neck isnt bothering him either, and he had to sleep on a couch no less last night due to the holiday and not being home! So this product seems to be the answer to different kinds of pain! I know my nerve pain from the neck injury in both my hand and foot have abruptly stopped since the use of this began. When I miss a day or two of use it comes back.</li>
            <li> Great quality, and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> stinks at first....but helped my foot</li>
            <li> I love this oil. One drop on the bottom of your big toe and you will sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we&#x27;ve tried vetiver oil, and so far we&#x27;re liking it very well.</li>
            <li> Bottle was open and leaked all over package. These bottles just don&#x27;t open themselves. Disappointing.  Not even worth the hassle of sending back.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....ORGANIC need I say more. Happy Happy Happy!</li>
            <li> Bought for me, my husband immediately loved the smell and has taken this for his own daily post-shower dab.  I love how the smell seems to warm up and diffuse a bit with body heat.  It&#x27;s outdoorsy and subtle and grassy.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Smells great but this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve received that was filled less than 3/4 of the way</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product and had to re-order</li>
            <li> I diffuse this nearly everyday and I love it! The smell isn&#x27;t to strong and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Love this oil to relax and chill!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, quite like peanuts..would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love the smell and the way it makes me feel!</li>
            <li> gosh best sleep ever!!!!! double hurray</li>
            <li> Out of ten years of buying vetiver it has never been this runny. It was a waste of time and money to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Practically no aroma whatsoever.  Seemed like a watered down version.  I should have realized that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> There is a reason the price is cheap. Didn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ll stick with doterra</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for. Good quality, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> so far so good! Arrived in perfect shape and scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. I needed vetiver for some essential oil combinations and this will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells good and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product at all. It&#x27;s only 10 percent vetiver essential oil. Was very disappointed. Nowhere in the description did it say that it was diluted. Now I have to buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; affordable</li>
            <li> Sid not luke it at all.</li>
            <li> A heavenly scent! Helps me relax after a stressful day at work! :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  I read online that this had a citrus type scent to it.  To me, it doesn&#x27;t smell that way at all.  It has kind of a woodsy, smokey type scent.  Not really bad though.  I have never smelled Vetiver before so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I like it and it will go well in my Oil recipes.  This was also one of the best deals I found on this oil.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my young son who was diagnosed recently with ADHD. We started using it just last night in a diffuser at night and again today during nap time. We also have a swatch of fabric with the oil on it for him to keep in his pocket. I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell if the oil is having an impact on activity-level and concentration but it definitely seems to help with sleep! He rarely takes a nap and today with the diffuser on, he was out within minutes of laying down! Excellent price point! If you&#x27;re curious about the oil...this is definitely the place to try it out!</li>
            <li> nice and strong scent, great for my base note in my diy perfume.</li>
            <li> hope it really works for keeping kids focused on homework!</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery and great package.</li>
            <li> We just bought Vetiver (Organic) Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10ml, Ylang Ylang (Organic) Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10ml, Bergamot (Organic) Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10ml, and Geranium Egypt (Organic) Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10ml. Of those four, only the geranium had any real scent or potency. The ylang ylang and veiver had a weak to low-moderate smell, and the bergamot? Couldn&#x27;t even smell it. I suspect there was repackaging here. My wife ordered these for various purposes - mostly health-related. She is new to EOs and was excited at the prospect of moderately-priced oils with such good reviews. However, we won&#x27;t be buying the Healing Solutions brand again.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite natural plant essences ever. very reasonable price, good quality. no leakage during shipping, packed very well - though it was a rather bigger box than necessary for one little bottle of essential oil.... padded envelope would&#x27;ve worked just as well, I&#x27;d think. Less waste. Good customer service, quick delivery. Will order from this company again. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> A drop on bottom of big toes and I sleep like a baby</li>
            <li> “*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.”&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the sweet, earthy aroma of this oil. I like to use it with Lavender oil in a mist in the bedroom to help me sleep happy. I am not disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li> Have been trying oils from different companies as I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  This is the first from Healing Solutions.  I love the Vetiver.  I am very satisfied with how quickly it was shipped, the packaging was excellent, and the prices are affordable.  I have another of their oils called Petitgrain.  I am equally happy with this one as well.  Will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> excellent would buy again</li>
            <li> i just opened the bottle of vetiver and i love the earthy smell,can,t wait to use it. i,m waiting for other oils for my mixtures. to be delivered.  it,s exciting to read about all the herbs. and oils that GOD has put here for us</li>
            <li> It has very little scent and the little it does have stinks. Not sure if this is how it&#x27;s suppose to be or not. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; very reasonably priced. Chose because of Prime 2 day free shipping.</li>
            <li> This oil is horrible.  It has no scent at all.  The dispenser does not even allow drops to come out of the bottle.  This was a terrible purchase.</li>
            <li> Still early to see if it&#x27;s going to help</li>
            <li> Just started using the oil. Seems to be working. Really hasnt been long enough yet</li>
            <li> It seems to be working pretty well for sleep. A couple of drops on soles of feet, and a bit under my nose, I have been sleeping deeper. Some nights, I wake up anyway, but usually put more on and back to sleep! I like the smell, and have compared it to one twice the price, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> So far it is working great.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; product as well</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Got fast and is exactly what I needed. Used in a mix for nighttime to help sleep.</li>
            <li> I read that Vetiver is liquid Xanax but after using it for several days, I don&#x27;t feel that way….I just smell like a hippy, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is not the best but ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Product states that it&#x27;s 100% pure, but what it doesn&#x27;t tell you is what percentage of the solution is pure. There is NO WAY that this oil is 100% pure oil.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes, and that&#x27;s when you can get it out of the bottle!!!  Something about that little spout inside the bottle causes vapor lock and product won&#x27;t drip out.&lt;br /&gt;I realize this oil is about 1/3 price of other oils, but do yourself a favor and save your money and buy the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> essential oils are awesome</li>
            <li> It may smell earthy, woody, and exotic to Westerners, but to me and my family, it smells exactlyy like Eastern Asian oriental medicine. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the oriental medicine smell. But this may be the most heavenly essential oil to those who really like the smell of oriental medicine.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, but then again most essential oils are. I was having trouble sleeping at night and heard that vetiver helps. I used this before I went to bed the first night I had it and I slept like a rock!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, smells pure.  The only downside of this is that it is difficult to get the dropper to work.  I have another bottle from the same company (tea tree) and that pours just fine.  I think this just might be slightly defective.</li>
            <li> We use it for our child&#x27;s ADHD to control the anxiety. He enjoys the effect it has on him and the quality of this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to help grandchild to focus and so far while using this at home it seems to work pretty good.  May need a little long to make a final observation.  We actually like the grassy woodsy fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing,great for pain relief. My grand children sleep better after I rub their feet with it before bed.</li>
            <li> Oil tested to be fraudulent. Highly adulterated. Disappointed that I can&#x27;t get a refund even though I just found this information. Don&#x27;t use therapeutically, please.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Fast shipment!!</li>
            <li> Small, but works well, therapudic grade</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for a sleep aide. I mix with lavender and chamomile with a carrier oil in a roller ball and apply to my feet at night....amazing!  All of my oils are from Healing Solutions and they are all wonderful!</li>
            <li> Received in great condition</li>
            <li> So excited to start using this product. It is clearly a quality essential oil.  I&#x27;ve never used vetiver before, but believe it has the qualities mentioned in my research of the product. I will be combining with other oils to make a a calming mixture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how pure this essential oil is nor what the true quality is. It says 100% pure therapeutic grade but I&#x27;ve also read that, that is just a made up quality to use on any essential oil. There is no ingredients list on the bottle so you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s mixed with another oil. Also the dropper cap is too small, or tight, for such a thick oil. You&#x27;re better off taking it off and using a squeeze dropper to dispense the oil. The bottle also doesn&#x27;t tell you how the oil was extracted, which would be nice to know since some methods can damage or ruin the purity of the oil. As for the price and quantity of it... Great price for the amount of oil you get. The smell is kind of light for an essential oil which makes me iffy on how pure it is. All things considered I&#x27;d probably do some research on this company before buying from them again. But as a first time buyer I&#x27;m a little less than pleased.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product quality as listed</li>
            <li> Just like the one from Doterra.. not even kidding</li>
            <li> Very nice and authentic smell, but unlike the other oils the smell is faint.</li>
