            <li>The Maybelline liner is awesome.</li>
            <li>The price is awesome</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to benefits eyeliner gel pen.</li>
            <li>My experience is to look like a raccoon, lol.</li>
            <li>The gel liner is great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own because it always transfers onto my lids but not with this one!</li>
            <li>I guess I needed more practice to reach the perfect wing.</li>
            <li>Its a really good eyeliner</li>
            <li>You have to use a good eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and quick service.</li>
            <li>Great product, took some getting used to, but I like it better than Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the benefit one that&#x27;s very popular.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I love it and think all my fellow gel-liner girls should try it!</li>
            <li>The staying power is amazing, I used it on my waterline, and it didn&#x27;t budge all night.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Best purchase ever works amazing and cam way early</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, easier than liquid gel, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is amazing, much better than the Benefit Push Up Liner.</li>
            <li>Make sure to have an oil based makeup remover to take this baby off.</li>
            <li>there is much more time to work with it on</li>
            <li>you can layer much better.</li>
            <li>so you end up pumping out more than you need so that can be a pain</li>
            <li>i love this liner</li>
            <li>but the more you use it you get better.</li>
            <li>I enjoying seeing my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t go away when my eye itches.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I like the texture better than the Benefits product.</li>
            <li>the rubber tip is way better than a brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly Maybeline&#x27;s version has a much smoother formula making it easier to apply.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as i&#x27;d like to, but i feel like that&#x27;s part of the learning curve.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth waiting to arrive from London to United States!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a cheaper option of Benefit and it works great on waterline, which is what I use it for.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly, and the color is really intense.</li>
            <li>I love it so simple to use</li>
            <li>It took me couple minutes to figure out how to get the gel to the tip when I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re real!</li>
            <li>It last forever, doesn&#x27;t smear much and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>Hands down my new favorite liner!</li>
            <li>Plus much cheaper.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Push up gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I was using benefit gel liner which applies crumbling and drys to fast.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also very pigmented</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but still smudges after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Bought it in Japan a few years ago, and fell in love with right away.</li>
            <li>I also received the eyeliner pretty quickly for an internationally shipped product.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite eyeliner of all time.</li>
            <li>It also makes for less flaking, and the color is much more pigmented.</li>
            <li>i have the benefit push up which is three times more expensive the maybelline the formula is much better</li>
            <li>Once I was able to master it (you won&#x27;t regret it), you won&#x27;t want to go back to the traditional eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Extremely creamy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that the applicator is funny</li>
            <li>Benefit has almost the same exact product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t run and completely smudge proof, once it dries.</li>
            <li>it takes a lot of getting used to as far as using--</li>
            <li>The shape of it is good for a thicker cat-eye but a more subtle one can get a little frustrating.</li>
            <li>At first it was hard to handle because of the &amp;#34;ruberish &amp;#34; tip and trying to figure how much girl was enough to use.</li>

            <li> It goes on much smoother, very black, and waterproof.</li>
            <li> It came in a couple weeks earlier than what the expected delivery date was.</li>
            <li> and I got it earlier than expected so</li>
            <li> i put a small glob on the back of my hand for one eye, apply, another for the next eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to make a straight line</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s expected and to me</li>

            <li> this will not budge on the waterline, though i can&#x27;t say for all day, it stays for longer than any other eyeliner i&#x27;ve used on my waterline-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find this product because in the U.S. I believe there&#x27;s only in Japan and Singapore (?).</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is the tip takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I use it on upper eye line only and it doesn&#x27;t stay for the whole day, even after I applied a base.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> its matte pitch black and this formula</li>
            <li> It took me couple of tries to get enough practice to understand the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; behind its technology.</li>
            <li> Another drawback is this product is not available in the U.S.</li>
            <li> sometimes you have to click it a few times</li>
            <li> not more this formula does that.  </li>
            <li> really hard to control the application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to eyeliners because I hate having to retouch my makeup throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it&#x27;s really slow</li>
            <li> I usually used gel liner with a thin brush like a sigma E5</li>
            <li> It creates a dramatic look, although I tried to make the infamous wings to a unsuccessful achievement.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t use setting powder after you&#x27;re done putting on the eyeliner, it will smudge unfortunately.</li>
            <li> so the angled tip was weird to use.</li>
            <li> the wait time wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> I love it so simple to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to eyeliners because I hate having to retouch my makeup throughout the day. This eyeliner is amazing, much better than the Benefit Push Up Liner. Hands down my favorite eyeliner of all time. Extremely creamy and easy to use. I could never use gel liner on it&#x27;s own because it always transfers onto my lids but not with this one! It stays on all day and does not budge whatsoever. Make sure to have an oil based makeup remover to take this baby off. Shipping was fairly quick. It came in a couple weeks earlier than what the expected delivery date was.</li>
            <li> It is very different than using a pencil or liquid gel. It took me couple minutes to figure out how to get the gel to the tip when I used it the first time. I just need to turn the other end to the direction where the arrow points to until I see the gel coming out. It is very easy to apply, easier than liquid gel, in my opinion. I use it on upper eye line only and it doesn&#x27;t stay for the whole day, even after I applied a base. Maybe the reason is my creases are not as deep (I&#x27;m Asian). Another drawback is this product is not available in the U.S. It takes a while to get here from Japan. However, I like the ease of application and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> i have the benefit push up which is three times more expensive the maybelline the formula is much better there is much more time to work with it on you lid then the benefit which dries in two secondsand its matte pitch black and this formula you can layer much better. i have oily lids and have monolids so my eyeliner needs to be bullet proof and not more this formula does that.  the only thing is that the applicator is funny sometimes you have to click it a few times and sometimes it&#x27;s really slow so you end up pumping out more than you need so that can be a pain but when that happens i grab a liner brush and use it that way. this is my holy grail i love this liner</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever works amazing and cam way early</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product. The staying power is amazing, I used it on my waterline, and it didn&#x27;t budge all night. It didn&#x27;t disappear into eternity, this is almost the same thing as the Benefit gel liner pen, the applicator is a bit getting used to. If you didn&#x27;t use setting powder after you&#x27;re done putting on the eyeliner, it will smudge unfortunately. Other than that, it&#x27;s a cheaper option of Benefit and it works great on waterline, which is what I use it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to make a straight line but the more you use it you get better.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to benefits eyeliner gel pen. It goes on much smoother, very black, and waterproof. Plus much cheaper. Its a really good eyeliner but i still.havent gotten the hang of it! Would have given it a 4 but customer service was great!</li>
            <li> I love it! At first it was hard to handle because of the &amp;#34;ruberish &amp;#34; tip and trying to figure how much girl was enough to use. It took me couple of tries to get enough practice to understand the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; behind its technology. Once I was able to master it (you won&#x27;t regret it), you won&#x27;t want to go back to the traditional eyeliner. I enjoying seeing my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t go away when my eye itches. It creates a dramatic look, although I tried to make the infamous wings to a unsuccessful achievement. I guess I needed more practice to reach the perfect wing. I do not use it, nor suggest doing it, to line your lower eyeline. My experience is to look like a raccoon, lol. I prefer to use it in the upper eyeline and let mascara take care of the lower line. Besides, the upper line makes your eye look bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will continue buying this product. It&#x27;s worth waiting to arrive from London to United States!</li>
            <li> The rubber tip takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s an amazing product. I usually used gel liner with a thin brush like a sigma E5 so the angled tip was weird to use. It glides on like liquid liner but stays put all day. I also received the eyeliner pretty quickly for an internationally shipped product. Awesome product and quick service.</li>
            <li> A dupe for Benefit&#x27;s they&#x27;re real! push-up eyeliner. I really love this product. Bought it in Japan a few years ago, and fell in love with right away. Glides smoothly, and the color is really intense. It&#x27;s so hard to find this product because in the U.S. I believe there&#x27;s only in Japan and Singapore (?). Anyway, try it, and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> really hard to control the application.</li>
            <li> I like the texture better than the Benefits product.</li>
            <li> Great product, took some getting used to, but I like it better than Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real Push up gel eyeliner. Surprisingly Maybeline&#x27;s version has a much smoother formula making it easier to apply. It also makes for less flaking, and the color is much more pigmented. Love it! Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to order from Japan.</li>
            <li> The gel liner is great.  I was using benefit gel liner which applies crumbling and drys to fast.  The Maybelline liner is awesome.</li>
            <li> Hands down my new favorite liner! It&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t run and completely smudge proof, once it dries. You have to use a good eye makeup remover. The only negative thing I can say is the tip takes some getting used to. The shape of it is good for a thicker cat-eye but a more subtle one can get a little frustrating. But it is gel so that&#x27;s expected and to me the rubber tip is way better than a brush. All-in-all, I love it and think all my fellow gel-liner girls should try it! I saw an ad for it a while back but then never heard of it again or saw it in stores(and I checked a lot of stores). Benefit has almost the same exact product but it&#x27;s about $25, which I almost gave into until I found this. The price is awesome and I got it earlier than expected so the wait time wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but still smudges after a few hours.</li>
            <li> WHY don&#x27;t we have this in the US??! I love it. It&#x27;s even better than the benefit one that&#x27;s very popular. It last forever, doesn&#x27;t smear much and is easy to control. it&#x27;s also very pigmented</li>
            <li> it takes a lot of getting used to as far as using-- i put a small glob on the back of my hand for one eye, apply, another for the next eye. this will not budge on the waterline, though i can&#x27;t say for all day, it stays for longer than any other eyeliner i&#x27;ve used on my waterline- it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as i&#x27;d like to, but i feel like that&#x27;s part of the learning curve. i use an oil-based remover, and it comes off in a snap.</li>
