            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite smelling bod product.</li>
            <li>He always seems to like scents that get discontinued, so it was great to find this at reasonable cost through a site we could trust.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on the way it smells on me than anything I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>, many complements from girls</li>
            <li>I was not quite sure about this product until I started using it.</li>
            <li>I am planning to buy two more.</li>
            <li>sure smells</li>
            <li>This Bod body spray has to be my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>great smell fresh and cool.  </li>
            <li>They are all VERY different from one another, but yet they all have a very pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you DO get a lot in this bottle, and it lasts me a long time for a great price!!!</li>
            <li>telling me how good i smelled worth the price , cheap mens spray.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine got me a sample pack and of the 3 scents, this one by far is my favorite, and the ladies love it too!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, and great price.</li>
            <li>If you want a unique, fresh, and trendy fragrance you will love this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a musk, so the smell is non-feminine, yet not overly strong.</li>
            <li>This is nice musky smell and it is very crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>i got this shipment but with a lil delay but its fine</li>
            <li>A light scent but one that doesn&#x27;t go away after 12 hrs.</li>
            <li>MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
            <li>Always complimented when I wear this scent ever so lightly, and people still notice and ask about it.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great fresh spray for kids!&lt;br /&gt;going to school, going to church, playing outside with friends, baseball games &amp; hanging out!</li>
            <li>Not such a pleasant musky scent as the musky scent one would find at a spa.</li>
            <li>super fast everything came good and new product</li>
            <li>Maybe someone will read this and then send to super wal-mart.</li>
            <li>I feel super good&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li>an amazing smell that really isnt matched by its price and quantity given, i really wouldnt go any where without a spritz of this on anymore.</li>
            <li>Great, long lasting, appealing fragrances, and economical.  </li>
            <li>But this Blue Musk is really pleasant, not overpowering and not weak.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, love the size, though wish the spray handle was a little more controllable on how much you want to put on yourself.</li>
            <li>This discontinued-in-stores spray is my adult son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>sometimes it smells like fresh laundry</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying several brands cologne on and off for years, and for some reason this cheap stuff always has gotten the most positive feedback among women.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many compliments I get about the smell of this fragrance, Fresh Blue Musk.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and have had many compliments from women.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Also there are many blends by the same BOD</li>
            <li>Just got the product in the mail and it smells terrific, cant wait to try it out tomorrow morning. :)</li>
            <li>I first got it a couple years ago, but didn&#x27;t start using it for a while.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok especially if you work out at the gym, will keep you from stanking of sweat.</li>
            <li>The Blue Musk is our FAVORITE...</li>
            <li>I had doubts when I first bought a BOD sample pack.  </li>
            <li>Though the smell last much longer then Axe does, and I think it smells better too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>the sprays are so different but all the same in that they last and smell great</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how could it spread with such light</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>cheaper else where, smell refreshing not strong , last most of the day, after shower and shave</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this scent than any other I have ever worn.    </li>
            <li>I expected light perfume given how the bottle looks, and it was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>However, it wears off very quickly, I&#x27;ve learned that I must reapply in the middle of the day, and in the morning I need to apply a bit more than other colognes in order to make it apparent</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well worth the low price</li>
            <li>highly recommend it and use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great but too expensive to order.</li>
            <li>I found Parfums De Coeur Fresh Blue Musk Body Spray</li>
            <li>B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]] which matches it.  </li>
            <li>B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I love it and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>It smells ok but it won&#x27;t last long !</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m beating all of the hot chicks off with a big ol stick now.</li>
            <li>Comments are always positive from those close enough to smell.</li>
            <li>I always fear that something will break, but it&#x27;s still fine after a round trip.</li>
            <li>I feel like i&#x27;m being drenched in the stuff if I spray it on directly, to help control it</li>
            <li>These products are for after shower/bathing and last you much longer than spray on types.  </li>
            <li>Complete ripoff</li>
            <li>I have been using this products for years and buy it frequently.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this spray unless you a old man.</li>
            <li>This spay smells like a old man</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32 year old and will never spray this on my bod....</li>
            <li>This musk scent will make you think you&#x27;re sniffing an old corpse.</li>
            <li>My personal preference is the \\&quot;fresh blue musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s not gonna be as good as expensive cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a number of other sprays and this particular brand of BOD has received hands down the most number of compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year and keep getting compliments at social gatherings.  </li>
            <li>EVERY FEW MONTHS AND FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>This is hard to find, but worth the hunt.</li>
            <li>It is big (has good amount of liquid and is not an aerosol), bulky and sprays badly.</li>

            <li> I expected light perfume given how the bottle looks, and it was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> However, it wears off very quickly, I&#x27;ve learned that I must reapply in the middle of the day, and in the morning I need to apply a bit more than other colognes in order to make it apparent</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well worth the low price</li>
            <li> highly recommend it and use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but too expensive to order.</li>
            <li> I found Parfums De Coeur Fresh Blue Musk Body Spray</li>
            <li> B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]] which matches it.  </li>
            <li> B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I love it and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It smells ok but it won&#x27;t last long !</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m beating all of the hot chicks off with a big ol stick now.</li>
            <li> Comments are always positive from those close enough to smell.</li>
            <li> I always fear that something will break, but it&#x27;s still fine after a round trip.</li>
            <li> I feel like i&#x27;m being drenched in the stuff if I spray it on directly, to help control it</li>
            <li> These products are for after shower/bathing and last you much longer than spray on types.  </li>
            <li> Complete ripoff</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for years and buy it frequently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this spray unless you a old man.</li>
            <li> This spay smells like a old man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old and will never spray this on my bod....</li>
            <li> This musk scent will make you think you&#x27;re sniffing an old corpse.</li>
            <li> My personal preference is the \\&quot;fresh blue musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s not gonna be as good as expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a number of other sprays and this particular brand of BOD has received hands down the most number of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year and keep getting compliments at social gatherings.  </li>
            <li> EVERY FEW MONTHS AND FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> This is hard to find, but worth the hunt.</li>
            <li> It is big (has good amount of liquid and is not an aerosol), bulky and sprays badly.</li>
            <li> becoming a little hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; and as such it will not last very long on the body.</li>
            <li> Smell don&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overpowering as long as you use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> even if they were the Bodman gave them the excuse to do so,  I&#x27;m sold,  I even have the matching aeresol</li>
            <li> Aside from countless other brands, I&#x27;ve tried all of the Bod-Man body spray fragrances.</li>
            <li> Kind of makes me feel stupid for getting these gifts like a $38 bottle of Gucci</li>
            <li> i think ill get Really Ripped Abs next.</li>
            <li> I got it way before the expected time frame for delivery.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I purchased this product on line because it has become difficult to find on the store shelves..</li>
            <li> I feel that the scent is weak and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> bottle is not handy, especially in a bag.</li>
            <li> I almost have the feeling it has been watered down.</li>
            <li> I like it as a little spritz of fragrance after a shower or in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on aerosol products which run out after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> PRETTY BAD</li>
            <li> Just a few small sprays on your clothing will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve worn CK,Coolwater, Gucci, Halston, etc.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years but its difficult to find in stores so switched to ordering online.</li>
            <li> spending mosts of money on name brand spray that were overpowering and expensive</li>
            <li> Half of the scents are just terrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Aksed many times what it was that I was wearing because it smelled so good - very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; and as such it will not last very long on the body. I like it as a little spritz of fragrance after a shower or in the morning before work. I like the scent and can only find it online now.</li>
            <li> smells like a pervert</li>
            <li> This is a great fresh spray for kids!&lt;br /&gt;going to school, going to church, playing outside with friends, baseball games &amp; hanging out!</li>
            <li> I didnt even reiceve this. All I got was the box and it was open from the back. The seller didnt even try helping me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great smell and the women love it as well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is like the commercials but it is a nice smelling product that the ladies compliment me on.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites scents by BOD. I seem to always be getting complimented on the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have had many compliments from women.</li>
            <li> Since I started wearing this I get comments all the time! The price is great as well!</li>
            <li> Of the BOD fragrances this is the best. Scent similar to \\&quot;4711\\&quot; and lasts longer.  &#x27;many compliments received!</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used as far as body spray&#x27;s and cologne&#x27;s go. I&#x27;ve worn a number of other sprays and this particular brand of BOD has received hands down the most number of compliments. There is something in this formula that makes women comment on how nice you smell... no joke!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying several brands cologne on and off for years, and for some reason this cheap stuff always has gotten the most positive feedback among women.  I mean I&#x27;ve worn CK,Coolwater, Gucci, Halston, etc. alot of the top name brands, and for some reason I always get comments from women telling me how great it smells and asking me what it is, no joke...  Kind of makes me feel stupid for getting these gifts like a $38 bottle of Gucci pour homme when this is a fraction of the price and has gotten me more comments than anything.</li>
            <li> Love the  smell ! I got these for my hubby</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more compliments on this body spray then anything else I&#x27;ve ever worn. Aside from countless other brands, I&#x27;ve tried all of the Bod-Man body spray fragrances. They are all VERY different from one another, but yet they all have a very pleasant odor. My personal preference is the \\&quot;fresh blue musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff smells good girls love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like citrus or floral notes. Some musk colognes have such under notes but not this one. This is nice musky smell and it is very crisp and clean. There&#x27;s no harshness to it. A light scent but one that doesn&#x27;t go away after 12 hrs. It just lingers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off just for the bottle. It is big (has good amount of liquid and is not an aerosol), bulky and sprays badly.</li>
            <li> Smell don&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much. Just right. Comments are always positive from those close enough to smell.</li>
            <li> I used this before all the time, &amp; women would always compliment me on it. They would be like \\&quot;oh my god, what are you wearing?\\&quot; or \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot; nice compliments like that. It&#x27;s a refreshing smell. That&#x27;s why I decided to buy it again. Great product. Buy it you&#x27;ll definitely get compliments from women.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m beating all of the hot chicks off with a big ol stick now. this stuff smells so very nice.</li>
            <li> I love the product, love the size, though wish the spray handle was a little more controllable on how much you want to put on yourself. I feel like i&#x27;m being drenched in the stuff if I spray it on directly, to help control it I spray it on my hands then wipe in on me. Though the smell last much longer then Axe does, and I think it smells better too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smelling bod product. A friend of mine got me a sample pack and of the 3 scents, this one by far is my favorite, and the ladies love it too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for years... becoming a little hard to find.  I&#x27;ve had a million compliments on my \\&quot;scent\\&quot; and have always refused to tell anyone what it is.  Great stuff and not $50 an ounce.</li>
            <li> Great, long lasting, appealing fragrances, and economical.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on aerosol products which run out after a few uses.  These products are for after shower/bathing and last you much longer than spray on types.  Amazon has the very best prices out there.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years. I get more compliments on this scent than any other I have ever worn.    My highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but too expensive to order.Could not find in local store.Maybe someone will read this and then send to super wal-mart.</li>
            <li> This product smells great!  I cannot tell you how many compliments I get about the smell of this fragrance, Fresh Blue Musk.  Just spritz it on under your clothes in the morning and you&#x27;ll smell great all day.  This product rivals the more expensive colognes you may already be wearing.</li>
            <li> good stuff but cheaper else where, smell refreshing not strong , last most of the day, after shower and shave</li>
            <li> Great service and a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> super fast everything came good and new product I feel super good&lt;br /&gt;recommend will be purchased till the next purchase</li>
            <li> BEWARE SMELLS LIKE 75% IS WATER COMPARED TO BOD BOUGHT AT THE STORE, I ORDER THIS EVERY FEW MONTHS AND FIRST TIME I WAS EMBARRASSED AS MY GIFT SMELLED DILUTED AND CHEAP....!! PRETTY BAD IF THEY ARE DILUTING FOR 10.00</li>
            <li> an amazing smell that really isnt matched by its price and quantity given, i really wouldnt go any where without a spritz of this on anymore.</li>
            <li> This discontinued-in-stores spray is my adult son&#x27;s favorite. He was thrilled to get it quickly and nicely packed for product protection. It was exactly what we wanted. He always seems to like scents that get discontinued, so it was great to find this at reasonable cost through a site we could trust. When in doubt, try Amazon!</li>
            <li> this might be the one u would never change your mind about it.smells great and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> My fav BOD scent.  Buy it every time I run out.  I get more compliments on the way it smells on me than anything I have ever worn.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> great smell fresh and cool.  Best of all the price is right. Also there are many blends by the same BOD</li>
            <li> Used to be a great cologne. Been using it for years but its difficult to find in stores so switched to ordering online. Ever since I started buying it online the scent lasts maybe an hour  or so. They are definitely doing something different to it. Complete ripoff</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. It smells great, lasts all day and fairly inexpensive. Always being asked what cologne do I have on. Always getting complimented. An awesome product.</li>
            <li> Just got the product in the mail and it smells terrific, cant wait to try it out tomorrow morning. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It was given as a present to my husband. He likes it.</li>
            <li> For years I searched for a spray that would last throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;I went to the big dept stores . spending mosts of money on name brand spray that were overpowering and expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Parfums De Coeur Fresh Blue Musk Body Spray&lt;br /&gt;and have NEVER looked back&lt;br /&gt;all the sprays are so different but all the same in that they last and smell great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trust me ....they are great smelling sprays</li>
            <li> Great product that you can&#x27;t buy in store</li>
            <li> What can i says it smells good and don&#x27;t smell like cheap Cologne i will be buying more of bod perfumes i think ill get Really Ripped Abs next.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. I get compliments all the time when I wear this cologne! However, it wears off very quickly, I&#x27;ve learned that I must reapply in the middle of the day, and in the morning I need to apply a bit more than other colognes in order to make it apparent I&#x27;m wearing something by the time I get to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you DO get a lot in this bottle, and it lasts me a long time for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
            <li> Always complimented when I wear this scent ever so lightly, and people still notice and ask about it.</li>
            <li> good smell , many complements from girls telling me how good i smelled worth the price , cheap mens spray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past purchased in stores. This was the first time I purchased this product on line because it has become difficult to find on the store shelves.. I feel that the scent is weak and does not last very long. I almost have the feeling it has been watered down. I&#x27;m back to buying it in the stores when I can find it</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s not gonna be as good as expensive cologne. You get what you pay for, but for the price, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great! I get compliments for it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest products I have ever bought. I get a lot of compliments on it. I have been using this products for years and buy it frequently. But will buy it from this seller from now on. Super fast shipping, and great price. I got it way before the expected time frame for delivery. Extremely pleased customer here! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> For me this is one of those every day type of sprays. It&#x27;s not too overpowering as long as you use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this spray unless you a old man. This spay smells like a old man I&#x27;m a 32 year old and will never spray this on my bod....</li>
            <li> I was not quite sure about this product until I started using it. It&#x27;s really good. I am planning to buy two more.</li>
            <li> i got this shipment but with a lil delay but its fine i finaly tried this fragrance after so many years so good sometimes it smells like fresh laundry i think am gonna order a dozen lol</li>
            <li> My son and grandson love this stuff..smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Not such a pleasant musky scent as the musky scent one would find at a spa. This musk scent will make you think you&#x27;re sniffing an old corpse.</li>
            <li> smells great and its from bod which is good for men great for working and going out strong and smells great good one of the list of them</li>
            <li> Bodman Blue Musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a woman call me \\&quot;the good smelling man\\&quot; yesterday.  I had this on and the [[ASIN:B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]] which matches it.  If you want women to think of you as \\&quot;the good smelling man\\&quot; maybe you should use it, too, but not too many of you, and then I wouldn&#x27;t be exceptional anymore,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  August, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:January, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had three different women stop and ask me what I waswearing  \\&quot;It sure smells good!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they were hitting on me , but , even if they were the Bodman gave them the excuse to do so,  I&#x27;m sold,  I even have the matching aeresol [[ASIN:B00066OHQG Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk 4 oz Deodorant Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This Bod body spray has to be my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve owned. I first got it a couple years ago, but didn&#x27;t start using it for a while. Now I love it and use it almost everyday. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores though so I had to order it from here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Always a great buy, clean and fresh and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Great product from reliable source</li>
            <li> Shipped and received with no problems and in a timely manner. Smell is ok especially if you work out at the gym, will keep you from stanking of sweat.</li>
            <li> The compliments are constant, everyone asks what he is wearing.  They can&#x27;t believe it when we tell them.  The Blue Musk is our FAVORITE... I buy 3 at a time!</li>
            <li> I expected light perfume given how the bottle looks, and it was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;What made me more satisfied, is that everyone noticed it and also noticed from fair distance and also noticed how light it is! I don&#x27;t know how could it spread with such light scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is not handy, especially in a bag. I always fear that something will break, but it&#x27;s still fine after a round trip.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s a musk, so the smell is non-feminine, yet not overly strong.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for someone and it smells awesome. Fast shipping and well worth the low price</li>
            <li> Bod is a good very good product, but Fresh Blue Muck smells great. This is hard to find, but worth the hunt.</li>
            <li> Its OK but not perfect ! It smells ok but it won&#x27;t last long ! For this price I would rather buy (4 ) Axe or playboy body sprays  !</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that makes &amp;#34;panties drop&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere.  If you want a unique, fresh, and trendy fragrance you will love this.  I had doubts when I first bought a BOD sample pack.  Half of the scents are just terrible!  But this Blue Musk is really pleasant, not overpowering and not weak.  Just a few small sprays on your clothing will do the trick.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year and keep getting compliments at social gatherings.  Give it a shot1</li>
