            <li>Great product and not at all damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my curly hair and this is hands-down the best I have found    </li>
            <li>I had used it for months and loved the results</li>

            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>THIS IS AMAZING SERVICE...</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this was still available online.  </li>
            <li>and my hair shakes out into nice looking waves after being up in a twist.  </li>
            <li>So if you want it fast, this is perfect!</li>
            <li>Was very upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so very happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that really can&#x27;t be found in stores in my area anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>but I am happy that it got to me so fast and it works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>It helps retain the waves I do have and it gives definition/waves to the top layer of my hair that is flattened by many years of straightening every day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my hair to make it wavy without it feeling rock-hard, and none have worked better than Sunsilk.</li>
            <li>This gives me better curls (ringlets), it is not crunchy and my hair still has body.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product : )  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find this on-line.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair care gel and has been for years.</li>
            <li>I want a more youthful and curlier look.  </li>
            <li>The gel and cream combination produces beautiful natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this one, due to its great reviews and good price.</li>
            <li>It is good on humid days or just anytime you want just the right wave and does not look greasy or full of gel.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was a cream instead of a spray- easier to put it where you want, with the right amount on each spot.</li>
            <li>my hair is a little damp from the shower &amp; put 1 or 2 pumps in my hands and run it through my hair - perfect!!!     </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon and the shipping was FAST!  </li>
            <li>Sunsilk is great for long hair and holding waves.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth a try for everyone with curly/wavy and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>hairspray on and, \\&quot;voila!\\&quot;, my hair looks great, my hubby loves it, and I didn&#x27;t even have to brush, blow dry, etc!</li>
            <li>I bought it based on reviews I read - they were so right!</li>
            <li>Leaves the curls in nice ringlets and doesnt make it crunchy like so many other products.  </li>
            <li>My order was delivered very fast!  </li>
            <li>It smelled nice, but did the exact opposite of the stated text.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been so hard for me to find a good product to manage my very light, very wavy hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom to many kiddos and have forever been \\&quot;all ears\\&quot; for a hairstyle that seemed impossible to find: one that doesn&#x27;t require any work but still looks great!</li>
            <li>Well, a magazine article recently talked about the sexy \\&quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret\\&quot; hair you see on their models.</li>
            <li>First I want to thank you for the fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to receive my order so fast!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and I&#x27;m pleased with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I tried the bun thing as mentioned in the first review, and that worked well for my hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I blow dry with a diffuser and scrunch it, if I want more curls and waves.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a different product years ago which was fabulous.</li>
            <li>It made my daughters hair very silky</li>
            <li>After they discontinued in stores, I have not found any product that is able to create soft, defined, frizz-less curls without the crunchy, wet look!  </li>
            <li>What makes this product so unique is that it also works on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>to completely de-frizz my normally very frizzy hair and sculpt it the way I want it.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I spray my hair with plain water until damp, put a dab more Waves of Envy on it, comb through with a wide-toothed comb and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Live in a humid area and frizz is not an issue when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty frugal, so I started searching for similar products on Amazon and found this.</li>
            <li>My hair actually looks better on the 2nd or third day after washing while using this every day.    </li>
            <li>Then I just put my hair in a bun on top of my head and in the morning I take it down and let the rest air dry (takes just about 20 minutes while I&#x27;m getting the kids ready for school).</li>
            <li>It leaves you with soft manageable curls or waves and is never stiff or crunchy like some gels.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and de-frizzed enough that I have gone from work straight to out for the evening</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised each time I have ordered to receive my order within a week...</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and I hoped to use this to sculpt/shape the wave.     </li>
            <li>My hair has some natural waves and body and this stuff helps to make the waves stand out if I want them to or tamed if I want them to do that, or quite curly if that is my desire.</li>
            <li>Makes curls soft and defined.</li>
            <li>I have a natural wave to my hair and this product enhances it on days</li>
            <li>Smooth into my wet hair and let it dry naturally.    </li>
            <li>I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, but this works to put my hair in pretty loose waves.</li>
            <li>Well, apparently it can be achieved with sea salt-type hair products.</li>
            <li>Having natural curly/wavy hair, I used to buy this product all the time at local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>It only take one little squirt (don&#x27;t put too much in!)</li>
            <li>My hair comes out very beachy looking, and with a little shine spray and maybe taking the curling iron to a strand or two, this truly is \\&quot;red carpet\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> HOWEVER, my friend tried the same bun technique with her very fine hair, and it came out frizzy and with awkward curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but everything else either leaves my hair limp, too crunchy/hard or frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I have been searching for something new that actually works for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> I live on Guam, so I usually expect things to take awhile getting here.</li>
            <li> No sticky or stiff residue, just soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Other Amazon storefronts short take lessons from you!  </li>
            <li> When discontinued at my local store I had to hunt it down to order online.    </li>
            <li> And this isn&#x27;t based on one usage - I used half of the bottle before I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.     </li>
            <li> I put a dab on my wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick hair, and usually products like these are a lost cause for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I could no longer find it in stores but was so excited to see it here!</li>
            <li> I mean, it was a total shapeless, heavy blob of hair, whether I diffused and scrunched, put my hair in a bun, put my hair in braids, or tried to airdry.</li>
            <li> Then I put just a little bit of FLEXIBLE (read: non-crunchy, unstiff)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very hard to find and different prices.</li>
            <li> No more wasting time doing my hair</li>
            <li> Thank you for using my shipment money correctly, and not putting my order on the slow boat to Guam...</li>
            <li> Sadly evenutlly I will have to find another product.</li>
            <li> The product recommended was too expensive for this mom: about $22.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish that they didn&#x27;t stop making this product, can&#x27;t find anything similuar that is affordable. Sadly evenutlly I will have to find another product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really can&#x27;t be found in stores in my area anymore.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon and the shipping was FAST!  TYVM!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so hard for me to find a good product to manage my very light, very wavy hair but this cream gel was my last stop.  It only take one little squirt (don&#x27;t put too much in!) to completely de-frizz my normally very frizzy hair and sculpt it the way I want it.  What makes this product so unique is that it also works on dry hair.  When I am at work and have to go out afterward, I simply run into the ladies&#x27; room, throw some in my hair and it instantly looks professionally-done.      Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth a try for everyone with curly/wavy and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my curly hair and this is hands-down the best I have found    When discontinued at my local store I had to hunt it down to order online.    Leaves the curls in nice ringlets and doesnt make it crunchy like so many other products.  Smooth into my wet hair and let it dry naturally.    Live in a humid area and frizz is not an issue when I use this product.  Cant seem to find anything else that comes close</li>
            <li> This cream is the best!  Makes hair wavy , but not sticky. I&#x27;ve tried many products, and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a mom to many kiddos and have forever been \\&quot;all ears\\&quot; for a hairstyle that seemed impossible to find: one that doesn&#x27;t require any work but still looks great! Ha! Well, a magazine article recently talked about the sexy \\&quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret\\&quot; hair you see on their models. You know, the \\&quot;I just got out of bed and still look sexy\\&quot; look? Well, apparently it can be achieved with sea salt-type hair products. The product recommended was too expensive for this mom: about $22. I&#x27;m pretty frugal, so I started searching for similar products on Amazon and found this. I liked that it was a cream instead of a spray- easier to put it where you want, with the right amount on each spot. So I got it and have to say it&#x27;s wonderful! I take a shower at night, put 2-3 pumps of this on my palms and use my fingers to untangle any knots while working the product through. Then I just put my hair in a bun on top of my head and in the morning I take it down and let the rest air dry (takes just about 20 minutes while I&#x27;m getting the kids ready for school). Then I put just a little bit of FLEXIBLE (read: non-crunchy, unstiff) hairspray on and, \\&quot;voila!\\&quot;, my hair looks great, my hubby loves it, and I didn&#x27;t even have to brush, blow dry, etc! Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset that this item is being discontinued but I am happy that it got to me so fast and it works wonders on my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used on my straight/wavy hair.  It helps retain the waves I do have and it gives definition/waves to the top layer of my hair that is flattened by many years of straightening every day.  I just put this product in and go, as a mom of 3, I LOVE it!!!  No more wasting time doing my hair this lets me do the wash &amp; go.</li>
            <li> Hello!  First I want to thank you for the fast delivery!  I was amazed to receive my order so fast!  I have had awesome service with your company and wish to continue buying from you.  I live on Guam, so I usually expect things to take awhile getting here. I was pleasantly surprised each time I have ordered to receive my order within a week...THIS IS AMAZING SERVICE...Other Amazon storefronts short take lessons from you!  Thank you for using my shipment money correctly, and not putting my order on the slow boat to Guam...I am truly in awe of the service you have provided me on 2 occasions....believe me when I say, I will continue to order from this seller...and this product is my favorite hair product ever!  defines my curls without the crunch!    Seller- OTCMASTER ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and I hoped to use this to sculpt/shape the wave.     My hair has never been flatter or straighter than when I used this product. I mean, it was a total shapeless, heavy blob of hair, whether I diffused and scrunched, put my hair in a bun, put my hair in braids, or tried to airdry. And this isn&#x27;t based on one usage - I used half of the bottle before I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.     It smelled nice, but did the exact opposite of the stated text.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my hair to make it wavy without it feeling rock-hard, and none have worked better than Sunsilk. Was very upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so very happy that I was able to find it on Amazon. And it comes in a pack of 3, doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> I used to use a different product years ago which was fabulous. they stopped making it and I have been searching for something new that actually works for at least 5 years. I finally found it with this product.     I have naturally curly hair but everything else either leaves my hair limp, too crunchy/hard or frizzy. This gives me better curls (ringlets), it is not crunchy and my hair still has body. I can use it every day - even on days i don&#x27;t wash it - my hair is a little damp from the shower &amp; put 1 or 2 pumps in my hands and run it through my hair - perfect!!!     It isn&#x27;t expensive and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. My hair actually looks better on the 2nd or third day after washing while using this every day.    I bought it based on reviews I read - they were so right! it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Sunsilk is great for long hair and holding waves. It is good on humid days or just anytime you want just the right wave and does not look greasy or full of gel.</li>
            <li> I constantly wear my hair up for work, and I always try to put in a moisturizing cream and gel.  This product combines those two in one, and saves me a step in the morning and clears up a bit of space on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and de-frizzed enough that I have gone from work straight to out for the evening and my hair shakes out into nice looking waves after being up in a twist.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and I&#x27;m pleased with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick hair, and usually products like these are a lost cause for my hair. I thought I&#x27;d try this one, due to its great reviews and good price. I tried the bun thing as mentioned in the first review, and that worked well for my hair. HOWEVER, my friend tried the same bun technique with her very fine hair, and it came out frizzy and with awkward curls. My hair comes out very beachy looking, and with a little shine spray and maybe taking the curling iron to a strand or two, this truly is \\&quot;red carpet\\&quot;. One of th best things about this order was the shipping. I simply used standard shipping, and even though it was coming across the country, it arrived in 2 days. So if you want it fast, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> My hair has some natural waves and body and this stuff helps to make the waves stand out if I want them to or tamed if I want them to do that, or quite curly if that is my desire. I put a dab on my wet hair after shampooing. I don&#x27;t brush or comb, just run my fingers through it. In the morning I spray my hair with plain water until damp, put a dab more Waves of Envy on it, comb through with a wide-toothed comb and that&#x27;s it. Sometimes I blow dry with a diffuser and scrunch it, if I want more curls and waves.  For a total straight look, I blow-dry and style with a round brush. Love it.</li>
            <li> Having natural curly/wavy hair, I used to buy this product all the time at local drug stores.  Several years ago it became unavailable and I thought it was no longer manufactured.  To my surprise, I found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately.  This product is great!  It leaves you with soft manageable curls or waves and is never stiff or crunchy like some gels.  I would recommend this product to anyone with wavy or curly hair.  Love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product : )  So glad I was able to find this on-line.  Thought it was gone forever!  My order was delivered very fast!  Makes curls soft and defined. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this was still available online.  After they discontinued in stores, I have not found any product that is able to create soft, defined, frizz-less curls without the crunchy, wet look!  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair care gel and has been for years. I was really disappointed when I could no longer find it in stores but was so excited to see it here! I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, but this works to put my hair in pretty loose waves.</li>
            <li> I have a natural wave to my hair and this product enhances it on days I want a more youthful and curlier look.  Great product and not at all damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li> The gel and cream combination produces beautiful natural curls.  No sticky or stiff residue, just soft bouncy curls. A must try!</li>
            <li> I was given Sunsilk waves of envy by my hairdresser. I had used it for months and loved the results no frizz and my hair was manageable even in humid weather and then of course I ran out and could not find it anywhere. Finding it on amazon was a plus so I ordered three!</li>
            <li> It made my daughters hair very silky and she loves it. It&#x27;s also very hard to find and different prices. I think it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
