            <li> I smelled this cologne and fell in love with it. I purchased a bottle as a gift, but ended up keeping it and use it as my come get me scent... it&#x60;s daring, but quite sensual on a women. I love to challenge men and I&#x60;m very feminine, so it makes me feel sexy and playful. If someone recognizes the scent even better - he could start to wonder where did i spend the night...(wink, wink) Got tons of compliments on it</li>
            <li> Great cologne!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the chemical reaction it has on body.  This process enhances its warm fragrance and can be worn in both the summer and winter.  I prefer to use in the winter as it gives a warmth scent.  It is a classy scent and one does not need to wear too much of it to get an all-day-lasting effect.  But this has a lot to do with how one&#x27;s body reacts to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommend it to skip using it from time to time as the body will/may NOT react the same giving its unique fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended.</li>
