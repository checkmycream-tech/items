            <li> I loved the fact that this product came to my house very quickly from me ordering it. Ive been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for this mist and found it on Amazon . The price was pretty reasonable . My only complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long . Only a few hours at the most . I use the body lotion , the body mist and the perfume .</li>
            <li> You should try this fragrance, it&#x27;s very soft and it&#x27;s a great scent for the winter you and you Boo will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume the first time from Victoria Secrets, I wanted to buy it again but was told it only came out at xmas time. I was very happy to find it on Amazon to buy it (and so was my husband). The party I bought it from was very helpful and the shipping was way faster than they had said it would be.  Will buy from them again. The fragrance is hard to explain but everytime I wear it people tell me I smell soooo good. And my husband must think so too cause he never leaves my side.</li>
            <li> Smells like senior perfume .</li>
            <li> The Basic Instinct Sheer Mist is a great product that leave you smelling fresh and good.  It make people wonder what you are wearing.</li>

            <li> i would rate this item the highest score +++++ Excellent product and I turn head every time I wear it</li>
            <li> This mist is a great value! I get lots of compliments when I wear this along with the body lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just by the description..... It turned out to be a nice scent... I love how it smells after its been on for a few minutes.... Nice soft scent....</li>
            <li> Great product fast service. Will order again. Would recommend to friends and family for sure. If you need this product this is the place to go</li>
            <li> spells more like a man&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li> Wish they would make this again. Smell if very pleasant</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite one. I wish I could afford the perfume instead of the mist.</li>
            <li> I love this, the smell is so refreshing</li>
            <li> My wife loves the fragrance of the mist and has being using it for quite a while and will continue to use it. She buys several bottles at a time so she never runs out and usually orders when she&#x27;s on her last bottle.</li>
            <li> Received my package and love it! My only complaint is that the bottle wasn&#x27;t boxed or bubble wrapped.. The bottle was leaking and the inside was wet, other than that I love love the smell of this product of Victoria Secret!</li>
            <li> And its a nice smell, lite and Not over powering. Easy to be around almost relaxing. If you buy it she Will like it :o)</li>
            <li> I have been driving at least 75 miles one way to find this perfume, but on a whim, I checked Amazon.com.  Love it!! I didn&#x27;t go anywhere and it was cheaper than in the store!!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this scent. My boyfriend absolutely LOVES it as well. Great scent! Great price, just get it!</li>
            <li> Submitted a return for this product, but was told to keep it...I did NOT like anything about this scent. I would not have even used it in my bathroom...I am sure many of their scents are captivating,  but from now on I will try them out in stores first!</li>
            <li> I am a perfume Junkie. I love it. I used to sell perfume oiis back in the 90&#x27;s, so I have had the opportunity to try many, many fragrances...but THIS ONE!!! It&#x27;s perfect for me. Very soft, subtle, and clean fragrance. That&#x27;s what I love. I also ordered the body lotion. I found that by layering the two, the fragrance lasts all day and I could even smell it the next morning.  I appreciate the professionalism in careful packing and shipping every item that I have ever ordered from Amazon. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product is awesome.  My wife loved it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that amazon had my favorite perfume.  I was so mad that they discontinued my favorite purfume, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that smell similar to this, and now I can get it here.  I had my perfume in 3 day.</li>
