            <li>If you are looking for any kind of light skin stuff don&#x27;t go for it....</li>
            <li>Light weight  </li>
            <li>This made my skin feel nice and smooth, but it didn&#x27;t help as much as the Kojie San soap, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love this cream it does exactly what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li>It is a nice cream that aids in diminishing the appearance of fine facial lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely did anything for my skin, I been using the product for over 5 weeks and no difference and the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Did not have much creme</li>
            <li>&amp; I Really Didnt See A Change</li>
            <li>Does not seem to be doing much but will continue to use until gone and see if the area lightens.</li>

            <li>Besides its natural whitening effect this cream also doubles as a moisturizer which means this is all I&#x27;ll ever need for my facial care routine.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 3 wks. and have seen no difference.  I don&#x27;t think it works.  Will not reorder</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it compliments the soap, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the soap so I use it as a moisturizer. My only complaint is that the jar is super small for what I paid for it. Other than that, I like the cream itself so far.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week for my face and neck and I did not see any changes and this  itsi  bistsi jar (2 small for me and my money)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again ....voila.</li>

            <li> I Been Using This Cream For About 2 Months Now &amp; I Really Didnt See A Change In My Skin Tone.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to be doing much but will continue to use until gone and see if the area lightens.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.</li>

            <li> My wife loves it and we didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li> I like using this face cream.  It does compliment the Kojie San soap.  The cream slowly brightens and evens the skin.

            <li> Great product! It nicely gives my skin a beautiful glow. And again, it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. I will buy this over and over.</li>
            <li> 3 star because it came early didn&#x27;t really do much but, nothing bad happened, product was really small didn&#x27;t expect it to be small... If you are looking for any kind of light skin stuff don&#x27;t go for it....</li>
            <li> It only lightens when used in conjunction with the soap...</li>
