    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The jar was raved as the BEST gift on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is the best!</li>
            <li>Good quality and perfect size.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It is a great quality.</li>
            <li>Great jar.</li>
            <li>Since I have taken up the hunt and purchase of vintage safety razors, I also give them a good Barbicide bath before use for piece of mind.</li>
            <li>Nice jar, just like the barber shops use.  </li>
            <li>Works great and it was exactly what I wanted / paid for!</li>
            <li>Gives my bathroom counter a nice feel and looks way better than dropping my combs in a cup.  </li>
            <li>nice basket to bring everything to the top.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for; Long combs, scissors, trimmers and more!  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34; vintage look &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The jar has a leak and there was disinfectant sitting on top of the</li>
            <li>The laminate is now separating on the cabinet from the barbicide sitting on top overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a cheaper jar, and it was flimsy and even dented on the lid when I got it, but the lid on this one is thicker and heavier and much better quality.</li>
            <li>So F for customer service, but I like the item for sure.</li>
            <li>The size if perfect for all of our combs, and the support tray neatly prevents any smaller objects from falling to the bottom of the</li>
            <li>I love this jar.</li>
            <li>Waited for delivery more than a week.</li>
            <li>love the jar though.</li>
            <li>Then pull the brush out and rinse with hot water and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>and now I always have a clean comb!</li>
            <li>; brush it won&#x27;t fit in the jar with the metal holder and top.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true!</li>
            <li>Sits on my station for easy access.  </li>
            <li>I tried to buy a cheaper version and it broke so quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made cheaply, either.</li>
            <li>This was recommend by my sister and it great for sanitizing the bathroom and hair products with multiple people in the house.</li>
            <li>Nice size can that was very helpful.</li>
            <li>but the lid is bent and won&#x27;t fit on correctly.</li>
            <li>I can easily fit my clipper guards and blades at the end of the day to disinfect.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it will not be functional as arrived.</li>
            <li>I also keep my beard/moustache comb clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li>I cut my friends&#x27; and family member&#x27;s hair, so I need to keep my equipment clean and sanitized.  </li>
            <li>love the height, and the glass is nice and solid.</li>
            <li>What can I say, this thing just looks cool.</li>
            <li>Good solid container with a rubber (removable) ring on bottom for stability...</li>
            <li>Filled one with disinfectant and set it on our new shampoo cabinet in our salon.</li>
            <li>so I opted for the larger jar and love it.</li>
            <li>i used my friends, and when you put your tools in it they all bump edges so its better to use a flat plastic box, put your cleanin soution</li>
            <li>is good enough it should last for years.</li>
            <li>do not use it with the liquid, as Barbicide has not yet responded to my question as to whether it is safe to store the items long term.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about this jar - it holds a good amount of items, feels sturdy, looks good, and has a nice rubberized base to help protect it.  </li>
            <li>I added this to my shaving den (bathroom sink) and it certainly adds a degree of nostalgia to the d√©cor.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have had a certain scent to it</li>
            <li>this jar is smaller than what is used in the salons, as it won&#x27;t even fit a rat tail comb.</li>
            <li>My combs keep falling off to the side and either getting stuck underneath or wedging the whole thing in place</li>
            <li>very convenient and functional.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely nice and heavy duty</li>
            <li>i there for ten minutes, and wipe clean with a cloth.</li>
            <li>I cycle through many different safety/straight razors and disinfect them at the end of a cycle before moving onto the next.</li>
            <li>issue I had with the jar, is that the paper packaging on top was is screwed so tightly</li>
            <li>Lid is really thin metal and looks cheap even at a glance, but the overall look is nice.</li>
            <li>The glass is nice and thick though.</li>
            <li>Although this jar is more expensive than some of the others, in this case, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The jar looks a lot bigger than I remember seeing in the barber shop, but does exactly what it is suposed to do.</li>
            <li>I had absolutely no problems with packaging and shipping, it arrived quickly and in one piece.</li>
            <li>How does an average person, who doesn&#x27;t work in a salon, clean their combs and bushes?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes an old guy smile, as it&#x27;s the same you remember from your younger barber shop visits.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I purchased this jar, along with King Research&#x27;s Barbicide Disinfectant, as a bit of a joke: I wanted the bathroom where I cut my children&#x27;s hair to have the look of a professional salon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know this until I just asked her because I was going to complete the inquiry</li>
            <li>has an excellent base, removable and rubberized.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The tray in the bottom leaves a pretty wide gap around it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a well made item and has become an integral part of my new career as a stay-at-home-part-time-stylist.............</li>
            <li>glass is thick and sturdy and the metal lid fits securely over the jar.</li>
            <li>Though it was hard to find, this barbicide jar was worth every penny.</li>

            <li> Works great. Love the &amp;#34; vintage look &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this jar - it holds a good amount of items, feels sturdy, looks good, and has a nice rubberized base to help protect it.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality and perfect size.</li>
            <li> this jar is smaller than what is used in the salons, as it won&#x27;t even fit a rat tail comb.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these. Filled one with disinfectant and set it on our new shampoo cabinet in our salon. The next&lt;br /&gt;day I walked into a complete mess. The jar has a leak and there was disinfectant sitting on top of the&lt;br /&gt;cabinet overnight. The laminate is now separating on the cabinet from the barbicide sitting on top overnight. For&lt;br /&gt;a $18.00 junk jar I ruined a $500 shampoo cabinet. Both of these jars are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son, he enjoys it, it&#x27;s hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes an old guy smile, as it&#x27;s the same you remember from your younger barber shop visits.</li>
            <li> This jar is sturdy and well made. It has a rubber bottom as well. I&#x27;ve ordered a cheaper jar, and it was flimsy and even dented on the lid when I got it, but the lid on this one is thicker and heavier and much better quality. Although this jar is more expensive than some of the others, in this case, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my brother. I was skeptical of the label on the jar, but it adds to the barbershop appeal of the jar. The jar was raved as the BEST gift on Christmas morning. It&#x27;s not made cheaply, either. It is a great quality.</li>
            <li> Was horribly packed with NO padding and arrived in a million pieces. Pretty sure it will not be functional as arrived. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The jar looks a lot bigger than I remember seeing in the barber shop, but does exactly what it is suposed to do.</li>
            <li> Gives my bathroom counter a nice feel and looks way better than dropping my combs in a cup.  It is heavy with thick glass walls and very well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it with the liquid, as Barbicide has not yet responded to my question as to whether it is safe to store the items long term. So F for customer service, but I like the item for sure.</li>
            <li> Sits on my station for easy access.  After using a comb you just drop it into the Jar to be disinfected.</li>
            <li> The tray in the bottom leaves a pretty wide gap around it. My combs keep falling off to the side and either getting stuck underneath or wedging the whole thing in place and I have to stick my hands in the Barbicide to fish them out. The glass is nice and thick though. Lid is really thin metal and looks cheap even at a glance, but the overall look is nice.</li>
            <li> This was recommend by my sister and it great for sanitizing the bathroom and hair products with multiple people in the house. It&#x27;s a must in any bathroom</li>
            <li> I added this to my shaving den (bathroom sink) and it certainly adds a degree of nostalgia to the d√©cor. It reminds me of the barbershop my dad to me to as a kid. I have the room so I opted for the larger jar and love it. I cycle through many different safety/straight razors and disinfect them at the end of a cycle before moving onto the next. I also keep my beard/moustache comb clean and sanitized. Just remember, this is not made for storage, only sanitation - don&#x27;t let your items sit in it longer than the recommended 10 minutes as per the Barbicide instructions. Since I have taken up the hunt and purchase of vintage safety razors, I also give them a good Barbicide bath before use for piece of mind. It&#x27;s made of heavy glass and is built sturdy. I had absolutely no problems with packaging and shipping, it arrived quickly and in one piece. What can I say, this thing just looks cool.</li>
            <li> It is extremely nice and heavy duty</li>
            <li> Product as described (just like in salons) and now I always have a clean comb!</li>
            <li> Nice jar, just like the barber shops use.  I cut my friends&#x27; and family member&#x27;s hair, so I need to keep my equipment clean and sanitized.  I have a station set up in a spare bedroom in my house and having this jar among my other equipment makes my set-up look legitimate.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I purchased this jar, along with King Research&#x27;s Barbicide Disinfectant, as a bit of a joke: I wanted the bathroom where I cut my children&#x27;s hair to have the look of a professional salon. Anyway, what started as a joke has since turned in a frequently-used, essential item. The size if perfect for all of our combs, and the support tray neatly prevents any smaller objects from falling to the bottom of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass is thick and sturdy and the metal lid fits securely over the jar. Overall, this is a well made item and has become an integral part of my new career as a stay-at-home-part-time-stylist.............</li>
            <li> Good solid container with a rubber (removable) ring on bottom for stability... Works as intended and quality is good enough it should last for years.</li>
            <li> I love this jar. It has rubber on the bottom so it won&#x27;t slip off the counter.  How does an average person, who doesn&#x27;t work in a salon, clean their combs and bushes?  I have friends who put them in the dishwasher, yuck!  I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  One thing to note if you have a wide, 3&amp;#34; brush it won&#x27;t fit in the jar with the metal holder and top.  I remove the metal piece and put the brush in for 10 minutes. I close the bathroom door so my cats can&#x27;t go in there.  Then pull the brush out and rinse with hot water and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> very convenient and functional.  I like it</li>
            <li> Nice size can that was very helpful. I thought it would have had a certain scent to it but it&#x27;s regular so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift. I did not take it out of the box and look at it before giving it to my daughter. I didn&#x27;t know this until I just asked her because I was going to complete the inquiry but the lid is bent and won&#x27;t fit on correctly. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I can easily fit my clipper guards and blades at the end of the day to disinfect.</li>
            <li> As always, as expected!</li>
            <li> Waited for delivery more than a week. Other than that got what expected.</li>
            <li> Works great and it was exactly what I wanted / paid for!</li>
            <li> Though it was hard to find, this barbicide jar was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Classes up my bathroom.  Kids like it as well.</li>
            <li> one i received split like a fox in a henhouse.&lt;br /&gt;yes, it broke in the mail. so i&#x27;d have to give very little points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also i used my friends, and when you put your tools in it they all bump edges so its better to use a flat plastic box, put your cleanin soution i there for ten minutes, and wipe clean with a cloth.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy a cheaper version and it broke so quickly! This is the best! Tried and true!</li>
            <li> Great jar. love the height, and the glass is nice and solid. has an excellent base, removable and rubberized.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had with the jar, is that the paper packaging on top was is screwed so tightly, I can&#x27;t possibly get it all off. I used an exacto and got the majority of the paper off eventually, but it was a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;still love the jar though.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for; Long combs, scissors, trimmers and more!  nice basket to bring everything to the top.</li>
