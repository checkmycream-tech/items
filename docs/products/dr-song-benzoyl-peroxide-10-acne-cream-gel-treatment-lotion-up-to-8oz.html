            <li>It&#x27;s very effective</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and goes on very light.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It really is a good value.</li>
            <li>get yourself a good non-comedogenic moisturizer, and this product, and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li>Good customer support from Dr. Song.</li>
            <li>It can be drying until your skin adjusts so just use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>This stuff works every bit as good as the prescription stuff.  </li>
            <li>I put on the BP before bed after a good rinse of Witch</li>
            <li>It is very smooth with no grain like some do and absorbs great .</li>
            <li>It can be drying as it is very potent.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know whether the 10% would be too strong for me, but it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>That cream worked good however it was very strong or has a ingredient that started to irritate my skin over time.  </li>
            <li>I think the products made by DR Song are top quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
            <li>The gel is a perfect 10% benzoyl peroxyde and does exactly what it is supposed to: clears acne in days.</li>
            <li>I have gone through my first bottle of this and it has been the best benzoyl peroxide product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works way better than proactiv!</li>
            <li>You get a lot more product for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li>make sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff for a acne..</li>
            <li>Bottle lasts me a good 3 months before I run out, saved a lot of money and MORE EFFECTIVE RESULTS.  </li>
            <li>I used Oxy Facewash with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know, but</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t effective at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a $10 amazon gift card though.</li>
            <li>Having the pump bottle is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Every bottle that I&#x27;ve used has this problem, so you kind of have to shake it out to use it.</li>
            <li>I also really liked that it came with a 10 dollar gift card promotion.</li>
            <li>consistency of the product is nice.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice container</li>
            <li>This makes a perfect spot treatment, but it is too drying to use over your whole face.</li>
            <li>A+, great cream at a very nice price, works very well.    </li>
            <li>Great price and great results so far.</li>
            <li>Large bottle for a very good price.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Acne Cream I have used</li>
            <li>Our son says this is the best product he&#x27;s used so far.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it is effective.</li>
            <li>By far the best thing we&#x27;ve found for my daughters skin problems.</li>
            <li>This is strong stuff!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, good packaging.</li>
            <li>Good product though, works quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This is a much better price</li>
            <li>In fact I think my makeup looks better after using it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs on the skin much better</li>
            <li>I would also like to say that since using this product I can do more things to my skin and it does not break out .</li>
            <li>but most docters dont prescribe 10%.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>so i treat my skin with 10% Benzoyl peroxide cream and soap and my skin is ok now.</li>
            <li>Questions are welcomed :)</li>
            <li>better products out there</li>
            <li>better works with taking \\&quot;clearzine\\&quot; 6-8 pills</li>
            <li>The pump eliminates the many problems and looks better on your counter.  </li>
            <li>Too many words required.</li>
            <li>been using the 10% BP cream for a couple of months and the difference is night and day compared to the selection at most stores.  </li>
            <li>Although, I should have researched more about benzoyl peroxide, because it WILL stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>Love this product I use it all over my face at night and as a spot treatment during the day.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m also glad i ordered the smaller size, since it&#x27;s perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>More Dr. Song products, and this one lives up just as well as all of the others.  </li>
            <li>glad I went for it.</li>
            <li>This is the best 10% gel I&#x27;ve used, it zaps up my pimples overnight and has saved my face on multiple occassions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try  Dr. Song&#x27;s acne cream, and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>its getting better...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product</li>
            <li>I will buy again and again :) i am happy i have a very clear face now :)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has acne and it doesn&#x27;t work every time for him, but I just have normal skin with intermittent breakouts and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle was thicker and had a good pump.</li>
            <li>towels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had marginal success with the cream from Proactive but the Dr. Song product is leaps and bounds more effective.</li>
            <li>individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with the result so far!</li>
            <li>It turned out to be the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on an acne product.</li>
            <li>Goes on and soaks in very quickly</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>10% gel is strong and soaks in immediately.</li>
            <li>Also its the best price for such a large amount and you cant beat that!</li>
            <li>It is the best BP on the market hands down .</li>
            <li>It turned my mild acne into a cystic nightmare !</li>
            <li>I’ve been using the product for just over two weeks now and the results are much better than I expected and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>my skin has cleared, a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Dr. Song is smooth and inoffensive with no odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since day one of using the cream (twice a day - morning and evening), he is blemish free.</li>
            <li>I apply cream morning and night and have been 90% breakout free.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for me until the 2nd week!  </li>
            <li>Song&#x27;s BP is light weight cream that sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li>By the 3rd day, there was a noticable difference in that her acne was no longer inflamed/swollen and the redness was greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Was able to notice an improvement after the first day of use</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how many people stop and tell me how clear my skin is!!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite gel so far :)</li>
            <li>I have been ordering Dr. Songs benzoyl peroxide for a while now as it is as good as or better than any other type of BP I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get a refund because Amazon doesn&#x27;t do special handling.</li>
            <li>My first bottle of this was great, and the company essentially harassed me for a review of their product.</li>
            <li>I use a salicylic acid moisturizer which keeps my skin pretty smooth and blackhead free.</li>
            <li>I just love this product even though it&#x27;s very drying for my skin, it works, cleared up my skin in days.</li>
            <li>Loving this so far.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the fabulous reviews I thought it was worth a shot to replace my proactiv.</li>
            <li>Love the pump too - much easier to handle while applying.</li>
            <li>Great Price, but no positive results.</li>
            <li>and I will be a loyal customer from now on.</li>
            <li>Works quickly without over-drying skin.</li>
            <li>it works so much better for me than most big name brand BP treatments.  </li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and have been using it 2 times a day for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>It drys up quick</li>
            <li>a mild cleanser, this cream has already cleared the skin significantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleared me up quick.</li>
            <li>I have used proactive and neutrogena products before and noticed they weren&#x27;t very effective and pricey, Dr. Song however was very affordable and has actually made a noticeable difference with my acne.</li>
            <li>and it was working more like 70% when it was in its GOOD OLD DAYS, as of Mid 2014</li>
            <li>I fortunately still had the first bottle</li>
            <li>Very affordable compared to Proactiv, goes on light, absorbs quickly, and keeps my acne in check.</li>
            <li>so make sure you let it dry before touching skin to pigmented fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on you tube a few months ago where I heard a great review of acne.org .</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheaper, but still effective substitute and this is definitely the one.</li>
            <li>if its worth the money to you.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>Love that it is clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or sheets.</li>
            <li>Overall great product so far.</li>
            <li>Im buying another bottle right now.</li>
            <li>product itself is overall pretty effective in keeping acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dried my face out at first, but my skin adapted in a week and it&#x27;s super nice now!</li>
            <li>It peels off your skin right from the first day..</li>
            <li>but this is true of pretty much any acne product that works.</li>
            <li>It has been great about reducing red scars on my skin as well as drying up pimples that are already present.</li>
            <li>i still like this product very much, but the pump is prone to clogging.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find this product with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and minimal other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m pregnant and it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>Overall I gave this a five star because imo the exceptional results have far outweighed the negatives.</li>
            <li>had higher hopes for this product....</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot, I am still with my first 8 oz bottle but have been using it since almost october.</li>
            <li>Work very well !</li>
            <li>I actually like it much better than the Oxy product.</li>
            <li>my back is 80% better.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever felt compelled to write a review.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t give it a second look when on your shelf.</li>
            <li>bought this for one of my kids who is a chef and always in a greasy, hot cooking environment.</li>
            <li>Big fan and love the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for an over the counter acne solution.</li>
            <li>a much more efficient packaging solution would be to use a larger version of the 2oz bottle; no pump to clog up.    </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li>This is very drying, as is all benzoyl peroxide (but it has not irritated my skin).&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li>so I took out the better pump from the first bottle and used it to replace the cheaper non working pump in the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would buy again if they make it thicker and hopefully put in the better pump that actually works.</li>
            <li>Great for spot treatment and the 8 oz will also last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>i thought i would try to find an alternate container, but i&#x27;d be wasting most of the cream trying to get it out of the old, original bottle.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with Witch hazel to pretty much stop any acne from occurring.</li>
            <li>Most people here are complaining that it makes there skin dry and inflamed</li>
            <li>It is still strong enough to bleach pillows/towels</li>
            <li>But keep in mind that there were times that I just slathered this on large areas of my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Like the large size and pump.</li>
            <li>Comes in a large container for the price.</li>
            <li>the new one still clogged, but i was able to open it up with a pin - but it continued to be a problem.</li>
            <li>dr. song sent a new one out to me right away.</li>
            <li>I use it for my back acne and face, and having the option to buy a large size is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I was so excited, used it, clear acne, but left my skin super flaky.  </li>
            <li>I decided to use Dr. Song because it has few ingredients and the price for the size is an amazing deal.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work very well AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with making a return</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how much of a miracle this cream is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helped improve my body acne.</li>
            <li>Dries up the blemish really fast.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This is really drying for my skin (which is sort of the point)</li>
            <li>cream really works.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than they said it would, securely packaged as well.</li>
            <li>It did not work as well, and it was not nearly as thick as the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>have always had very oily skin and acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>It was to much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really cleared up his cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I always use it when I get an attack of red pimples and/or whiteheads and get clear skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>It dried out my face for the first few days, but honestly that’s usually a good sign for me since my face adjusts to any cream quickly and usually becomes oily again.</li>
            <li>I tried dozens and dozens of OTC and prescription products and this is the first thing that has completely gotten rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li>It immediately changes my skin from a bit rough to very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was then left with my mild acne and the scars caused by the cystic acne .</li>
            <li>Works well for my daughter&#x27;s combination skin with mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>Much better than paying ten bucks for a teeny tiny bottle of Oxy like when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite suprised, as it works better than the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>My teen had started getting mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it at night followed by a decent moisturizer then in the morning an aha lotion and moisturizer to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you used benzoyl peroxide for acne, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We still get a few pimples now and then, but they are much smaller and they disappear a lot more quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many soaps, cleansing pads and scrubs and got little or no results.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a week now, and my acne cleared up significantly, and no new pimples are appearing.</li>
            <li>Strong BP % which is great for the thicker skin of the body [not the face] but the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is actually a cream and unless you mix it with other fatty acids like your moisturizer or essential oils</li>
            <li>but that is normal with acne products</li>
            <li>i have seen remarkable improvement in my complexion: cystic acne is under control, spots are fading and my face is as soft as a babies behind.</li>
            <li>but because the second bottle I ordered was more watery, I had to take out the hair dryer and dry it before putting on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other benzoyl peroxides in the past but did not have a good reaction, so I was hesitant at first, but</li>
            <li>One dab for the left, one for the right and one for the forehead.</li>
            <li>If used daily it will clear up skin in a couple of days, but I have pretty sensitive skin, so it dries out my skin pretty severely if I don&#x27;t slather moisturizer on it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller who shared their lab test showing 10% and said they were using a new manufacturing company and working out kinks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, as it was a life saver since I had the painful kind.  </li>
            <li>Very strong will buy less % next time.  </li>
            <li>It helps with decreasing the amount of pimples you get (I get little bumps and whiteheads, not so much cysts/blackheads) , and those that have come up I have been able to extract and use this on-- it dries them right up and cuts down on redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does gradually work, so don&#x27;t expect miracles on the first application, but the second I added it</li>
            <li>am 30 year old guy, I tried everything in the world!</li>
            <li>I find my pimples do become a bit more &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; but they are usually one or two in a week</li>
            <li>first, I was a bit dubiout, since it seems that some of the reviews were/are possibly fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>clogged the first time just a short time after purchase and</li>
            <li>My first order lasted several months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only  had it for about two days now, but it is pretty watery.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is perfect for application on such a large part of the body, but I also use small amounts on a few pimples on my face (which dry out over night with this).</li>
            <li>The down side is that it really dries your skin out when using every day (can be kinda flakey, but imo the results are worth it) but</li>
            <li>As the other guy mentioned, you should not apply it more than once per day if you don&#x27;t want you skin to dry out.</li>
            <li>It helped me clear majority of my acne over months.</li>
            <li>I stopped using and it took about 2 months to clear up .</li>
            <li>Lets say it did clear 90% of my acne, and I use it also on my shoulders since I tend to have oily skin</li>
            <li>I am on my way to almost looking completely clear.</li>
            <li>This product worked well along with a benzoyl peroxide soap to clear up my keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li>my skin was this clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 Years old and have been struggling since I was 13 with acne .</li>
            <li>So if you use this on your body, wear completely white or wear something you don&#x27;t really care about getting bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this on my back because it&#x27;s tougher skin and a 2.5% concentration didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li>and then they are gone completely.</li>
            <li>He was losing hope and his confidence took a hit with his adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has completely healed my acne for a year now.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin peal, but I have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and WOW</li>
            <li>I have continued to be break out free and managed to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Seems like if you want this real product, you only get it once.</li>
            <li>no matter how good the product, it&#x27;s completely useless if i can&#x27;t coax it from the bottle.</li>
            <li>acne has plagued me for years and for the first time in a long time, i can go out without wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li>one thing I do not like is that the pump doesn&#x27;t seem to work once the bottle is half full.</li>
            <li>but when they finally raised the prices too high I started to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face both morning and night, but because it bleaches many colored fabrics, I&#x27;m careful what I wear after I apply it (and only sleep on white pillow cases) and don&#x27;t use it during the day on my back.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a decrease in new blemishes in the acne prone area of my body including my shoulders and upper thigh.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this bottle, considering that I never heard of this brand and the affordable price, I was not highly optimistic that It was going to be effective, OH BOY WAS I WRONG?</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily now for about a week and all my acne that was absolutly all over my body is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>So I decided to upgrade to 10% and my face has been almost completely clear, because of the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>,  Proactiv was completely ineffective and I was left with zits everywhere, so</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old who has moderate acne on her face.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>it tends to just sit on the surface of the skin as a white film even when you really work it in until dry.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived a little earlier than expected and is such a great value because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I usually use it at night, wash it all off when I wake up and moisturize my skin really well to avoid any dryness after using high % of Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter has severe acne on her face and her upper back.</li>
            <li>the pump works really well and its the same quality as the other stuff I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Actually burnt her face, but that may have been due to frustration and applying too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any other brands, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that really works then this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li>and I recommend you to use this sparingly with a q-tip applied directly on stubborn breakouts and let it dry.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few weeks now and works just as well as the small overpriced 1 oz tubes from the store but at a much better price.</li>
            <li>I would only advice to be careful with how much you use this as it causes dryness but just rub some chapstick on the dry areas in the morning</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I expected to receive and it works as well as the other benzoyl peroxide creams I&#x27;ve gotten by prescription.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and goes on very light.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It really is a good value.</li>
            <li> get yourself a good non-comedogenic moisturizer, and this product, and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> Good customer support from Dr. Song.</li>
            <li> It can be drying until your skin adjusts so just use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> This stuff works every bit as good as the prescription stuff.  </li>
            <li> I put on the BP before bed after a good rinse of Witch</li>
            <li> It is very smooth with no grain like some do and absorbs great .</li>
            <li> It can be drying as it is very potent.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know whether the 10% would be too strong for me, but it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> That cream worked good however it was very strong or has a ingredient that started to irritate my skin over time.  </li>
            <li> I think the products made by DR Song are top quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
            <li> The gel is a perfect 10% benzoyl peroxyde and does exactly what it is supposed to: clears acne in days.</li>
            <li> I have gone through my first bottle of this and it has been the best benzoyl peroxide product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works way better than proactiv!</li>
            <li> You get a lot more product for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> make sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for a acne..</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts me a good 3 months before I run out, saved a lot of money and MORE EFFECTIVE RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> I used Oxy Facewash with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know, but</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a $10 amazon gift card though.</li>
            <li> Having the pump bottle is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Every bottle that I&#x27;ve used has this problem, so you kind of have to shake it out to use it.</li>
            <li> I also really liked that it came with a 10 dollar gift card promotion.</li>
            <li> consistency of the product is nice.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice container</li>
            <li> This makes a perfect spot treatment, but it is too drying to use over your whole face.</li>
            <li> A+, great cream at a very nice price, works very well.    </li>
            <li> Great price and great results so far.</li>
            <li> Large bottle for a very good price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Acne Cream I have used</li>
            <li> Our son says this is the best product he&#x27;s used so far.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it is effective.</li>
            <li> By far the best thing we&#x27;ve found for my daughters skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff!</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good packaging.</li>
            <li> Good product though, works quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is a much better price</li>
            <li> In fact I think my makeup looks better after using it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs on the skin much better</li>
            <li> I would also like to say that since using this product I can do more things to my skin and it does not break out .</li>
            <li> but most docters dont prescribe 10%.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> so i treat my skin with 10% Benzoyl peroxide cream and soap and my skin is ok now.</li>
            <li> Questions are welcomed :)</li>
            <li> better products out there</li>
            <li> better works with taking \\&quot;clearzine\\&quot; 6-8 pills</li>
            <li> The pump eliminates the many problems and looks better on your counter.  </li>
            <li> Too many words required.</li>
            <li> been using the 10% BP cream for a couple of months and the difference is night and day compared to the selection at most stores.  </li>
            <li> Although, I should have researched more about benzoyl peroxide, because it WILL stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it all over my face at night and as a spot treatment during the day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m also glad i ordered the smaller size, since it&#x27;s perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> More Dr. Song products, and this one lives up just as well as all of the others.  </li>
            <li> glad I went for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best 10% gel I&#x27;ve used, it zaps up my pimples overnight and has saved my face on multiple occassions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try  Dr. Song&#x27;s acne cream, and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> its getting better...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product</li>
            <li> I will buy again and again :) i am happy i have a very clear face now :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has acne and it doesn&#x27;t work every time for him, but I just have normal skin with intermittent breakouts and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle was thicker and had a good pump.</li>
            <li> towels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had marginal success with the cream from Proactive but the Dr. Song product is leaps and bounds more effective.</li>
            <li> individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with the result so far!</li>
            <li> It turned out to be the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on an acne product.</li>
            <li> Goes on and soaks in very quickly</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 10% gel is strong and soaks in immediately.</li>
            <li> Also its the best price for such a large amount and you cant beat that!</li>
            <li> It is the best BP on the market hands down .</li>
            <li> It turned my mild acne into a cystic nightmare !</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the product for just over two weeks now and the results are much better than I expected and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> my skin has cleared, a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song is smooth and inoffensive with no odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since day one of using the cream (twice a day - morning and evening), he is blemish free.</li>
            <li> I apply cream morning and night and have been 90% breakout free.</li>
            <li> Easy to dispense and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for me until the 2nd week!  </li>
            <li> Song&#x27;s BP is light weight cream that sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li> By the 3rd day, there was a noticable difference in that her acne was no longer inflamed/swollen and the redness was greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Was able to notice an improvement after the first day of use</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how many people stop and tell me how clear my skin is!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite gel so far :)</li>
            <li> I have been ordering Dr. Songs benzoyl peroxide for a while now as it is as good as or better than any other type of BP I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get a refund because Amazon doesn&#x27;t do special handling.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of this was great, and the company essentially harassed me for a review of their product.</li>
            <li> I use a salicylic acid moisturizer which keeps my skin pretty smooth and blackhead free.</li>
            <li> I just love this product even though it&#x27;s very drying for my skin, it works, cleared up my skin in days.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the fabulous reviews I thought it was worth a shot to replace my proactiv.</li>
            <li> Love the pump too - much easier to handle while applying.</li>
            <li> Great Price, but no positive results.</li>
            <li> and I will be a loyal customer from now on.</li>
            <li> Works quickly without over-drying skin.</li>
            <li> it works so much better for me than most big name brand BP treatments.  </li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and have been using it 2 times a day for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> It drys up quick</li>
            <li> a mild cleanser, this cream has already cleared the skin significantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleared me up quick.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive and neutrogena products before and noticed they weren&#x27;t very effective and pricey, Dr. Song however was very affordable and has actually made a noticeable difference with my acne.</li>
            <li> and it was working more like 70% when it was in its GOOD OLD DAYS, as of Mid 2014</li>
            <li> I fortunately still had the first bottle</li>
            <li> Very affordable compared to Proactiv, goes on light, absorbs quickly, and keeps my acne in check.</li>
            <li> so make sure you let it dry before touching skin to pigmented fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on you tube a few months ago where I heard a great review of acne.org .</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper, but still effective substitute and this is definitely the one.</li>
            <li> if its worth the money to you.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> Love that it is clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or sheets.</li>
            <li> Overall great product so far.</li>
            <li> Im buying another bottle right now.</li>
            <li> product itself is overall pretty effective in keeping acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dried my face out at first, but my skin adapted in a week and it&#x27;s super nice now!</li>
            <li> It peels off your skin right from the first day..</li>
            <li> but this is true of pretty much any acne product that works.</li>
            <li> It has been great about reducing red scars on my skin as well as drying up pimples that are already present.</li>
            <li> i still like this product very much, but the pump is prone to clogging.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this product with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and minimal other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m pregnant and it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> Overall I gave this a five star because imo the exceptional results have far outweighed the negatives.</li>
            <li> had higher hopes for this product....</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot, I am still with my first 8 oz bottle but have been using it since almost october.</li>
            <li> Work very well !</li>
            <li> I actually like it much better than the Oxy product.</li>
            <li> my back is 80% better.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever felt compelled to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t give it a second look when on your shelf.</li>
            <li> bought this for one of my kids who is a chef and always in a greasy, hot cooking environment.</li>
            <li> Big fan and love the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for an over the counter acne solution.</li>
            <li> a much more efficient packaging solution would be to use a larger version of the 2oz bottle; no pump to clog up.    </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li> This is very drying, as is all benzoyl peroxide (but it has not irritated my skin).&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> so I took out the better pump from the first bottle and used it to replace the cheaper non working pump in the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would buy again if they make it thicker and hopefully put in the better pump that actually works.</li>
            <li> Great for spot treatment and the 8 oz will also last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try to find an alternate container, but i&#x27;d be wasting most of the cream trying to get it out of the old, original bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Witch hazel to pretty much stop any acne from occurring.</li>
            <li> Most people here are complaining that it makes there skin dry and inflamed</li>
            <li> It is still strong enough to bleach pillows/towels</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that there were times that I just slathered this on large areas of my skin as well.</li>
            <li> Like the large size and pump.</li>
            <li> Comes in a large container for the price.</li>
            <li> the new one still clogged, but i was able to open it up with a pin - but it continued to be a problem.</li>
            <li> dr. song sent a new one out to me right away.</li>
            <li> I use it for my back acne and face, and having the option to buy a large size is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I was so excited, used it, clear acne, but left my skin super flaky.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use Dr. Song because it has few ingredients and the price for the size is an amazing deal.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with making a return</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how much of a miracle this cream is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helped improve my body acne.</li>
            <li> Dries up the blemish really fast.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> This is really drying for my skin (which is sort of the point)</li>
            <li> cream really works.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than they said it would, securely packaged as well.</li>
            <li> It did not work as well, and it was not nearly as thick as the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> have always had very oily skin and acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> It was to much.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really cleared up his cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I always use it when I get an attack of red pimples and/or whiteheads and get clear skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face for the first few days, but honestly that’s usually a good sign for me since my face adjusts to any cream quickly and usually becomes oily again.</li>
            <li> I tried dozens and dozens of OTC and prescription products and this is the first thing that has completely gotten rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li> It immediately changes my skin from a bit rough to very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was then left with my mild acne and the scars caused by the cystic acne .</li>
            <li> Works well for my daughter&#x27;s combination skin with mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> Much better than paying ten bucks for a teeny tiny bottle of Oxy like when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite suprised, as it works better than the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> My teen had started getting mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it at night followed by a decent moisturizer then in the morning an aha lotion and moisturizer to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you used benzoyl peroxide for acne, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We still get a few pimples now and then, but they are much smaller and they disappear a lot more quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many soaps, cleansing pads and scrubs and got little or no results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week now, and my acne cleared up significantly, and no new pimples are appearing.</li>
            <li> Strong BP % which is great for the thicker skin of the body [not the face] but the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is actually a cream and unless you mix it with other fatty acids like your moisturizer or essential oils</li>
            <li> but that is normal with acne products</li>
            <li> i have seen remarkable improvement in my complexion: cystic acne is under control, spots are fading and my face is as soft as a babies behind.</li>
            <li> but because the second bottle I ordered was more watery, I had to take out the hair dryer and dry it before putting on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other benzoyl peroxides in the past but did not have a good reaction, so I was hesitant at first, but</li>
            <li> One dab for the left, one for the right and one for the forehead.</li>
            <li> If used daily it will clear up skin in a couple of days, but I have pretty sensitive skin, so it dries out my skin pretty severely if I don&#x27;t slather moisturizer on it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller who shared their lab test showing 10% and said they were using a new manufacturing company and working out kinks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, as it was a life saver since I had the painful kind.  </li>
            <li> Very strong will buy less % next time.  </li>
            <li> It helps with decreasing the amount of pimples you get (I get little bumps and whiteheads, not so much cysts/blackheads) , and those that have come up I have been able to extract and use this on-- it dries them right up and cuts down on redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does gradually work, so don&#x27;t expect miracles on the first application, but the second I added it</li>
            <li> am 30 year old guy, I tried everything in the world!</li>
            <li> I find my pimples do become a bit more &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; but they are usually one or two in a week</li>
            <li> first, I was a bit dubiout, since it seems that some of the reviews were/are possibly fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> clogged the first time just a short time after purchase and</li>
            <li> My first order lasted several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only  had it for about two days now, but it is pretty watery.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is perfect for application on such a large part of the body, but I also use small amounts on a few pimples on my face (which dry out over night with this).</li>
            <li> The down side is that it really dries your skin out when using every day (can be kinda flakey, but imo the results are worth it) but</li>
            <li> As the other guy mentioned, you should not apply it more than once per day if you don&#x27;t want you skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> It helped me clear majority of my acne over months.</li>
            <li> I stopped using and it took about 2 months to clear up .</li>
            <li> Lets say it did clear 90% of my acne, and I use it also on my shoulders since I tend to have oily skin</li>
            <li> I am on my way to almost looking completely clear.</li>
            <li> This product worked well along with a benzoyl peroxide soap to clear up my keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li> my skin was this clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 Years old and have been struggling since I was 13 with acne .</li>
            <li> So if you use this on your body, wear completely white or wear something you don&#x27;t really care about getting bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this on my back because it&#x27;s tougher skin and a 2.5% concentration didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li> and then they are gone completely.</li>
            <li> He was losing hope and his confidence took a hit with his adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has completely healed my acne for a year now.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin peal, but I have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and WOW</li>
            <li> I have continued to be break out free and managed to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seems like if you want this real product, you only get it once.</li>
            <li> no matter how good the product, it&#x27;s completely useless if i can&#x27;t coax it from the bottle.</li>
            <li> acne has plagued me for years and for the first time in a long time, i can go out without wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li> one thing I do not like is that the pump doesn&#x27;t seem to work once the bottle is half full.</li>
            <li> but when they finally raised the prices too high I started to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face both morning and night, but because it bleaches many colored fabrics, I&#x27;m careful what I wear after I apply it (and only sleep on white pillow cases) and don&#x27;t use it during the day on my back.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in new blemishes in the acne prone area of my body including my shoulders and upper thigh.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this bottle, considering that I never heard of this brand and the affordable price, I was not highly optimistic that It was going to be effective, OH BOY WAS I WRONG?</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily now for about a week and all my acne that was absolutly all over my body is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> So I decided to upgrade to 10% and my face has been almost completely clear, because of the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> ,  Proactiv was completely ineffective and I was left with zits everywhere, so</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old who has moderate acne on her face.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> it tends to just sit on the surface of the skin as a white film even when you really work it in until dry.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived a little earlier than expected and is such a great value because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it at night, wash it all off when I wake up and moisturize my skin really well to avoid any dryness after using high % of Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter has severe acne on her face and her upper back.</li>
            <li> the pump works really well and its the same quality as the other stuff I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Actually burnt her face, but that may have been due to frustration and applying too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any other brands, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that really works then this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> and I recommend you to use this sparingly with a q-tip applied directly on stubborn breakouts and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and works just as well as the small overpriced 1 oz tubes from the store but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> I would only advice to be careful with how much you use this as it causes dryness but just rub some chapstick on the dry areas in the morning</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected to receive and it works as well as the other benzoyl peroxide creams I&#x27;ve gotten by prescription.</li>
            <li> I am always hopeful  whenI use a new product but every time I am let down ....</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical due to the low price, but I figured the most I have to lose is a few bucks if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was normally using a prescription acne medication, but realistically speaking, who&#x27;s gonna wanna stay on prescription, especially when it costs a few bucks to get your medication.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only side effect is it may sting or dry your skin</li>
            <li> Obviously your skin will dry out, so I am applying this once a day, not 3 times a day as per instructions, but I guess this is something</li>
            <li> i am 50 years old but look no older than 30 since i have extremely oily skin and no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The second bottle I order several months later was a little too watery.  </li>
            <li> It got my face 90% clear within a few days.</li>
            <li> only thing you need  to be careful when you&#x27;re using any Benzoyl Peroxide product is,</li>
            <li> It may be harsh for sensitive skin/face.</li>
            <li> so you dont have to wait too long to put on layer of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was getting minor acne when I was using Dr. Dans and Acnefree.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return the item, I also wish I had the same results as other buyers.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase this product from Dr. Song and am inspired to try some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> Over the counter 2.5%/5% creams were less than effective, and quite expensive for  such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> and AGAIN I would rather have dry skin than pimply skin any day.  </li>
            <li> Over time Benzoyl peroxide will dry out the plastic tubes and then break when you try to use them.  </li>
            <li> I can apply and by the time I make it to the bed, it&#x27;s already dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> So give 2.5 % a try  if you have dry skin..</li>
            <li> i rub it in after washing and my face is dry, allow it to absorb for 10-15 minutes and apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so your skin doesnt dry</li>
            <li> skin becomes dry and i had burning sensation.</li>
            <li> this actually helped me to get rid of a few of the blackheads I had buried kinda deep on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No new acne but getting rash on my neck.</li>
            <li> Noticed the acne around my jaw disappearing, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li> The product is creamy with tiny little particules in it.</li>
            <li> When I started applying without apply lotion afterward it really dry my face but after reading some other comment about using location helps a lot.</li>
            <li> but I kinda like having partially orange eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so you do have to be careful not to get it on clothing, I knew this before hand</li>
            <li> so I have been really careful</li>
            <li> If put on heavy it does leave a bit of white residue.</li>
            <li> I was using over the counter salycilic acid products, with not much result.</li>
            <li> But personally it&#x27;s not a problem for me since I use it on my thick back skin and follow with a salicylic acid moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I guess this product works because it got rid of my pimples on my face &amp; scalp, but its VeRy dry!  </li>
            <li> I have spent LOTS of money on Proactiv and other well known name brand products and none have worked as well as Benzoyl Peroxide Cream (which was recommended by our pediatrician).  </li>
            <li> Complained to the company about my skin been so dry, they actually sent a 2.5% to try which I prefer..</li>
            <li> I used to buy Benzoyl in small quantities at almost the same price as this.</li>
            <li> I feel like some other BP feels itchy when you apply and they do start to sting sometimes</li>
            <li> They have discontinued that product and substituted one with fragrance and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> The product container itself arrived covered in dust and the label had worn off due to years of storage.</li>
            <li> As long a i continue to use it everyday</li>
            <li> BP never touched my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;Never had this rash with other BP creams.</li>
            <li> plan to repurchase this, and may consider using some of Dr. Song&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Although it leaves your skin a bit dry, but nothing a little moisturizer could not fix.</li>
            <li> and I use less due to the stronger content.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great cream for half of what other is asking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump also doesn&#x27;t really work, weirdly.</li>
            <li> My acne issue wasnt average, it was severe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they put a lot of other filler products in it !</li>
            <li> No more sitting in front of a fan waiting for goop to dry before I can go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Product works - slightly runny, do not need</li>
            <li> much (half pump, maybe even less can do your face and neck).</li>
            <li> When a breakout does occur, it is less severe and goes away</li>
            <li> The texture has a  slightly grainy feeling but seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> will not settle for anything less.</li>
            <li> Not goopy greasy mess.</li>
            <li> buy the 10% Dr Song BP and add a little water to it .</li>
            <li> The Dan kern used to burn my eyes a little</li>
            <li> The product dries out my skin a little, but nothing a little oil-free moisturizer can&#x27;t help with.</li>
            <li> I tried some OTC BP products which seemed to work a little bit, then I stumbled upon Dr Song which said they don&#x27;t contain unnecessary harmful chemicals that big brands have in them.</li>
            <li> I can notice my skin clearing and the acne stopping dead in its tracks.</li>
            <li> I use at night as a treatment then moisturize after it has dried.</li>
            <li> It dried my skinned and my eyelids...</li>
            <li> Was cheaper than acne.org which ive been using for years but is also grittier and leaves white ashy film behind.</li>
            <li> Burned and dried out my face.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday</li>
            <li> Another thing I would like to add is there is no strong smell and the product does not feel heavy or itchy .</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it everyday, since it dries my face, so as a result I get a small pimple here and there, but</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of skin care products in the past .</li>
            <li> I use quite a few of their products !</li>
            <li> You may apply a small amount on the area.</li>
            <li> there are no more zits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryness is self-explanatory at 10% benzol peroxide, and the dyeing effect is something I found out the hard</li>
            <li> I put it thickly on my face when I shower and leave it on until it starts to sting - a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i have to bump my 5 star rating down to a 3.</li>
            <li> Now I have a solution to such a bad problem and I will be continuing to order this product because its a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I use a thin layer all over except on delicate eye tissue.</li>
            <li> but it is thin and runny compared to some others we have used.</li>
            <li> One of the pumps on 8 ounce bottle was broken and would not for the life of it release or pump.</li>
            <li> and it got way to expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> yes, that disgusting acne on the back.  </li>
            <li> Not even expensive, multi-step prescription products from the dermatologist could do this.  </li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne which is difficult to get rid.  </li>
            <li> I had a such a terrible experience with this product.</li>
            <li> the pump has completely failed.</li>
            <li> but it got too expensive</li>
            <li> I have terrible acne all over my back and shoulders do to some hormone issues.</li>
            <li> I would still get random acne breakouts after using this.</li>
            <li> But I was desperate so</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong !</li>
            <li> Well I ordered it and it was the worst decision ever !</li>

            <li> Great product. When I started applying without apply lotion afterward it really dry my face but after reading some other comment about using location helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I just love this product even though it&#x27;s very drying for my skin, it works, cleared up my skin in days. This is my go to product to control my hormonal breakouts</li>
            <li> Been using Dr. Song for about a year now and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Very affordable compared to Proactiv, goes on light, absorbs quickly, and keeps my acne in check.</li>
            <li> Been using another brand that is similar but the price kept going up. And it felt like my skin was used to the 2% solution. This is a much better price and I like the 10% solution. Goes on and soaks in very quickly and I use less due to the stronger content. Very happy with the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Fights my occasional breakout without drying out my skn!!! This is by far the best Acne Cream I have used and I have used several!</li>
            <li> had higher hopes for this product....didn&#x27;t work very well AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with making a return is by the time the item arrives, and you give it a chance to see results,&lt;br /&gt;the window time of return passes. BOO.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a reduction in acne and any existing acne I experienced went away within a day or so.</li>
            <li> It helped me clear majority of my acne over months. You just have to be regular and religious when using this product. I tried some OTC BP products which seemed to work a little bit, then I stumbled upon Dr Song which said they don&#x27;t contain unnecessary harmful chemicals that big brands have in them. I gave it a shot, I am still with my first 8 oz bottle but have been using it since almost october. 3 dabs everynight before going to bed after a facewash all over my face (since I almost had acne in every part of my face). One dab for the left, one for the right and one for the forehead. Give it some time to work and you might see the results you&#x27;ve been wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking off one star because the BP damaged some of my clothes and towels in the laundry since it&#x27;s a bleaching agent, not necessarily Dr song&#x27;s fault but mine for not reading the label carefuly. Also the product seems to work, it needs a lot of patience, I still have some acne left on my cheeks. Oh and yes, the shipping is a bit hight for the size of the product. But I was desperate so what the heck! :D</li>
            <li> I used to buy Benzoyl in small quantities at almost the same price as this. It really is a good value. One gripe is that I wish they did Amazon Prime. I emailed them about it and they said they&#x27;d look into it. the pump works really well and its the same quality as the other stuff I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I guess this product works because it got rid of my pimples on my face &amp; scalp, but its VeRy dry!  I was so excited, used it, clear acne, but left my skin super flaky.  But comparing this Dr Song  vs Proactiv, Dr Song is safer because it doesn&#x27;t have Paraben</li>
            <li> I never write reviews !!!  I have used a lot of skin care products in the past . At one point I felt like I have tried everything ! I have even used accutane !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 Years old and have been struggling since I was 13 with acne . I am always hopeful  whenI use a new product but every time I am let down ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on you tube a few months ago where I heard a great review of acne.org . I was so excited to try it . Well I ordered it and it was the worst decision ever ! It turned my mild acne into a cystic nightmare ! I know it was the acne.org because I was only using that system at the time ! I continued to use it because I though it was just purging my skin ! Boy was I wrong ! I was so depressed ! I stopped using and it took about 2 months to clear up . I was then left with my mild acne and the scars caused by the cystic acne . My skin is destroyed with holes !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway .... I am writing to say that the only thing that has helped my acne in all of these years in the 10% Dr Song BP . It is the best BP on the market hands down . I don&#x27;t think they put a lot of other filler products in it ! It is very smooth with no grain like some do and absorbs great . You can def use it under makeup ! In fact I think my makeup looks better after using it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone ! I think the products made by DR Song are top quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price ! I use quite a few of their products ! I think they make the products very simple and without fillers !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the 10% Dr Song BP and add a little water to it . It absorbs on the skin much better and it does not irritate my skin at all . Another thing I would like to add is there is no strong smell and the product does not feel heavy or itchy . I feel like some other BP feels itchy when you apply and they do start to sting sometimes ( They just feel ewwww gross )  . I would also like to say that since using this product I can do more things to my skin and it does not break out . It used to break out over everything !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful ! I love this product and will use it always !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you DR Song !</li>
            <li> Most people here are complaining that it makes there skin dry and inflamed but most docters dont prescribe 10%. If your getting these side effects you should use 2% or 5%. I myself have been using benzoyl peroxide 5% for about a year. It helped but wasnt enough. So I decided to upgrade to 10% and my face has been almost completely clear, because of the occasional pimple. I also noticed that if you put some on a pimple, it would be gone in a day or two.</li>
            <li> May work Okay but it is thin and runny compared to some others we have used.</li>
            <li> Son loves it and like others say the value is superb.  Wish I&#x27;d known about this ages ago</li>
            <li> Big size bottle. You may apply a small amount on the area. Work very well !&lt;br /&gt;I use to take accutane and my acne still there so i treat my skin with 10% Benzoyl peroxide cream and soap and my skin is ok now.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered and used was the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Cream 8oz Dr Song lotion. I’ve been using the product for just over two weeks now and the results are much better than I expected and am quite happy with the results. I have been using prescription Benzaclin which costs about $300 with my insurance plan and it got way to expensive to maintain. I was looking for a cheaper, but still effective substitute and this is definitely the one. Great price and great results so far. It dried out my face for the first few days, but honestly that’s usually a good sign for me since my face adjusts to any cream quickly and usually becomes oily again. This product has proven to keep the oiliness away and continues to keep my acne away. Can&#x27;t beat this product for the price!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this bottle, considering that I never heard of this brand and the affordable price, I was not highly optimistic that It was going to be effective, OH BOY WAS I WRONG? Lets say it did clear 90% of my acne, and I use it also on my shoulders since I tend to have oily skin and I tend to break out their every now and then and it works perfectly, I aimed for 10% since I do have noticeable breakouts and I need them wiped out so I opted for the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.  Only side effect is it may sting or dry your skin but that is normal with acne products and AGAIN I would rather have dry skin than pimply skin any day.  This product does gradually work, so don&#x27;t expect miracles on the first application, but the second I added it I can notice my skin clearing and the acne stopping dead in its tracks. I used  to use proactiv and it was working more like 70% when it was in its GOOD OLD DAYS, as of Mid 2014,  Proactiv was completely ineffective and I was left with zits everywhere, so Dr.Song was a life saver.  I have been using since October 2014 and I will be a loyal customer from now on. LETS JUST HOPE, that you guys do not reduce or change your formula.  I am amazed, and all I need is one dab application once a day before bed and I am all set.  Bottle lasts me a good 3 months before I run out, saved a lot of money and MORE EFFECTIVE RESULTS.  I can not tell you how many people stop and tell me how clear my skin is!!!!</li>
            <li> I used Oxy Facewash with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide for many years and loved it. They have discontinued that product and substituted one with fragrance and other chemicals. I was very happy to find this product with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and minimal other ingredients. I actually like it much better than the Oxy product. I don&#x27;t have acne, but use this as an exfoliate. I put it thickly on my face when I shower and leave it on until it starts to sting - a couple of minutes. It immediately changes my skin from a bit rough to very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st product I&#x27;ve tried from Dr Song&#x27;s line and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far. The product is creamy with tiny little particules in it. It&#x27;s very effective and I recommend you to use this sparingly with a q-tip applied directly on stubborn breakouts and let it dry. But keep in mind that there were times that I just slathered this on large areas of my skin as well. I usually use it at night, wash it all off when I wake up and moisturize my skin really well to avoid any dryness after using high % of Benzoyl Peroxide. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you need  to be careful when you&#x27;re using any Benzoyl Peroxide product is, know that it does bleach the clothing. So if you use this on your body, wear completely white or wear something you don&#x27;t really care about getting bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have dry/combination skin. Questions are welcomed :)</li>
            <li> Strong BP % which is great for the thicker skin of the body [not the face] but the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is actually a cream and unless you mix it with other fatty acids like your moisturizer or essential oils it tends to just sit on the surface of the skin as a white film even when you really work it in until dry.  Also, the bottle came reading 10% on the front label but 2.5% on the ingredent composition label.  I contacted the seller who shared their lab test showing 10% and said they were using a new manufacturing company and working out kinks.  Great for the price but better products out there if its worth the money to you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well for my daughter&#x27;s combination skin with mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works quickly without over-drying skin.</li>
            <li> I tried 2 oz first,now I know I need this.&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 year old guy, I tried everything in the world! EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing helps me like this product. Just try it and you will see what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better works with taking \\&quot;clearzine\\&quot; 6-8 pills a day.&lt;br /&gt;So you will get outside and inside effects!!!</li>
            <li> I used the Dan Kern acne dot org benzoyle for years but when they finally raised the prices too high I started to look elsewhere. I prefer the Dr. Song lotion over the Dan Kern and the Proactive. The Dan kern used to burn my eyes a little and I do t like the smell of the Proactive. Dr. Song is smooth and inoffensive with no odor. The 2.5 works just as well as the 10% without the over drying.</li>
            <li> I use this on my back because it&#x27;s tougher skin and a 2.5% concentration didn&#x27;t do much for it. I tried the acne.org but that&#x27;s only 2.5% so I wanted something stronger. Within a week of using this 10% my back is 80% better. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Product works - slightly runny, do not need much (half pump, maybe even less can do your face and neck). I use it once a day/once every two days because it can be quite drying. I find my pimples do become a bit more &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; but they are usually one or two in a week and then they are gone completely. (Only when I forget to use the cream do my pimples return). The product container itself arrived covered in dust and the label had worn off due to years of storage.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how much of a miracle this cream is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have greasy skin and severe cystic acne, then try this.  My husband visited dermatologists for the last 14-years and tried everything under the sun.  He was losing hope and his confidence took a hit with his adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since day one of using the cream (twice a day - morning and evening), he is blemish free.</li>
            <li> Great Price, but no positive results. Actually burnt her face, but that may have been due to frustration and applying too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!  I buy products on Amazon almost daily and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever felt compelled to write a review.  For 20+ years I have suffered bacne...yes, that disgusting acne on the back.  I tried dozens and dozens of OTC and prescription products and this is the first thing that has completely gotten rid of my acne.  Not even expensive, multi-step prescription products from the dermatologist could do this.  It&#x27;s truly a miracle!  I wash my face, chest, shoulders, and back every morning and night and then apply Dr. Song&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide.  I use it on my face both morning and night, but because it bleaches many colored fabrics, I&#x27;m careful what I wear after I apply it (and only sleep on white pillow cases) and don&#x27;t use it during the day on my back.  During the day I put salicylic acid on my back because it won&#x27;t bleach my clothes.  This has completely healed my acne for a year now.  I&#x27;m so thankful!!  I have recommended it to several people and they have all had similar results.  My mom said it help get rid of age/sun spots on her face.</li>
            <li> Like the large size and pump.</li>
            <li> This really helped improve my body acne. I am on my way to almost looking completely clear. Im buying another bottle right now.</li>
            <li> 10% Benzoyl Peroxide wash was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve found that this cream (which is apply and leave on) works well in conjunction with a daily Benzoyl wash for neck and back. It may be harsh for sensitive skin/face. I apply cream morning and night and have been 90% breakout free. When a breakout does occur, it is less severe and goes away shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that with ANY Benzoyl Peroxide products, clothing may get bleached (including collars and colored towels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had marginal success with the cream from Proactive but the Dr. Song product is leaps and bounds more effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to dispense and to keep clean.  Over time Benzoyl peroxide will dry out the plastic tubes and then break when you try to use them.  The pump eliminates the many problems and looks better on your counter.  Most people don&#x27;t give it a second look when on your shelf.</li>
            <li> worth Ame aon is gonna lose my businesss. Would  purchase again.  Very strong will buy less % next time.  Too many words required. Ama</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have found this, it has and continues to be one of the best treatments I have used in 10 years of having acne. I have used proactive and neutrogena products before and noticed they weren&#x27;t very effective and pricey, Dr. Song however was very affordable and has actually made a noticeable difference with my acne. I would only advice to be careful with how much you use this as it causes dryness but just rub some chapstick on the dry areas in the morning and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 Would recommend!</li>
            <li> bought this for one of my kids who is a chef and always in a greasy, hot cooking environment. He uses it every day and it keeps the zits away. Much better than paying ten bucks for a teeny tiny bottle of Oxy like when I was in my 20s. Hooray!</li>
            <li> I was normally using a prescription acne medication, but realistically speaking, who&#x27;s gonna wanna stay on prescription, especially when it costs a few bucks to get your medication.&lt;br /&gt;I looked through TONS of products before finding this one.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was a bit dubiout, since it seems that some of the reviews were/are possibly fake.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t say that they are or aren&#x27;t, &#x27;cuz I honestly don&#x27;t know, but what I CAN say is that I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually take advantage of the grainyness of the product and use it to exfoliate my face by rubbing it in circular motions all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;Doing this actually helped me to get rid of a few of the blackheads I had buried kinda deep on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;This dries my face and bleaches my clothes and eyebrows, but that&#x27;s kinda to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;The dryness is self-explanatory at 10% benzol peroxide, and the dyeing effect is something I found out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or what, but I kinda like having partially orange eyebrows. It&#x27;s kinda neat and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is overall pretty effective in keeping acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it everyday, since it dries my face, so as a result I get a small pimple here and there, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;Just get yourself a good non-comedogenic moisturizer, and this product, and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far.  The texture has a  slightly grainy feeling but seems to be working.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected to receive and it works as well as the other benzoyl peroxide creams I&#x27;ve gotten by prescription. Quick delivery, good packaging.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has acne and it doesn&#x27;t work every time for him, but I just have normal skin with intermittent breakouts and it works great for me.  Dries up the blemish really fast.</li>
            <li> The gel is a perfect 10% benzoyl peroxyde and does exactly what it is supposed to: clears acne in days. I always use it when I get an attack of red pimples and/or whiteheads and get clear skin very quickly. The product does cause some redness and peeling but this is true of pretty much any acne product that works. Peels are necessary for acne anyway. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> been using the 10% BP cream for a couple of months and the difference is night and day compared to the selection at most stores.  it works so much better for me than most big name brand BP treatments.  this is my go to blemish fighter now.  will not settle for anything less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, this works like a charm. As long a i continue to use it everyday there are no more zits.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in skin clarity within 2 days. I am a repeated purchaser now.</li>
            <li> Best deal for the quantity and price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works wonderfully and goes on very light. Not goopy greasy mess. I can apply and by the time I make it to the bed, it&#x27;s already dry to the touch. No more sitting in front of a fan waiting for goop to dry before I can go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for a acne.. Within days of using this gel my pimples were gone. Although it leaves your skin a bit dry, but nothing a little moisturizer could not fix. Complained to the company about my skin been so dry, they actually sent a 2.5% to try which I prefer..How is that for customers service? So give 2.5 % a try  if you have dry skin..</li>
            <li> Worked great for me until the 2nd week!  Wasn&#x27;t effective at all</li>
            <li> I was using acne cream by Topix.  That cream worked good however it was very strong or has a ingredient that started to irritate my skin over time.  I decided to use Dr. Song because it has few ingredients and the price for the size is an amazing deal.  I have hormonal acne which is difficult to get rid.  I use this with my Topix acne wash and it does a great job at helping to control my acne.  Once I use up my current acne wash I will be purchasing the one made by Dr. Song.</li>
            <li> Our son says this is the best product he&#x27;s used so far.</li>
            <li> A+, great cream at a very nice price, works very well.    Good customer support from Dr. Song.</li>
            <li> Not working for purchase reason, for skin allergy for my dog,&lt;br /&gt;this was suggested by my vet.</li>
            <li> Have used the 2.5 version for awhile and it worked great. Now I&#x27;m pregnant and it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough. 10% gel is strong and soaks in immediately. Love that it is clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or sheets. Big fan and love the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for an over the counter acne solution. Although, I should have researched more about benzoyl peroxide, because it WILL stain your clothes. Also, I probably should have chosen a lower %. It makes my skin peal, but I have particularly sensitive skin. It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a $10 amazon gift card though.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it all over my face at night and as a spot treatment during the day. It dries up my pimples within two days when used as a spot treatment I will order again using the gift card</li>
            <li> I had a such a terrible experience with this product. After reading all the fabulous reviews I thought it was worth a shot to replace my proactiv. It seems like I&#x27;m applying water to my skin and that&#x27;s about it. It did NOTHING to help my acne. I wish I could return the item, I also wish I had the same results as other buyers.</li>
            <li> so i received the dr. song product yesterday, applied last night and now today in the morning i can definitely see a difference. i was a proactive user. it&#x27;s been one day so i will update in about a week, also the product was delivered fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well it&#x27;s been about a week and WOW my skin has cleared, a huge difference. My bottle was 10% and it is a cream not a gel. I use at night as a treatment then moisturize after it has dried. I have very oily skin it worked great for me. It can be drying until your skin adjusts so just use a good moisturizer.  My opinion hasn&#x27;t changed  it&#x27;s a great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well, priced well. Good product. Good service. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Noticed the acne around my jaw disappearing, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li> As the other guy mentioned, you should not apply it more than once per day if you don&#x27;t want you skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> Works great and a great price!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great value! I have gone through my first bottle of this and it has been the best benzoyl peroxide product I have ever used. Having the pump bottle is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I came across this product after using ProActiv and wanting to find something that would work as well, but with a cheaper price tag. I have continued to be break out free and managed to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This is really drying for my skin (which is sort of the point) so I use a pump of this and mix it with a pump of jojoba oil.  It has done WONDERS for my skin!!!</li>
            <li> edited: i still like this product very much, but the pump is prone to clogging. clogged the first time just a short time after purchase and dr. song sent a new one out to me right away. the new one still clogged, but i was able to open it up with a pin - but it continued to be a problem. now, with 1/3 of the product left in the bottle the pump has completely failed. i thought i would try to find an alternate container, but i&#x27;d be wasting most of the cream trying to get it out of the old, original bottle. unfortunately i have to bump my 5 star rating down to a 3. no matter how good the product, it&#x27;s completely useless if i can&#x27;t coax it from the bottle. a much more efficient packaging solution would be to use a larger version of the 2oz bottle; no pump to clog up.    i ordered the 2oz size to try it out and i&#x27;m back for more. i didn&#x27;t know whether the 10% would be too strong for me, but it works beautifully. i rub it in after washing and my face is dry, allow it to absorb for 10-15 minutes and apply moisturizer. i have seen remarkable improvement in my complexion: cystic acne is under control, spots are fading and my face is as soft as a babies behind. i am 50 years old but look no older than 30 since i have extremely oily skin and no wrinkles. acne has plagued me for years and for the first time in a long time, i can go out without wearing any makeup! i&#x27;m also glad i ordered the smaller size, since it&#x27;s perfect for travel. i will never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> A great acne treatment !!! Was able to notice an improvement after the first day of use</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and have been using it 2 times a day for 2 weeks now. I have noticed a decrease in new blemishes in the acne prone area of my body including my shoulders and upper thigh. I have tried almost everything and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the BenzaClin but it got too expensive so I bought this to try for my daughters Acme and it works just as great</li>
            <li> It does its job how ever I don&#x27;t like it in the pump. I now have to open it up to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Dans and also Acnefree terminator. Dr. Dans BP cream is only 2.5% BP and Acnefree terminator 10 is 10% BP.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Dan&#x27;s BP in the morning and used Acnefree terminator 10 only at night before sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song&#x27;s BP is light weight cream that sticks to your skin. It drys up quick so you dont have to wait too long to put on layer of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting minor acne when I was using Dr. Dans and Acnefree. After using Acnefree overnight, I can tell my acne has been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing same result from Dr. Song&#x27;s 10% BP cream.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Dan&#x27;s 2.5% BP is $20 + $6 ship and Acnefree 10% BP cream is $5 for just 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song&#x27;s 10% BP is $11 + $6 ship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cream for half of what other is asking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after using it for 2 months&lt;br /&gt;This cream really works. No new acne but getting rash on my neck. No I did not put it on my neck. BP never touched my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;Never had this rash with other BP creams. Guess something in this lotion I&#x27;m allegic to.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and excellent product. My first order lasted several months. I use daily in the evening before putting on facial oil or hylauronic cream and it keeps my acne at bay without overly drying. The pump bottle is perfect for this. I use a thin layer all over except on delicate eye tissue. You can also layer if you have a bigger pimple and it will reduce by morning. I like this because I don&#x27;t feel like I need to save the product, asI would if it was more expensive or in a smaller bottle (proactiv repairing lotion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is still strong enough to bleach pillows/towels so make sure you let it dry before touching skin to pigmented fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue ordering as needed!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the reviews and it just broke me out. It dried my skinned and my eyelids... My eye lids were swollen and such. I&#x27;m allergic to it I guess. I can&#x27;t even get a refund because Amazon doesn&#x27;t do special handling. I would NEVER buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and works just as well as the small overpriced 1 oz tubes from the store but at a much better price. Love the pump too - much easier to handle while applying.</li>
            <li> More Dr. Song products, and this one lives up just as well as all of the others.  I tried the brand out recently on a recommendation from a friend, and it has done wonders.  Now I use the stuff all the time because it is incredible.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any other brands, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that really works then this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than they said it would, securely packaged as well. If used daily it will clear up skin in a couple of days, but I have pretty sensitive skin, so it dries out my skin pretty severely if I don&#x27;t slather moisturizer on it twice a day. The pump also doesn&#x27;t really work, weirdly. Good product though, works quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s probably not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS!!!  I bought this for my 15 year old who has moderate acne on her face. She applied this after cleansing morning and night for 3 days then reduced application to once daily (at night).  By the 3rd day, there was a noticable difference in that her acne was no longer inflamed/swollen and the redness was greatly reduced.  It continues to look clearer every day.  It&#x27;s also making the skin appear smoother which is awesome.  The product arrived a little earlier than expected and is such a great value because a little goes a long way.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product from Dr. Song and am inspired to try some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> My acne has been on and off for years.  I have tried every prescription from the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the 10% gel this summer, and my acne is gone.  Everyone compliments how my acne and scars have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin with cystic acne, then I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good, acne problem solution.</li>
            <li> This product worked well along with a benzoyl peroxide soap to clear up my keratosis pilaris.  I use this product at night, and an AHA or Lactic Acid lotion in the morning.  It got my face 90% clear within a few days.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel so far :)</li>
            <li> The best thing for acne! Works way better than proactiv! You get a lot more product for a cheaper price! The only thing that has worked for me so far. I will buy again and again :) i am happy i have a very clear face now :)</li>
            <li> Great for body acne. Comes in a large container for the price.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and treats as well as the prescription clyndamicin medication I was on for years (Duac). It helps with decreasing the amount of pimples you get (I get little bumps and whiteheads, not so much cysts/blackheads) , and those that have come up I have been able to extract and use this on-- it dries them right up and cuts down on redness.&lt;br /&gt;Do make sure to moisturize! This is very drying, as is all benzoyl peroxide (but it has not irritated my skin).&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and was told to use a 10% cream from my doctor.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now and my cystic acne has gone away.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, as it was a life saver since I had the painful kind.  I&#x27;ve tried other benzoyl peroxides in the past but did not have a good reaction, so I was hesitant at first, but glad I went for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best benzoyl peroxide cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m quite suprised, as it works better than the more expensive brands.  I use it for my back acne and face, and having the option to buy a large size is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is the best 10% gel I&#x27;ve used, it zaps up my pimples overnight and has saved my face on multiple occassions. Great for spot treatment and the 8 oz will also last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works every bit as good as the prescription stuff.  I used it every day until my skin cleared up which was mabey two weeks then I went to using it once every 2 to 3 days, I don&#x27;t remember the last time my skin was this clear.  The down side is that it really dries your skin out when using every day (can be kinda flakey, but imo the results are worth it) but no issues while using once every couple of days.  It will bleach fabrics so you do have to be careful not to get it on clothing, I knew this before hand so I have been really careful but my bath towels have had this happen to them.  Overall I gave this a five star because imo the exceptional results have far outweighed the negatives.</li>
            <li> Was cheaper than acne.org which ive been using for years but is also grittier and leaves white ashy film behind. Was expecting 2.5 percent bp but received 10 percent. One of the pumps on 8 ounce bottle was broken and would not for the life of it release or pump.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of this was great, and the company essentially harassed me for a review of their product. My second bottle was very different, and seemed essentially like water was added to it. It did not work as well, and it was not nearly as thick as the first bottle. Oddly enough, I also was not bothered once to give a review (not because I already gave one... because I didn&#x27;t). Seems like if you want this real product, you only get it once. Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Large bottle for a very good price. This stuff worked wonders on my acne!</li>
            <li> Great seller. Great customer support. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> it dries your skin depending on the skin type you could try not washing your face or the area you are gonna apply it so your skin doesnt dry</li>
            <li> I have terrible acne all over my back and shoulders do to some hormone issues. I have tried many soaps, cleansing pads and scrubs and got little or no results. I tried this cream and I had results after one application! I have been using it daily now for about a week and all my acne that was absolutly all over my body is almost completely gone! I am amazed and shocked to have found a product that actually works so good. My acne issue wasnt average, it was severe. Now I have a solution to such a bad problem and I will be continuing to order this product because its a miracle worker. Also its the best price for such a large amount and you cant beat that!</li>
            <li> I have been ordering Dr. Songs benzoyl peroxide for a while now as it is as good as or better than any other type of BP I&#x27;ve ever used. At first I was skeptical due to the low price, but I figured the most I have to lose is a few bucks if it doesn&#x27;t work. It turned out to be the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on an acne product. You simply cannot beat the value of it for how well it works. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is working great at clearing up my son&#x27;s acne and helping with my spot problems.  We will definitely be using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Lots of BP for the Price! Cheapest BP that I could find anywhere. I have gone through about 10 of these is the last year or so and they do what I want them to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do no expect that using this alone will cure your acne, it should help a bit though. I use this in combination with Witch hazel to pretty much stop any acne from occurring. I put on the BP before bed after a good rinse of Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do not like is that the pump doesn&#x27;t seem to work once the bottle is half full. Every bottle that I&#x27;ve used has this problem, so you kind of have to shake it out to use it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice. The first bottle was thicker and had a good pump. The second bottle I order several months later was a little too watery.  And the second bottle, the pump did not work.  I fortunately still had the first bottle so I took out the better pump from the first bottle and used it to replace the cheaper non working pump in the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again if they make it thicker and hopefully put in the better pump that actually works. It does prevent acne so I use it all over my face, back and chest but because the second bottle I ordered was more watery, I had to take out the hair dryer and dry it before putting on pajamas.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very oily skin and acne so this 10% benzoyl peroxide is needed on my face once during the day and again at night to prevent acne. I use it on my back and chest at night but wear white pajamas and sleep in ivory sheets so not to worry about any bleach marks.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter has severe acne on her face and her upper back. I have spent LOTS of money on Proactiv and other well known name brand products and none have worked as well as Benzoyl Peroxide Cream (which was recommended by our pediatrician).  We will definitely be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only  had it for about two days now, but it is pretty watery. I find myself trying to rub it in for a while.</li>
            <li> works well, very good price and arrived in good condition. If you used benzoyl peroxide for acne, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best for body acne.. After several hundred dollars at determologist I found the answer!! Works great</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottle it comes in and it goes on smoothly. I also really liked that it came with a 10 dollar gift card promotion.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size/amount and strength (10%).  Most importantly, it is effective. My teen had started getting mild breakouts. Over the counter 2.5%/5% creams were less than effective, and quite expensive for  such a small amount of product. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try  Dr. Song&#x27;s acne cream, and I was pleased with the results. Combined w/ a mild cleanser, this cream has already cleared the skin significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the product is nice. It&#x27;s similar to a light moisturizer.  I did not find it to be drying, at all. The pump dispenser was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to repurchase this, and may consider using some of Dr. Song&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> It peels off your skin right from the first day.. skin becomes dry and i had burning sensation. but worked well on my face over 2 weeks.. its getting better...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It comes in a nice container AND it works. It has been great about reducing red scars on my skin as well as drying up pimples that are already present. It dried my face out at first, but my skin adapted in a week and it&#x27;s super nice now!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend and it has cleared up both of our skin!!! We still get a few pimples now and then, but they are much smaller and they disappear a lot more quickly. The company even reached out to me to see how the product was working. The product dries out my skin a little, but nothing a little oil-free moisturizer can&#x27;t help with. Otherwise, I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product and I won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> Very drying. Beware. Great product.</li>
            <li> Cleared me up quick. If put on heavy it does leave a bit of white residue. I recommend using it at night followed by a decent moisturizer then in the morning an aha lotion and moisturizer to help with the dryness. Overall great product so far.</li>
            <li> Burned and dried out my face. The burning was bearable but the dryness was not. It was to much.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my back and chest. I was using over the counter salycilic acid products, with not much result. I have used this product for a week now, and my acne cleared up significantly, and no new pimples are appearing. The size of the bottle is perfect for application on such a large part of the body, but I also use small amounts on a few pimples on my face (which dry out over night with this). Obviously your skin will dry out, so I am applying this once a day, not 3 times a day as per instructions, but I guess this is something individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with the result so far!</li>
            <li> This makes a perfect spot treatment, but it is too drying to use over your whole face. As a spot treatment, I will see any blemish disappear after 2-3 days of use, morning and night.</li>
            <li> I would give it five starts, but it didn&#x27;t work well for my skin. I would still get random acne breakouts after using this. However, it did wonders for my fiance. He uses it everyday and it&#x27;s really cleared up his cystic acne.</li>
            <li> By far the best thing we&#x27;ve found for my daughters skin problems.</li>
            <li> We have tried Proactive and prescription acne medicine and this worked best.</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff! I get moderate back acne. I use a salicylic acid moisturizer which keeps my skin pretty smooth and blackhead free. But I would get occasional pimples still. This lotion keeps them from popping up! It can be drying as it is very potent. But personally it&#x27;s not a problem for me since I use it on my thick back skin and follow with a salicylic acid moisturizer.</li>
