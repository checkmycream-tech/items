    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i think because of its caffeine content, it kind of makes me nauseous and then quite hungry. cant return it now, coz i was lazy and 30days have passed. but thats that.</li>
            <li> I was looking for honest reviews of Slimmetry and I find the ones on Amazon were not very helpful or for some reason, I didn&#x27;t find them to be very detailed or truthful or people have taken it with other supplements. Plus, I never know if the reviews are written by Amway sales people, you know? I just wanted to know if it&#x27;s good enough by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through about 3 bottles of Slimmetry so I&#x27;ve been taking it for three months straight.  I&#x27;ve lost probably 5 pounds, which is a miracle for me.  I work out about five days a week and I consider myself to be fit, but not marathon or triathlon fit.  Let&#x27;s say I can run 3 miles at 30 minutes without dying.  My problem was that I would get a huge appetite after burning all my calories at the gym. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t eating enough lean protein so I ate more lean chicken breast.  I saw some results but not much.  Keep in mind, I don&#x27;t eat fast food much, nor do I eat out at restaurants more than 1-2 times each week.  And I&#x27;ve been avoiding wheat and gluten even though I do have maybe one or two sandwiches a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while using Slimmetry, I&#x27;ve been doing my exact same work outs and I&#x27;m seeing faster results!  I can tell my appetite is suppressed and I love feeling full with eating just half of a regular portion at a restaurant.  I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t crave as much fatty foods as I used to.  As for side effects, I was worried the caffeine might keep me up at night because I don&#x27;t drink coffee or sodas or caffeinated teas.  For the first few days, I felt the caffeine in my system but after that, I feel like my normal self.  Sometimes I do get a tummy upset and have to visit the ladies room.  However, I don&#x27;t mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a miracle pill.  Though I do wonder if I would still lose the weight without as much exercise.  I think I probably would but exercise makes me feel good all around so I can&#x27;t give it up.  The only other diet supplement I&#x27;ve tried is raspberry ketones. It suppressed my appetite but made me pee like never before!  I&#x27;ll be using two more bottles of Slimmetry and see if I reach my ideal weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative for me is the price!  However, I think it&#x27;s worth it to feel this good about my body.  I&#x27;m 30 now and I want to look like I did when I was 23.  Losing weight at 30 is so much more difficult!</li>
            <li> I was given this supplement by my health provider.  It worked for me! I wasn&#x27;t as hungry, which helped me to make wiser choices in food!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using Slimmetry for about a month with a healthy diet. She has been losing about 2-3 pounds a week without even exercising. The product seems to be working. She does not have any side-effects and feels very energetic. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> Did not see any changes. I used this with carb blocker, which I know works. Tried this products for 2 weeks without carb blocker while eating the same and gained weight. Maybe this takes longer, but carb blocker by nutrilite worked that same week. Not sure about purchasing again, but will order carb blocker by this company.</li>
            <li> Good product. I love it. I use a half bottle of it and I lost a few pounds. It was very good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing its helping to keep me slim, but I don&#x27;t know.  My weight hasn&#x27;t gone down for months now.  However, I&#x27;m hoping that once this semester ends, I can devote more time to exercise and see if maybe that&#x27;ll be the resulting factor in getting this to work.  The pills don&#x27;t say that exercise is a must, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I felt nauseous anytime I took these pills. I never finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> Good diet pills. . I was 288 pounds,&lt;br /&gt;Now l am at 240. And still dropping more pounds to go...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  With a low calorie diet and exercise it work wonders.  It does not give me the shakes not does it make my heart beat uncontrollably like some of these other weight loss supplements.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using these pills for 3 wks now. I haven&#x27;t used the recommended amount on the back which says 2 tablets three times a day. Its mostly because I forget and when I eat breakfast Im not up 20-30 mins before I eat which it asks you to wait for. So I take around 2-4 tablets a day. I&#x27;m not solely taking these pills, I also work out 4 times a wk and eat lots of fruit and veggies. What I have noticed about these pills is they make me go to the restroom immediately after I finish eating if I took them before I ate. I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or not. I haven&#x27;t noticed any weight loss but trimmer ends and muscle but thats from the lifting not the pills. I probably won&#x27;t order again, Im sure I can lose weight without these pills.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend of mine. She has been using it for four (4) months and she has been able to get rid of close to thirty (30) pounds in approximately four (4) months. I would conclude that the proof is in the taking of the pills...would you not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS...She did adjust her diet and did not include daily exercise.</li>
            <li> Not a good way to loose weight</li>
            <li> These tablets are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persons using these must bare in mind that they work better with a low calorie diet. Very little exercise is needed, however, once exercise is introduced, the more weight is loss. Taking these tablets and eating large quantities of carbs will give no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increase your protein intake, focusing on lean protein mostly along with those fruits which are low in calorie (sugar). Drink plenty water (64oz + daily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have loss over 150 lbs on my weight loss journey!</li>
            <li> it was time and I  like product of nutrilite. I have time of using  them and it help me for losing weigh</li>
            <li> very good product, so i brought it again, i hope it work for me again, i just wish it was less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several Nutrilite products for around five months now - the Double X perfect pack supplements,  Slimmetry, Rhodiola 110 and Carb Blocker 2.  With an hour or so a day at the gym six days a week, three of cardio and three of weight training,  I&#x27;ve dropped over 50 pounds and gone from a 50 inch waist to a 40 and a 4xl shirt to XL-2xl, depending on how the clothing is cut.  For reference, I started in under armour compression shirts at 3xl, I&#x27;m now in a large.  Slimmetry is amazing for weight loss if you follow a halfway decent diet (I haven&#x27;t done a set diet, just stick to drinking water instead of cola,  watching  my carb intake a little and eating around 1700 calories a day of non fast food,  I don&#x27;t honestly keep a count).  I&#x27;ve found that with a combination of Slimmetry and CLA 800 (NOW foods brand which I get on here as well) that weight just falls off of me.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier...I&#x27;ve been so thrilled with the Nutrilite products that I decided to become a sales rep for them - what better than my own photos and success story to sell an amazing product that I fully believe in? : )</li>
            <li> Have not lost one ounce&lt;br /&gt;Use your wii power and save your hard earned money&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> It didnt Work for me.. I cant take so Many pills daily.. I could even complet 15 days and I was going to the gym and eating healthy..no change</li>
            <li> Lost 25 pounds using this and double X! In just 1-2 months ! Went from a size 7 to 1-2 :) I tell evvvvvvryone about this</li>
            <li> I guess this is too strong for me. I notice it that I was more hungry, yes it gave energy but i think because of all the caffeine. i have to mention that i was taking it with nutrilite glucose. so I have to stop it at that rate i was going, I would  it gain more weight because I was more hungry. I tried to return it the seller will not take it back. what a waste of money.:(</li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed this product, I do feel like it has assisted me in my endeavors of weight lost and I plan to purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> I used it before i liked it ,it was few years again so my sister was using it too she had a really bad pain on lower stomach..near the hips and she went to the emergency room but they couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was so I started using again last month and i had the same pain..now my sis and I don&#x27;t use it at all and she knows where the pain came from but other than that it works and u can lose weight...any-who ain&#x27;t going take it again</li>
            <li> I always love nutrilite and this product also didn&#x27;t let me down! When you work out and try to lose weight in good product, this will definitely help you in healthy way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a month now and I lose an average of 3 pounds a week. I don&#x27;t exercise and haven&#x27;t really changed up my diet. The only thing that could be helping me lose this weight is this product so try it out!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. And so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> At first it was working i wasn&#x27;t getting any appetite. I was also in a diet. I know about this product of a friend who lost  weight on it but on top of this pills she take other pills &amp; im the type who don&#x27;t like taking too many pills but it tried it. When i got it is basically 6 pills A DAY ! 2 in the morning before breakfast..2 before lunch and 2 before dinner. I couldnt no more &amp; besides when i do take it after a while i got nauseous. I couldnt finish the whole bottle too many pills that it finally got to me.</li>
            <li> I have not been very consistent when taking these but within the first week I did lose three pounds with exercise.</li>
