    <ol>
            <li>Great brush!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very good, quality brush</li>
            <li>She loved it!</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for me.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of the brush in my hand too!!</li>
            <li>This 960 brush&#x27;s finish also has a wonderful sensuous smooth texture!</li>
            <li>This brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been through many.</li>
            <li>felt like they were good quality and weren&#x27;t going to break off and 3)</li>
            <li>Amazing qualify.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice brush without ripping hair out or breaking.  </li>
            <li>Great brush and worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Truly this brush is better than using \\&quot;Johnson&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose very well, and happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like the Acca Kappa better because I preferred the softer, rounded handle design compared to the more angular Aveda handle.  </li>
            <li>my grip on the Aveda is better.  </li>
            <li>and she chose and got the better Aveda.</li>
            <li>Not terribly</li>
            <li>I do love this brush, however, if I would have known they were going to melt</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t tend to get static from it.</li>
            <li>I love the wood handle too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li>Good product, wide paddle which is great for long/straight hair</li>
            <li>I received it very quick</li>
            <li>Huge brush.</li>
            <li>were comfortable when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised about the number of good reviews for this brush.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more than I originally wanted to spend but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This brush makes it easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It goes through my medium length straight (decent amount of hair) very nicely</li>
            <li>The plastic wide-set bristles are great for wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush, appears to be very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very thick fine hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like much difference, but it means that the Acca Kappa is 30% heavier than the Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This brush, while a bit pricey, is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>so it stays clean and dries fast.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not planning to blow dry with it, then it is a nice brush, but I bought it for the heat resistant claim</li>
            <li>On dry hair the brush is equally as effective.</li>
            <li>weight of the brush is nice and the handle is good, but unfortunately I need a paddle to help with my blow drying.</li>
            <li>but I have to be very gentle.  </li>
            <li>brush normally retails for $80.00 and is far better than any Mason Pearson, Kent or Aveda brush.</li>
            <li>Its great for getting tangles out (even on thick hair), without breaking hair.  </li>
            <li>the first use it melted 5 of the prongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a quality product:)</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I was on a mission to find a large, sturdy paddle brush with pins that: 1) didn&#x27;t warp 2)</li>
            <li>As I expected, very smooth on scalp.</li>
            <li>While it does stand up to heat better than a standard brush after a month it is still showing wear and about 10% of the bristles are pointing left or right or semi-melted.  </li>
            <li>I have about three feet of long, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>so we have no complaint.</li>
            <li>Have owned an Acca Kappa for 14 years is still like new.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new one for fear it may one day be discontinued.</li>
            <li>Professional\\&quot; brush is the finest that they make in their \\&quot;Professional Collection\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>When I used both brushes with my hairdryer, I was surprised to see the plastic pins all started to warp.  </li>
            <li>However, I was in need of a brush that could stand up to the high heat produced by my new blow dryer and this one definitely does.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I finally found that in my new Acca Kappa 960 paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>far as lowest price goes, if you search with \\&quot;Yahoo\\&quot; you will find Amazon has the lowest price on this Acca Kappa 960 Professional brush, with drugstore.com coming in second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The balanced feel of this 9 1/2 inches long (total length) brush comes from its heavy exotic solid wood Kotibe frame.  </li>
            <li>Tangles\\&quot; with another high- end brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I tried to replace my worn out Denman brush with the same make and model (not the same, poor quality now) and also tried a Creative Products paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for well over a month and the heat-resistant pins have not warped even a little bit (the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on the other brush melted with the very first use.)  </li>

            <li> So I&#x27;ve always tried to find brushes with no little round tips on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I am using it with a 2000 watt hair dryer to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy/loose curl hair, so I brush it wet and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> (Not like the brushes that have those added bulbous tips that wear, or break off and get rough edges that will eventually rip your hair.)</li>
            <li> The wood is solid and the bristles are firmly fitted.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this brush due to the fact that it was more expensive than the brushes I have always bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> I know this is silly, but I also really like how it looks.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is approximately 3 1/2 inches wide and 5 inches long.</li>
            <li> (I have tried some of those other manufactures brushes and was not satisfied with the results.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on reviews of this brush, I took a chance in buying it even though it had those little nubs on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> This brush is too heavy at 3-3/4 oz.  </li>
            <li> It also seems that I lose less hair when I brush as compared to the brushes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> No More</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased such an expensive brush.  </li>
            <li> so I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I usually de-tangle and brush in the shower because the hair is so unruly.</li>
            <li> I would say there is approximately 1-2 inches between the brush and the end of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> You need this brush if you are miserable with loosing your long hair when brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush does not allow water into the into its base</li>

            <li> You need this brush if you are miserable with loosing your long hair when brushing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The tips on this brush are treated, so that it can pass through your hair without pulling. &lt;br /&gt; Truly this brush is better than using \\&quot;Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles\\&quot; with another high- end brush on wet hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This brush normally retails for $80.00 and is far better than any Mason Pearson, Kent or Aveda brush.

            <li> Love this brush, appears to be very sturdy and well made.  Serves its purpose very well, and happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Huge brush. Amazing qualify. Worth the price</li>
            <li> This brush is too heavy at 3-3/4 oz.  I prefer the Aveda wooden paddle brush at 2-7/8 oz.  It doesn&#x27;t sound like much difference, but it means that the Acca Kappa is 30% heavier than the Aveda.  I thought I would like the Acca Kappa better because I preferred the softer, rounded handle design compared to the more angular Aveda handle.  However, in picking up and trying both side-by-side (I bought one of each) my grip on the Aveda is better.  I let my wife choose the one she wanted to have to use and she chose and got the better Aveda.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this brush due to the fact that it was more expensive than the brushes I have always bought in the past.  However, I was in need of a brush that could stand up to the high heat produced by my new blow dryer and this one definitely does.  I have been using it for well over a month and the heat-resistant pins have not warped even a little bit (the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on the other brush melted with the very first use.)  It also seems that I lose less hair when I brush as compared to the brushes I have used in the past.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I am using it with a 2000 watt hair dryer to dry my hair.  I have been using it for over a month now and there has not been any melted bristles.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product, wide paddle which is great for long/straight hair</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my very fine, thin hair.  Everything tangles in my hair. Prolonged exposure to things that snag my hair result in breakage and split end.  So I&#x27;ve always tried to find brushes with no little round tips on the bristles.  They tend to catch my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews of this brush, I took a chance in buying it even though it had those little nubs on the bristles.  It&#x27;s a very good, quality brush but the nubs catch my hair as I hoped they wouldn&#x27;t. Not terribly but I have to be very gentle.  I hope over time there won&#x27;t be damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hair is the same as mine, I recommend that you keep looking for a brush with no nubs.</li>
            <li> This brush, while a bit pricey, is worth the money.  Its great for getting tangles out (even on thick hair), without breaking hair.  I love the weight of the brush in my hand too!!</li>
            <li> As I expected, very smooth on scalp. My daughter has very thick fine hair and it works perfectly. She loved it!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a hair dryer, this is your brush...the first use it melted 5 of the prongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the brush is nice and the handle is good, but unfortunately I need a paddle to help with my blow drying.</li>
            <li> Great brush and worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush carefully after reading several reviews and the one reason I purchase this brush was several reviewers stated that the bristles did not melt from the heat of a blow dryer.  I have had mine for about 4 months now and they have started to melt.  I do love this brush, however, if I would have known they were going to melt I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased such an expensive brush.  I do not let the hair dryer touch the brush.  I would say there is approximately 1-2 inches between the brush and the end of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice brush without ripping hair out or breaking.  I need to keep all the hair I can.  I never thought combs or brushes made a difference till my wife made me buy these.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for me.  I have wavy/loose curl hair, so I brush it wet and let it air dry.  The plastic wide-set bristles are great for wet hair.  I know this is silly, but I also really like how it looks.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  While it does stand up to heat better than a standard brush after a month it is still showing wear and about 10% of the bristles are pointing left or right or semi-melted.  Not the quality I hoped for.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush daily for months. It&#x27;s made to last. The wooden handle &amp; paddle are all one piece. Works great. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised about the number of good reviews for this brush. The pins are not heat resistant. They melted after blow drying my hair and I ended up tossing it in the trash. If you&#x27;re not planning to blow dry with it, then it is a nice brush, but I bought it for the heat resistant claim so I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the brush. It goes through my medium length straight (decent amount of hair) very nicely and I don&#x27;t tend to get static from it. I love the wood handle too.</li>
            <li> This thing worked wonderfully while spanking my daughter</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. I received it very quick so we have no complaint. Thank you for such a quality product:)</li>

I usually de-tangle and brush in the shower because the hair is so unruly. This brush makes it easy and quick. On dry hair the brush is equally as effective. The wood is solid and the bristles are firmly fitted. The brush does not allow water into the into its base so it stays clean and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I tried to replace my worn out Denman brush with the same make and model (not the same, poor quality now) and also tried a Creative Products paddle brush.  When I used both brushes with my hairdryer, I was surprised to see the plastic pins all started to warp.  I was on a mission to find a large, sturdy paddle brush with pins that: 1) didn&#x27;t warp 2) felt like they were good quality and weren&#x27;t going to break off and 3) were comfortable when brushing.  I finally found that in my new Acca Kappa 960 paddle brush.  I LOVE this brush.  Yes, it&#x27;s more than I originally wanted to spend but worth every penny.  Don&#x27;t look any further if you&#x27;ve been looking for the same things I stated above and get this brush!</li>
            <li> Have owned an Acca Kappa for 14 years is still like new. Just bought a new one for fear it may one day be discontinued. Have long blonde hair and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, it treats my hair like silk.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this on clients every day.  I would buy again and again.</li>
