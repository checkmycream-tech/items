            <li>I love and swear by this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the boldest, smoothest silver i&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but very soft.</li>
            <li>Stays put, sharpens easily, wears all day or night.</li>
            <li>This pigment give my eyes beautiful color love to mix this with other colors I will buy again!</li>
            <li>I love it that it has a high silver shine!</li>
            <li>Waterproof true silver eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I am so happy someone had this, because I can&#x27;t find it in a store anywhere near where I live.</li>
            <li>this is for somebody who is not shy of showing some eye makeup !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for lining the inner corner of the eye to open up your look or to underline the bottom rim of the eye for a special effect.</li>
            <li>stuff glides right on.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it is exactly as it is advertised, very high intensity pigments and metallic !</li>
            <li>but the way it looks is pretty</li>
            <li>Searched hard to find this and was given the best price ever only on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>Even at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>This looks, straight up, like liquid metal on your eyes.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I smeared the tip of it off completely!</li>
            <li>Such a cool effect.</li>
            <li>when they say high intensity pigments, they aren&#x27;t kidding:</li>
            <li>it seriously just glides, and its  a bright yet dark silver...</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product, One of the few silvers that stand out and is not too blue.</li>
            <li>This product, is dry, arrived open, and I would highly suggested it be avoided.  </li>
            <li>not flat.</li>

            <li> not flat.</li>
            <li> lasts all day, you only need to use a little bit and it highlights your eyes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep the sharp tip and when you sharpen it the tip stays round and ball like making it hard to apply a second time, It also flakes into your eyes and is a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if I have an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> etc - but not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a couple since they are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 5 - 7 times and it has broke at least 2 times since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Sliver pencil is very hard to find and brightens your eyes</li>
            <li> It is so dry it is painful to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> and I think this is one of the worst for that it won&#x27;t even stay on for 10 min</li>

            <li> I love the color and I am not sure if I have an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; pencil - but when I use it, there has been a tendency for the pencil to break.  I have used it 5 - 7 times and it has broke at least 2 times since I started using it.  I love the color, etc - but not sure if I would buy it again. Even at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look so nice!</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores.  ordered online and had it within days.  eye popping silver.  not flat. wears well and stays all day.  I ordered a couple since they are hard to find.  I have worn this pencil for years and am a total fan</li>
            <li> This looks, straight up, like liquid metal on your eyes. Such a cool effect. I adore it. Lasts all day, even only oily lids. I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product, is dry, arrived open, and I would highly suggested it be avoided.  It is so dry it is painful to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>

            <li> I love enhancing my eyes with this silver chrome eyeliner! It doesn&#x27;t matter what color eyes you have, it makes them POP and scream, \\&quot;LOOK AT ME!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Well that is so liquid I even don&#x27;t know how should I use it ! but the way it looks is pretty</li>
            <li> Be aware that it is exactly as it is advertised, very high intensity pigments and metallic ! this is for somebody who is not shy of showing some eye makeup !</li>

            <li> More of a chrome color, looks great!</li>
            <li> Waterproof true silver eyeliner. It&#x27;s great for lining the inner corner of the eye to open up your look or to underline the bottom rim of the eye for a special effect. Stays put, sharpens easily, wears all day or night.</li>
            <li> when they say high intensity pigments, they aren&#x27;t kidding: it&#x27;s the boldest, smoothest silver i&#x27;ve been able to find. great buy</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product, One of the few silvers that stand out and is not too blue. Stays on well, hightly pigmented have done 14 hr days and this stays put.</li>
