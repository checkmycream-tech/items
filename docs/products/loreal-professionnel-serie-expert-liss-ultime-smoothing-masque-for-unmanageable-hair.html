            <li>I love the smell and how it makes my hair so much healthier :)</li>
            <li>I received the conditioner on time but the bottle itself didn&#x27;t seem to be the original one.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>but I also bought same series shampoo, shampoo is much more better than this.  </li>
            <li>I bought the same product a year ago and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Really works to smooth the frizz.</li>

            <li>This priduct makes my hair so so soft, healthy and shiny</li>

            <li>After I cleaned my hair, I put this on my hair and felt my hair became harden, but after rinsing, it actually became better .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this same conditioner at my salon and it was outstanding, my hair has never been smoother.</li>
            <li>Great for African American natural hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bargain at this price for the large size.</li>
            <li>It came in a dark purple colored bottle as opposed to light color on original product.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on top of the line products to reproduce that soft, manageable and glass-like shine from-the-salon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you to try it.</li>
            <li>Both this and the Absolut Repair Cullular with Lactic Acid are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair, it makes me not looks like messing like before.</li>
            <li>With this masque my hair is soft and shiny despite the chlorine from the pool or the salt from the ocean.</li>
            <li>I used this product twice and could notice considerable amount of increase in hair</li>
            <li>Am very upset about it and the smell is a bit different.</li>
            <li>also ordered Loreal&#x27;s Professional Paris Absolut Repair Lactic Acid shampoo which I also used today plus 3 vials of Loreal Series Expert Power Repair B (which I have yet to try).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if your hair has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse, mostly curly, but, frizzy hair</li>

            <li> After I cleaned my hair, I put this on my hair and felt my hair became harden, but after rinsing, it actually became better .&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair, it makes me not looks like messing like before. but I also bought same series shampoo, shampoo is much more better than this.  shampoo was awesome.</li>

            <li> This is a lovely product, it  makes hair feel silky soft and managable . Highly recommended, especially if your hair has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product is comparable to its top shelf cousin, Kerastase, which is 3x as expensive. This priduct makes my hair so so soft, healthy and shiny and it smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. I have coarse, curly hair and using this masque has really helped to tame the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s a bargain at this price for the large size. was paying $24 at the salon for the half the amount.</li>
            <li> Got this masque as a free sample many years ago.  It was AMAZING!  Hair feels so silky after using this</li>

            <li> I received the conditioner on time but the bottle itself didn&#x27;t seem to be the original one. It came in a dark purple colored bottle as opposed to light color on original product. Bottle contained some shiny silver particles mixed with the conditioner. I could see particles on my hair roots after one wash. It made my hair bad. such a bad product..It gave a diff smell.. I used this product twice and could notice considerable amount of increase in hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Loreal liss Ultime since last 3 years and never experience such bad version of it.. I would NOT recommend this to any one..</li>
            <li> I bought this same conditioner at my salon and it was outstanding, my hair has never been smoother. When I ran out, I purchased this one and its like they are two different products. My hair was just as frizzy as when I was using Dove or Garnier, no smoothness. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product- have been using it for years with great effect for my awfully dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the same product a year ago and it was amazing. This mask looks like it&#x27;s been diluted! Am very upset about it and the smell is a bit different. It&#x27;s either fake or they changed it. Don&#x27;t know. I feel like I wasted money.</li>
            <li> Great for African American natural hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best conditioner.  I&#x27;m back to using this again and won&#x27;t stray again.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  It makes my hair soft and smooth but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  I would recommend the shampoo also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have tried many, many products, and this is one of the best conditioners out there for fine, frizzy damaged hair.  Really works to smooth the frizz.</li>
            <li> Wow - just received this via Amazon just yesterday and used this morning - what a HUGE difference this has made in my styling routine. I have thick, coarse, mostly curly, but, frizzy hair plus I color my hair now that I&#x27;m in my 40s on a regular basis. I have spent so much money on top of the line products to reproduce that soft, manageable and glass-like shine from-the-salon-look only to be let down every time. I was not expecting to get my hopes up, but, the great reviews sold me on this, so I bought it. I&#x27;m so glad I did - I have tried Fekkai, It&#x27;s a 10, Coppola, Living Proof, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, etc. - the list goes on - and NEVER had the result that this conditioner has given me in just one use. Today is humid where I live and my hair still looks and feels great. I only left on about 20 minutes after getting out of the shower and then rinsed twice.&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered Loreal&#x27;s Professional Paris Absolut Repair Lactic Acid shampoo which I also used today plus 3 vials of Loreal Series Expert Power Repair B (which I have yet to try). I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found something that works like I want it to.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Even after using this conditioner one time, I can feel the difference in my hair.  Whn dry, it is not so fly-away and has a shine to it that I don&#x27;t get from other conditioners.  Both this and the Absolut Repair Cullular with Lactic Acid are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I only use a little, but the results are impressive.  So impressive that my husband decided to try it and HE noticed the difference in his own hair (that&#x27;s saying a lot!).</li>
