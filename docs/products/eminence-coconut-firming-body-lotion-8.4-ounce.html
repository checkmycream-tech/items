            <li>This lotion makes my skin feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing huge firming benefits but my skin feels amazing soft when I use this after exfoliating with the coconut sugar scrub!</li>
            <li>This lotion has a true coconut aroma and goes on light but keeps your skin plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Love love love this lotion I am getting a second bottle now because I have using this</li>

            <li>I love the purity of the ingredients and they all work!I love this one so far the best...and the mango face lotion.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion by Eminence for it is very hydrating and dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>feels good on my skin and again the Eminence skin care line is natural and has been good to my sensitive skin so far.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances; many trigger migraines.</li>
            <li>Bought for first time when visiting desert in winter.  </li>
            <li>I have never had much luck with lotions until I found this!</li>
            <li>Pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried regular store brands (i.e., Vaseline), and although they suffice, the quality of this Eminence body lotion is a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try some of the products in the Eminence Organics line after much research - I liked the fact they were considered organic without hidden additives.  </li>
            <li>Amazing cream really firm tge skin</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this lotion a is mild, natural coconut fragrance--NOT like the strong, artificial suntan lotion coconut smell--but rather a pleasant fragrance that does not linger after application.</li>
            <li>I do micro current also and it has made a significant change in two weeks....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion</li>
            <li>It goes a long way and does helm my skin feel smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Healthy ingredients, but so heavily scented I couldn&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>therefore I unscrew the top and put small amounts into containers with screw off tops.  </li>
            <li>I may just stick with the lemon cleanser &amp; buy a different lotion because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend that kind of money to take a chance on another yucky smell.</li>
            <li>I Use it all year round, and my skin is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again; just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>They are made in Hungary and are all natural.  </li>
            <li>i love the natural coconut smell - yet it is not overwhelming!</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>do like other Eminence products very much though.</li>
            <li>They are more pricey but do last a very long time because it takes less each time you use the product.</li>
            <li>I am not noticing firmness on my arms or legs but maybe a few weeks isn&#x27;t enough time to notice true results.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>

            <li> but it is a little pricey.</li>

            <li> The lotion is thick and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Been using this with carnosine and can tell a subtle difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> however the smell of the coconut firming lotion is not good .</li>

            <li> It smells wonderful, rich and creamy, but the main thing is my skin has never looked or felt so good. It&#x27;s absorbs quickly, no oily or greasy film. Bought for first time when visiting desert in winter.  I Use it all year round, and my skin is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing huge firming benefits but my skin feels amazing soft when I use this after exfoliating with the coconut sugar scrub! I just wished it had more of a coconut aroma.</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly, and definitely makes a difference the longer I use it!  I will definitely want it again! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love all of the eminence products, Smells really good and makes your skin really soft. Highly recommend this lotion</li>
            <li> Great smell and definitely helps cellulite. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky..just feels like silk on your skin! This has corrected my dry skin issue altogether! I have never had much luck with lotions until I found this!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It goes a long way and does helm my skin feel smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;m picky about the moisturizers I use.  I really love this lotion by Eminence for it is very hydrating and dries fairly quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried regular store brands (i.e., Vaseline), and although they suffice, the quality of this Eminence body lotion is a whole lot better.  My skin feels firmer and well-hydrated throughout the day.  I just wish they could have more lotion in the bottle (I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for quality).</li>
            <li> Quality lotion. Been using this with carnosine and can tell a subtle difference in the firmness of my skin. I only use once a day when I remember and I also mix it with another generic lotion to make it last longer. I am sure if I used directly and twice a day I would experience even better results. Still a little goes a long way. Scent is light, coconut with hints of vanilla. Personally I prefer floral scents. I will definitely purchase again; just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> People seem to rave about this line, but I find that it&#x27;s just OK.  The lotion is thick and moisturizing.  However, I question whether this line is actually organic and based on the ingredient list for this product, my guess is that it&#x27;s not, so the name is misleading.</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice feeling . I love Eminence products , however the smell of the coconut firming lotion is not good . I may just stick with the lemon cleanser &amp; buy a different lotion because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend that kind of money to take a chance on another yucky smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a true coconut aroma and goes on light but keeps your skin plump and hydrated. Really nice but it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> i love the natural coconut smell - yet it is not overwhelming! feels good on my skin and again the Eminence skin care line is natural and has been good to my sensitive skin so far.</li>
            <li> Nice Smell. Does it firm? Had to say.</li>
            <li> Healthy ingredients, but so heavily scented I couldn&#x27;t use.  Gave to my mom and she passed it along too because of the very heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I like this but I think I prefer the Monoi (also by Eminence) body lotion better. Feels and smells good. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I love all Eminence products.  They are made in Hungary and are all natural.  So good for your body and for your skin.  They are more pricey but do last a very long time because it takes less each time you use the product.</li>
            <li> I like the coconut firming body lotion okay. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money. Pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I do like other Eminence products very much though. I&#x27;ll keep trying their many products.</li>

            <li> I decided to try some of the products in the Eminence Organics line after much research - I liked the fact they were considered organic without hidden additives.  The major problem with this product is that it is so thick it is difficult to pump therefore I unscrew the top and put small amounts into containers with screw off tops.

            <li> Love Eminence, arrived on time and as described, would buy from this Seller again.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin feel fabulous. It is one that doesn&#x27;t get oily. But I am able to smell the coconut for hours after. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Eminence products are the best! great, natural skin care with quality moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strong. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion I am getting a second bottle now because I have using this and wow...my lines on my face are disappearing.... plumping up saggy areas...yes I put it on my face as well as body......I do micro current also and it has made a significant change in two weeks.... but nu face and this cream are working!!!!
