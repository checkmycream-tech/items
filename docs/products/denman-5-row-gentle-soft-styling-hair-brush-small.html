            <li>Thank you for your Superb Service.....</li>
            <li>Ideal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for my hair texture.</li>
            <li>Perfect size and goes through hair easily and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Love It!</li>
            <li>yeah, of course it&#x27;s a nice brush.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best detangling brush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The points are very smooth</li>
            <li>Going to order more of them.</li>
            <li>Works great for getting kinks out and is quite gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>The Denman quality is there, without question, but there should be some way the listing included a way to determine size more accurately.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much</li>
            <li>Now I have to press lightly else</li>
            <li>It goes through my fine straight hair smoothly and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I have decided to throw it in my gym bag to brush up my hair for quick fixes in case</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok , it works great for detangling your hair , I will buy a bigger one next time</li>
            <li>Great little brush!</li>
            <li>First couple times it hurt because I normally give my scalp a good going-over to prevent dander and loose yucky hairs ...  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I own 2 other Denman brushes, one with wider rows to De-tangle, one to finish styling.</li>
            <li>First off let me say that the shipping was extremely fast received this item within 3 business days...</li>
            <li>It styles without adding too much volume.</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The item itself does wat a brush is suppose to do and very sturdy..</li>
            <li>i recommend this to other Natural hair ladies and This buyer to get your Denman brush at a great low price...</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush pretty small though I should have got a bigger one</li>
            <li>I use this more than my other hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>no more crying which is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit small for my handling but overall a good brush.</li>
            <li>They wore off in about 3 years, so I needed a new one ...</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve always liked little brushes instead of combs or big brushes, and this thing is pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>The soft bristles make all the difference!</li>
            <li>I love it tho, because it&#x27;s small... and \\&quot;I\\&quot; control the pressure myself of how it feels, get used to it  ...</li>
            <li>I prefer this version over the regular Denman bristles and my hair is much happier.</li>
            <li>I use this denman brush for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair....</li>
            <li>Size of this one will easily fit in a small bag/purse/fanny pack ...</li>
            <li>And I could totally see this thing being used at the old barber shop</li>
            <li>My wife laughs at me because I spent $7 on a tiny brush, and I am a dude with pretty short hair.  </li>

            <li> I would buy it again for myself with short hair, but NOT for long hair because bristles are closer together and</li>
            <li> long  x 1 inch at widest area width ... bristles only, not including base are 3/4 inch tall, which is the reason I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good for long hair, it&#x27;ll tug/pull/hurt because of shortness</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair which means super thick with tight coils.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> long hair would have ho where to \\&quot;flow thru\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> Not soft and not gentle.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend it on very young children, as the bristles are hard plastic and the tips are NOT coated ...  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I cannot return it because it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the return shipping.</li>
            <li> Detangles wet hair</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no \\&quot;give\\&quot; to them ...</li>
            <li> I forget my other hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are very ridged as the taper is large at the base making the shaft quite ridged with no noticeable flexing.</li>
            <li> With a child, difficult to really know you are pressing too hard ...</li>
            <li> other brush was small, a 7 inch, and it had coated nubs on each bristle and could press extremely hard with no pain  ...</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t  scratch your scalp, but the rigidity of the plastic bristles makes it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is small as a travel size container of toothpaste and/or mouthwash!!!!</li>
            <li> very bad quality, deeply disappointed...</li>

            <li> Great for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Not ultra-soft pins as described.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it.  Just what I have been looking for and delievery was within days of my order.  Going to order more of them.</li>

The Denman quality is there, without question, but there should be some way the listing included a way to determine size more accurately. Sadly, I cannot return it because it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the return shipping. I have decided to throw it in my gym bag to brush up my hair for quick fixes in case I forget my other hair styling tools. If I had a daughter, I would&#x27;ve given it to her to brush her doll hair with.</li>
            <li> Love It! Detangles wet hair well!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best detangling brush that I have ever used. The soft bristles make all the difference! I prefer this version over the regular Denman bristles and my hair is much happier.</li>
            <li> I use this denman brush for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.... no more crying which is just wonderful.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair which means super thick with tight coils. I used this product to detangle my hair however I noticed that t was also defining my curls. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Great little brush! It styles without adding too much volume.</li>
            <li> I use this more than my other hair brushes.  Perfect size and goes through hair easily and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> very bad quality, deeply disappointed...</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use. It goes through my fine straight hair smoothly and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Its a bit small for my handling but overall a good brush.</li>
            <li> I own 2 other Denman brushes, one with wider rows to De-tangle, one to finish styling. I liked them so much I added a brush for my shoulder bag.</li>
            <li> Not soft and not gentle. I was taking a shot on this brush based on the description well the target moved. The plastic bristles are very ridged as the taper is large at the base making the shaft quite ridged with no noticeable flexing. The points are very smooth it won&#x27;t  scratch your scalp, but the rigidity of the plastic bristles makes it uncomfortable to use. Will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , it works great for detangling your hair , I will buy a bigger one next time</li>
            <li> The best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Grew up using this brush. Now my kids use the same brand. The bristles are gentle on the scalp. The size if perfect if you carry it in your purse.</li>
            <li> Extremely SMALL, exactly what I was looking for with my short, spiky hair ... I would NOT recommend it on very young children, as the bristles are hard plastic and the tips are NOT coated ...  There is absolutely no \\&quot;give\\&quot; to them ... First couple times it hurt because I normally give my scalp a good going-over to prevent dander and loose yucky hairs ...  Now I have to press lightly else it digs in ... I love it tho, because it&#x27;s small... and \\&quot;I\\&quot; control the pressure myself of how it feels, get used to it  ... With a child, difficult to really know you are pressing too hard ...&lt;br /&gt;My other brush was small, a 7 inch, and it had coated nubs on each bristle and could press extremely hard with no pain  ... They wore off in about 3 years, so I needed a new one ... Size of this one will easily fit in a small bag/purse/fanny pack ... I would buy it again for myself with short hair, but NOT for long hair because bristles are closer together and long hair would have ho where to \\&quot;flow thru\\&quot; ... Ideal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specs: overall length with handle 6 1/2 inches ... head only width 1 1/2 x 3 inches ... just the handle only is 3 inch grip space long  x 1 inch at widest area width ... bristles only, not including base are 3/4 inch tall, which is the reason I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good for long hair, it&#x27;ll tug/pull/hurt because of shortness</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush pretty small though I should have got a bigger one</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected...stiffer also.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting kinks out and is quite gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that the shipping was extremely fast received this item within 3 business days... Arrived in excellent condition and the packaging was on point well protected... The item itself does wat a brush is suppose to do and very sturdy.. i recommend this to other Natural hair ladies and This buyer to get your Denman brush at a great low price... Thank you for your Superb Service.....</li>
            <li> This brush rules.  My wife laughs at me because I spent $7 on a tiny brush, and I am a dude with pretty short hair.  But I&#x27;ve always liked little brushes instead of combs or big brushes, and this thing is pretty solid.  I don&#x27;t know anything about brushes but I suspect that people are like &amp;#34;well yeah, of course it&#x27;s a nice brush.  It&#x27;s a Denman.&amp;#34;  And I could totally see this thing being used at the old barber shop I went to as a kid.</li>
            <li> THe brush melted when I used it with thr blow dryer. I give it a 2 star because I can still use it.</li>
