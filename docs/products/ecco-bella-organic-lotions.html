            <li>Very creamy, and wonderful smell that linger which is what I like.</li>

            <li>costly, but worth it - the best vanilla lotion available</li>
            <li>I like the way the lotion feels but the smell of the vanilla is very strong and overpowering, will not order it again.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Instead of the beautiful vanilla scent, it smelled exactly like Play-doh.  </li>
            <li>A really good gluten free lotion.</li>
            <li>so much is that it is organic and good for my skin (which is the largest organ in the body!).  </li>

            <li>Guys love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Not only is this good for your skin it smells great too.</li>
            <li>I have found i get the most compliments when I use the Ecco Bella Bouboun Vanilla Perfume along with the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Water-free lotion is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to use it mostly on my hands during the day, after washing dishes and things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy, I make sure not to sit on the floor</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite lotion and scent for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>All natural, chemical free and the best smelling vanilla product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 20 years and have tried many others,  nothing compared.</li>
            <li>omg - I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have cut it with water to make it more &#x27;runny&#x27; and also allowing it to absorb faster.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The sales person there told me the exotic dancers bought it by the gallon</li>
            <li>I LOVE Ecco Bella lotion.</li>
            <li>I truly love the  vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It sure was mine</li>
            <li>and I am glad.</li>
            <li>I have to say I wish it came with a seal on it, just to make me feel better that it was never opened.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it is all I am going to buy from now on.</li>
            <li>I still tell him now, 6 months later (and bottle at 15% remaining) that this is the best lotion.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I have found to my favorite Vanilla Body Lotion by The Body Shop, which has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s eco friendly and all natural and the best vanilla scent I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it smells like vanilla cupcakes but is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is gluten free, keeps my skin from being dry and itchy, plus smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>I find it an easy lotion to use all the time</li>
            <li>but after a while the smell is not that strong</li>
            <li>best smelling lotion on the market and not to strong and just the right hint of vanilla and last most of the day also is the best conditioner for the skin and face with no reactions and leaves you not greesy and goes into the pours and doesn&#x27;t leave you messy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light body lotion, but it isn&#x27;t very effective for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It come easily out of the pump, and so smooth and creamy without being oily for greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a light vanilla smell, not to strong.</li>
            <li>I use it alone, or spray on a little Amarige de Givenchy and folks always comment on how wonderful I smell.  </li>
            <li>Always fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li>It lightly fragrances your skin in a light veil of vanilla that is yummy.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a non toxic gluten free body lotion.  </li>
            <li>vanilla is my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; and in my quest to replace as many of my household products as possible with natural versions, this has been the best.</li>
            <li>; I hope it is always available.</li>
            <li>The smell is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for years, my mother used to buy it for me as a child because of my sensitive skin, and its still my very favorite.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most potent and emollient lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I took off the top to make sure nothing looked spoiled inside (never know if you get an old product).  </li>
            <li>Overall this was a good lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it has no water, is not greasy and organic and keeps my skin very moist.</li>
            <li>So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I&#x27;ve never done any housework in my life.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, but my teenage daughter says it smells like Play Doh, which is kind of accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for people with only mildly dry skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts and doesn&#x27;t evaporate like cheap water based lotions.  </li>
            <li>My brother-in-law bought it for my Christmas present and he was worried it wasn&#x27;t THAT amazing.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase more before this runs completely out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pricey - but isn&#x27;t your health worth it???  </li>
            <li>I decided to try something different, and this sounded nice.  </li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and rich as it does not contain water.</li>
            <li>so I use it right out of the shower</li>
            <li>When I first put it on it has this strange smell, kind of a metallic undertone to it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It brought back so many memories of being a child and opening up a tub of Play-doh, and playing for hours with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing light fragrance leaves my skin feeling soft yet not sticky.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular creme for a long time and love it&#x27;s consistency and fragrance; very sensitive to most things, but this is very natural and soothing.</li>
            <li>I Agree with everyone&#x27;s  positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and natural but you won&#x27;t be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Sadly, those have more chemicals in them, and I was really hoping to love this since it&#x27;s more natural.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re left with this extremely strong vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I am making the switch to a more natural lifestyle now, and hopefully by doing so in my 20s, can alleviate some future health problems.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have tried that makes the sun damaged skin soft first of all.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions to get one that actually works on mature skin and keeps it moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>There is no heavy residue on my skin, only softness and more softness.</li>
            <li>I have never found a more complete, deep, and healing balm for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich enough for the winter and to be used as hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now.</li>
            <li>have to say if you have skin issues and negative results with breakouts and such, this might be you next best try.</li>
            <li>Fabulous lotion for hydrating dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Since you&#x27;re using less product, it&#x27;s not AS moisturizing this way, but still WAY better than any drugstore and / or scented lotions from the mall</li>
            <li>With most lotions, the first ingredient is usually water and that is not the case with Ecco Bella.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too.</li>
            <li>Great stuff but a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to hydrate and wear a scent that won&#x27;t be strong or annoying to others.</li>
            <li>but I live with it because of the compliments and the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and this is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>may purchase it again, not sure until I use it some more.</li>
            <li>Its is truly a natural wonder!</li>
            <li>enjoying it everyday!</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.</li>
            <li>But it came through the pump just fine after a few pumps to get it going.  </li>
            <li>I actually mix this with another, unscented lotion, which gives just a hint of the vanilla and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin that has sun damage.  </li>
            <li>If that issue were fixed I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on the natural, \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; vanilla scent all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sultry soft vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>The lotion worked for that reason and has a nice scent, but it made my skin slick all day long.</li>
            <li>Since my hands and feet are very dry especially during the winter I am purchasing full size bottle; one for work and one for home.</li>
            <li>I finally found a lotion with a scent I can live with.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Second, it keeps it soft all day!  </li>
            <li>The scent stays around for a long time but for use over the entire body it just ran out to fast for me.</li>
            <li>actually get compliments on the aroma from complete</li>
            <li>I credit this balm-like lotion (and regular exfoliation) with giving me the glowing skin of a 20 year old at age</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a long time for a good, non irritating, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t use it as an all over body lotion on a daily basis but I do moisturize my neck with it daily for the smell.</li>
            <li>....this stuff is super thick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so easy to get out of the bottle when the lotion is running low, but there are worse things in life to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have cut it with water to make it more &#x27;runny&#x27; and also allowing it to absorb faster.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> The sales person there told me the exotic dancers bought it by the gallon</li>
            <li> I LOVE Ecco Bella lotion.</li>
            <li> I truly love the  vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> It sure was mine</li>
            <li> and I am glad.</li>
            <li> I have to say I wish it came with a seal on it, just to make me feel better that it was never opened.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is all I am going to buy from now on.</li>
            <li> I still tell him now, 6 months later (and bottle at 15% remaining) that this is the best lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I have found to my favorite Vanilla Body Lotion by The Body Shop, which has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s eco friendly and all natural and the best vanilla scent I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it smells like vanilla cupcakes but is not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is gluten free, keeps my skin from being dry and itchy, plus smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li> I find it an easy lotion to use all the time</li>
            <li> but after a while the smell is not that strong</li>
            <li> best smelling lotion on the market and not to strong and just the right hint of vanilla and last most of the day also is the best conditioner for the skin and face with no reactions and leaves you not greesy and goes into the pours and doesn&#x27;t leave you messy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light body lotion, but it isn&#x27;t very effective for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It come easily out of the pump, and so smooth and creamy without being oily for greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a light vanilla smell, not to strong.</li>
            <li> I use it alone, or spray on a little Amarige de Givenchy and folks always comment on how wonderful I smell.  </li>
            <li> Always fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li> It lightly fragrances your skin in a light veil of vanilla that is yummy.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a non toxic gluten free body lotion.  </li>
            <li> vanilla is my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; and in my quest to replace as many of my household products as possible with natural versions, this has been the best.</li>
            <li> ; I hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> The smell is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, my mother used to buy it for me as a child because of my sensitive skin, and its still my very favorite.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most potent and emollient lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I took off the top to make sure nothing looked spoiled inside (never know if you get an old product).  </li>
            <li> Overall this was a good lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that it has no water, is not greasy and organic and keeps my skin very moist.</li>
            <li> So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I&#x27;ve never done any housework in my life.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but my teenage daughter says it smells like Play Doh, which is kind of accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for people with only mildly dry skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts and doesn&#x27;t evaporate like cheap water based lotions.  </li>
            <li> My brother-in-law bought it for my Christmas present and he was worried it wasn&#x27;t THAT amazing.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase more before this runs completely out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pricey - but isn&#x27;t your health worth it???  </li>
            <li> I decided to try something different, and this sounded nice.  </li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing and rich as it does not contain water.</li>
            <li> so I use it right out of the shower</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it has this strange smell, kind of a metallic undertone to it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> It brought back so many memories of being a child and opening up a tub of Play-doh, and playing for hours with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing light fragrance leaves my skin feeling soft yet not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular creme for a long time and love it&#x27;s consistency and fragrance; very sensitive to most things, but this is very natural and soothing.</li>
            <li> I Agree with everyone&#x27;s  positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and natural but you won&#x27;t be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating.</li>
            <li> Sadly, those have more chemicals in them, and I was really hoping to love this since it&#x27;s more natural.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re left with this extremely strong vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I am making the switch to a more natural lifestyle now, and hopefully by doing so in my 20s, can alleviate some future health problems.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have tried that makes the sun damaged skin soft first of all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions to get one that actually works on mature skin and keeps it moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> There is no heavy residue on my skin, only softness and more softness.</li>
            <li> I have never found a more complete, deep, and healing balm for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich enough for the winter and to be used as hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now.</li>
            <li> have to say if you have skin issues and negative results with breakouts and such, this might be you next best try.</li>
            <li> Fabulous lotion for hydrating dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re using less product, it&#x27;s not AS moisturizing this way, but still WAY better than any drugstore and / or scented lotions from the mall</li>
            <li> With most lotions, the first ingredient is usually water and that is not the case with Ecco Bella.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to hydrate and wear a scent that won&#x27;t be strong or annoying to others.</li>
            <li> but I live with it because of the compliments and the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and this is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> may purchase it again, not sure until I use it some more.</li>
            <li> Its is truly a natural wonder!</li>
            <li> enjoying it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.</li>
            <li> But it came through the pump just fine after a few pumps to get it going.  </li>
            <li> I actually mix this with another, unscented lotion, which gives just a hint of the vanilla and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin that has sun damage.  </li>
            <li> If that issue were fixed I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on the natural, \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; vanilla scent all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sultry soft vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> The lotion worked for that reason and has a nice scent, but it made my skin slick all day long.</li>
            <li> Since my hands and feet are very dry especially during the winter I am purchasing full size bottle; one for work and one for home.</li>
            <li> I finally found a lotion with a scent I can live with.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Second, it keeps it soft all day!  </li>
            <li> The scent stays around for a long time but for use over the entire body it just ran out to fast for me.</li>
            <li> actually get compliments on the aroma from complete</li>
            <li> I credit this balm-like lotion (and regular exfoliation) with giving me the glowing skin of a 20 year old at age</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a long time for a good, non irritating, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t use it as an all over body lotion on a daily basis but I do moisturize my neck with it daily for the smell.</li>
            <li> ....this stuff is super thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so easy to get out of the bottle when the lotion is running low, but there are worse things in life to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can smell it a little, and a normal lotion smell, but the play doh resemblance is so strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used and adored this Yummy lotion for Years!!&lt;br /&gt;Thick and Creamy with a long lasting Divine Vanilla</li>
            <li> I mean exactly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually works on my toughest dry places (elbows/knees/heels) and lasts for about 8 hours before the smell and softness begin to wear off.</li>
            <li> It works for dry skin but you should only rub it on dry patches.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent stays all day long.  </li>
            <li> The lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on...</li>
            <li> Soften my skin, conditions my winter dry skin</li>
            <li> for my dry hands, it did blend on, but didn&#x27;t feel as silky as some cheaper brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry hands...</li>
            <li> I smell like a vanilla cupcake, even later into the night as I lay down to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> and I wish it didn&#x27;t settle into the bottle and become harder to get out at the end of using it -</li>
            <li> It may be missing an element such as almond oil?</li>
            <li> I sniffed again, and again a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and this is only 70% organic, I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t just go all the way with it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy regular drugstore lotions to use on my hands and elbows.  </li>
            <li> may purchase it again, not sure until I use it some more.reason enough to buy</li>
            <li> I could see a line through the bottle where the lotion level can be seen, and when I turned the bottle upside down, the lotion didn&#x27;t move at all.  </li>
            <li> The consistency/texture has changed slightly.  </li>
            <li> a friend of mine says she smells a slight cinnomon scent in the air after I leave?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but it&#x27;s a moisturizer, and not full of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I tried just a little on my hands in case</li>
            <li> Your skin is your largest organ and it is porous, meaning the CHEMICALS in cheaper drugstore lotions literally absorb into your body, causing negative health effects down the road.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so although it may feel expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or if you can only use this during the summer, but it was so thick it literally looked like the consistency of vegetable shortening when you finally managed to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> Sometimes, usually when it&#x27;s freezing, it&#x27;s too thick to get out of the bottle with the provided pump.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a vanilla scent, because I&#x27;ve been feeling anxious lately and vanilla is a scent I like, and it feels comforting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so thick it almost doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick as others have said.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla is weak on me.  </li>
            <li> Is is however very thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those products I&#x27;m afraid will go off the market some day.</li>
            <li> Yep bet you didn&#x27;t know that artificial vanilla comes from Beavers.</li>
            <li> I have heard of some people cutting the formula with vitamin e capsules?  </li>
            <li> Is it just me or is it nearly impossible to pump any lotion out of the bottle?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get sick of the scent</li>
            <li> I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have water as an ingredient so doesn&#x27;t need any nasty preservatives to keep it from spoiling.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find.  I actually mix this with another, unscented lotion, which gives just a hint of the vanilla and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> Always fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a decade.  It&#x27;s wonderful for your skin and your senses and no mineral oil!  Try it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff but a bit expensive.  Very creamy, and wonderful smell that linger which is what I like.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smell so good.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the moisturizing lotions at bath and body works or VS. This stuff actually works on my toughest dry places (elbows/knees/heels) and lasts for about 8 hours before the smell and softness begin to wear off.</li>
            <li> delivered on time.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> A Big Fan!! I have used and adored this Yummy lotion for Years!!&lt;br /&gt;Thick and Creamy with a long lasting Divine Vanilla fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I actually get compliments on the aroma from complete strangers!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would prefer it if it was 100% Organic since I am an organic&lt;br /&gt;kinda gal, but I am so in LUV with the texture and Vanilla fragrance&lt;br /&gt;I just keep coming back to Ecco Bella!!&lt;br /&gt;Take Care All, Namaste,  Zoe</li>
            <li> Overall this was a good lotion. The scent stays around for a long time but for use over the entire body it just ran out to fast for me. It is good as a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. It&#x27;s rich enough for the winter and to be used as hand lotion. And it smells incredible. It&#x27;s one of those products I&#x27;m afraid will go off the market some day. Sometimes, usually when it&#x27;s freezing, it&#x27;s too thick to get out of the bottle with the provided pump. When that happens I cut &#x27;er open and put it in a jar. And I don&#x27;t mind at all, because this lotion is that good.</li>
            <li> I have  skin that is cancer-radiation treated and now permanently damanged. I had been searching for a long time for a good, non irritating, long lasting lotion. I took a chance on this one.  It is great!</li>
            <li> Fabulous lotion for hydrating dry skin. It lightly fragrances your skin in a light veil of vanilla that is yummy. Guys love the smell of it. It&#x27;s a great way to hydrate and wear a scent that won&#x27;t be strong or annoying to others. For me it doubles as a night creme for my face.</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells a lot like vanilla but after a while the smell is not that strong</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world. I don&#x27;t get sick of the scent and it&#x27;s actual vanilla not a biproduct from Beavers. Yep bet you didn&#x27;t know that artificial vanilla comes from Beavers. Well this product does NOT come from a beaver&#x27;s anal glands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to reduce the chemicals in my life, and I love the way this lotion feels (and smells!).  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a sample with mascara. I LOVE the lotion, great smell. Since my hands and feet are very dry especially during the winter I am purchasing full size bottle; one for work and one for home.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a non toxic gluten free body lotion.  I love this lotion, it smells like vanilla cupcakes but is not too strong.  It absorbs quickly but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t have water as an ingredient so doesn&#x27;t need any nasty preservatives to keep it from spoiling.  Is is however very thick so I use it right out of the shower so I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li> Always loved the smell of vanilla.Not only is this good for your skin it smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job. Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now. I have bought the lavender and the vanilla for my mom.  My aunt saw my arms and legs and asked how do I keep them looking so great! Ecco Bella i told her.  Now Ecco Bella is the only lotion she uses also.  A little goes a long way so although it may feel expensive it is worth it.  The vanilla scent stays all day long.  Even when I use a vanilla based perfume like Shalimar, it will fade but the lotion scent will come though.  I have found i get the most compliments when I use the Ecco Bella Bouboun Vanilla Perfume along with the lotion.  I use this every morning.  My skin does not feel the dryness I used to always experience.  My doctor told me to take care of my feet as they were cracking.  **blush** Last time she saw my feet she was impressed and is now an EccoBella lotion fan herself. My skin is so soft and supple.  Really the best lotion i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most potent and emollient lotion I have ever used. I love that it has no water, is not greasy and organic and keeps my skin very moist.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is water-free and organic.  Water-free lotion is so much better.  You don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts and doesn&#x27;t evaporate like cheap water based lotions.  The smell is wonderful.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just the scent and lotion I&#x27;ve been looking for. Ecco Bella Vanilla is amazingly creamy and luxurious. It&#x27;s gourmet lotion! I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin. The vanilla smells heavenly. It&#x27;s subtle and natural but you won&#x27;t be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating. It DOES NOT leave you smelling like a cupcake. It&#x27;s a sexy vanilla scent. I will purchase more before this runs completely out.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is all I have used for decades now.  It is gluten free, keeps my skin from being dry and itchy, plus smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light body lotion, but it isn&#x27;t very effective for my very dry skin. I&#x27;ve come to use it mostly on my hands during the day, after washing dishes and things. I like the scent, but my teenage daughter says it smells like Play Doh, which is kind of accurate. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for people with only mildly dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this lotion. When I first put it on it has this strange smell, kind of a metallic undertone to it. Eventually that goes away and you&#x27;re left with this extremely strong vanilla smell. It&#x27;s a bit greasy, I make sure not to sit on the floor or I&#x27;ll have to mop it up. Ultimately, I quit wearing it because I wanted an organic lotion and this is only 70% organic, I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t just go all the way with it. I&#x27;m pregnant now so I don&#x27;t want to wear something that isn&#x27;t 100% organic.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lotion and scent for over 10 years. I use it alone, or spray on a little Amarige de Givenchy and folks always comment on how wonderful I smell.  Yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but it&#x27;s a moisturizer, and not full of alcohol. It&#x27;s not so easy to get out of the bottle when the lotion is running low, but there are worse things in life to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My local store no longer carries it, so I&#x27;m getting from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I finally found a lotion with a scent I can live with. I put this on before bed and in the morning I still smell delicious.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion and lovely scent.  I find it an easy lotion to use all the time and I will buy this on a regular basis from this same Seller.  Nice job!</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome lotion on the market. All natural, chemical free and the best smelling vanilla product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 20 years and have tried many others,  nothing compared.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> omg - I love this stuff.  vanilla is my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; and in my quest to replace as many of my household products as possible with natural versions, this has been the best. find. ever!&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious (vanilla, but not artificial / cloying) and moisturizes for at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER....this stuff is super thick.  In the winter, that&#x27;s great.  In the summer, its uber-moisturizing qualities make it almost feel greasy.  I have heard of some people cutting the formula with vitamin e capsules?  I have cut it with water to make it more &#x27;runny&#x27; and also allowing it to absorb faster.  Since you&#x27;re using less product, it&#x27;s not AS moisturizing this way, but still WAY better than any drugstore and / or scented lotions from the mall stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s pricey - but isn&#x27;t your health worth it???  Your skin is your largest organ and it is porous, meaning the CHEMICALS in cheaper drugstore lotions literally absorb into your body, causing negative health effects down the road.  I am making the switch to a more natural lifestyle now, and hopefully by doing so in my 20s, can alleviate some future health problems.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I Agree with everyone&#x27;s  positive reviews. I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have (had) bumpy patches on my arms. The lotion worked for that reason and has a nice scent, but it made my skin slick all day long. It just wouldn&#x27;t soak into my skin all the way. Its defiantly one of the greasiest lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It works for dry skin but you should only rub it on dry patches. Don&#x27;t cover you body in it.</li>
            <li> This is so thick it almost doesn&#x27;t come out. Smells so good. You don&#x27;t need much. If you want to pamper yourself with some lotion buy it.</li>
            <li> costly, but worth it - the best vanilla lotion available</li>
            <li> I have mature skin that has sun damage.  I use only organic or herbal lotions.  This is the first lotion I have tried that makes the sun damaged skin soft first of all.  Second, it keeps it soft all day!  It also smells wonderful.  I have tried many lotions to get one that actually works on mature skin and keeps it moisturized all day.  This one does it.  It is the best I have found for softening my skin.  I will keep using this one.  Wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li> Is it just me or is it nearly impossible to pump any lotion out of the bottle? The lotion itself is very very good.....but it takes about 10 to 20 pumps to get any lotion out....I think the tube needs to be thicker. If that issue were fixed I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for over 15 years after I found it in a specialty store in SF. The sales person there told me the exotic dancers bought it by the gallon - I can see why - it smells amazing and feels great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was cheaper - and I wish it didn&#x27;t settle into the bottle and become harder to get out at the end of using it - but I live with it because of the compliments and the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Ecco Bella lotion. The smell is divine. I have been using this lotion for years, my mother used to buy it for me as a child because of my sensitive skin, and its still my very favorite. Its very moisturizing and rich as it does not contain water. I generally don&#x27;t use it as an all over body lotion on a daily basis but I do moisturize my neck with it daily for the smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, soften my skin.  It has a light vanilla smell, not to strong. Soften my skin, conditions my winter dry skin and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the way the lotion feels but the smell of the vanilla is very strong and overpowering, will not order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular creme for a long time and love it&#x27;s consistency and fragrance; very sensitive to most things, but this is very natural and soothing. Good for those who do a lot of outdoor work; I hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and this is heavenly.  The lotion goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle and added it to my regular deliveries.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I found this lotion through my neighbor 10 yrs ago. I truly love the  vanilla scent. The consistency/texture has changed slightly.  It used to be creamier. It may be missing an element such as almond oil? Not sure, but I still purchase it and love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich body cream with a enticing vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is wonderful. I don&#x27;t break out and it smells terrific. The smell does not get weaker as the day goes on, either. That in itself is amazing. I smell like a vanilla cupcake, even later into the night as I lay down to go to sleep. There is no heavy residue on my skin, only softness and more softness. I cannot smell the &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; part of this lotion but a friend of mine says she smells a slight cinnomon scent in the air after I leave?&lt;br /&gt;I have to say if you have skin issues and negative results with breakouts and such, this might be you next best try. It sure was mine and I am glad.</li>
            <li> I usually buy regular drugstore lotions to use on my hands and elbows.  I decided to try something different, and this sounded nice.  I wanted something with a vanilla scent, because I&#x27;ve been feeling anxious lately and vanilla is a scent I like, and it feels comforting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the shipment, I opened the box and it smelled delicious.  There was some air bubble packing, and the bottle was inside a plastic baggy, folded and taped.  There was no seal on the bottle, but the pump had not been used.  I took off the top to make sure nothing looked spoiled inside (never know if you get an old product).  I have to say I wish it came with a seal on it, just to make me feel better that it was never opened.  But that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla smell from just holding the bottle was very nice.  It reminded me of cakes, cookies, pies.  The lotion is thick as others have said.  I could see a line through the bottle where the lotion level can be seen, and when I turned the bottle upside down, the lotion didn&#x27;t move at all.  But it came through the pump just fine after a few pumps to get it going.  I tried just a little on my hands in case I get a reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put it on, I smelled something different than what I smelled earlier.  Instead of the beautiful vanilla scent, it smelled exactly like Play-doh.  I mean exactly.  It brought back so many memories of being a child and opening up a tub of Play-doh, and playing for hours with it.  I sniffed again, and again a few minutes later.  Still the same.  The vanilla is weak on me.  I can smell it a little, and a normal lotion smell, but the play doh resemblance is so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my dry hands, it did blend on, but didn&#x27;t feel as silky as some cheaper brands I&#x27;ve used.  Sadly, those have more chemicals in them, and I was really hoping to love this since it&#x27;s more natural.  A big plus is that this lotion is not tested on animals and uses no animal ingredients.  That is reason enough to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may purchase it again, not sure until I use it some more.reason enough to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may purchase it again, not sure until I use it some more.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I pair this with Ecco Bella Vanilla Bourbon parfume and the scent lasts all day! Not greasy at all and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years and nothing can even come close. It&#x27;s eco friendly and all natural and the best vanilla scent I have ever come across. People will complement you, all day.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry hands... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things. This lotion is a saver. It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff. So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I&#x27;ve never done any housework in my life. Highly recommended. I know it&#x27;s a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on... It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The reason I like it so much is that it is organic and good for my skin (which is the largest organ in the body!).  With most lotions, the first ingredient is usually water and that is not the case with Ecco Bella.  It moisturizes my skin so well and the scent is heavenly.  Thank you, Ecco Bella!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is all I am going to buy from now on. It come easily out of the pump, and so smooth and creamy without being oily for greasy.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for 20 years. I have never found a more complete, deep, and healing balm for my skin. I get compliments on the natural, \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; vanilla scent all the time. Boyfriends have stolen it to use post-shave, and it works as wonderfully on their faces as it does on my bod! I credit this balm-like lotion (and regular exfoliation) with giving me the glowing skin of a 20 year old at age 40- even after years in the California sun. Its is truly a natural wonder! I am a lifer!</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best body lotion I have EVER had. My brother-in-law bought it for my Christmas present and he was worried it wasn&#x27;t THAT amazing. I still tell him now, 6 months later (and bottle at 15% remaining) that this is the best lotion. BEST. LOTION. The texture is creamy and non-greasy; it sits on the skin for about a minute or two and absorbs. The smell is FANTASTIC. The smell alone lasts ALL DAY. I put this under my neck and I can smell it all day. It&#x27;s a sultry soft vanilla scent. I&#x27;m buying my second bottle now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love this lotion!! It&#x27;s moisturizing light fragrance leaves my skin feeling soft yet not sticky. This is the closest I have found to my favorite Vanilla Body Lotion by The Body Shop, which has been discontinued. And the price is easier on the pocket book!! Thank you Ecco Bella!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was terrible.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or if you can only use this during the summer, but it was so thick it literally looked like the consistency of vegetable shortening when you finally managed to get it out of the bottle.  Forget using the pump, because that was never going to work with that consistency stuff.  Once I smeared it on it just asphyxiated my skin in a dense layer.  I&#x27;ve used body butters and this a lot heavier and denser than those.</li>
            <li> best smelling lotion on the market and not to strong and just the right hint of vanilla and last most of the day also is the best conditioner for the skin and face with no reactions and leaves you not greesy and goes into the pours and doesn&#x27;t leave you messy. I will tell you from stopping at the Starbucks to going to the hospital and having a drink at a nice happy hour the waitresses love it and ask who smells so good</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> A really good gluten free lotion.</li>
            <li> i love the scent of vanilla!  and it is made of nice ingredients and it&#x27;s nice and thick!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m enjoying it everyday!</li>
