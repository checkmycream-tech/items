            <li>My favorite color of polish.  </li>
            <li>I take it with me to my manicures to make sure I get the color I want.  </li>
            <li>Does life get any better?</li>
            <li>One coat is perfect for a French manicure.</li>
            <li>I plan to get some flashier colors, but this is a good staple and would be great for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>minute).......then Gelish Top coat (cured 3</li>
            <li>I say!&lt;br /&gt;You can build more coats (</li>
            <li>up to 3 should look okay</li>
            <li>Not my favorite but a safe option.</li>
            <li>It goes well with many of my outfits and it lasts for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Gelish polish, I just don&#x27;t love this color.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and looks elegant.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li>Love the colour.  </li>
            <li>Love the colour of work.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more \\&quot;iridescent\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not...</li>
            <li>They have the most colors and it lasts the longest.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Two coats of top coat</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first Gelish color I tried on my fingernails at home, and definitely a good choice for a first-time effort.  </li>
            <li>I always use 2 coats of Light Elegant then 1-2 coats of Vegas Nights on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Light Elegant twice already</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Gelish Light Elegant.</li>
            <li>Light Elegant.</li>
            <li>Its the perfect neutral pink with just a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Also, this is for the full size bottle which is awesome because its the same price at Sally&#x27;s but for the mini size.</li>
            <li>Two coats of color (light elegant)</li>
            <li>Its very pretty, but more glitter than what I&#x27;ve worn in nail polish for many years.</li>
            <li>This color is the perfect pink!</li>
            <li>My nails will look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply even for the do-it-yourselfer at home manicure.</li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect non-flashy light pink.  </li>
            <li>It is more \\&quot;sweet and quiet\\</li>
            <li>Not too bright, not dull either.</li>
            <li>One day I&#x27;ll get adventuresome and get a bright color, but this is a great everyday color in the meantime!</li>
            <li>After fabulous, long-lasting results with a Gelish manicure from a salon, I decided to give it a go myself and try an at-home mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>but it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Second great color I ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smooth and it isn&#x27;t at all streaky.</li>
            <li>Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is elegant, but still fun.</li>
            <li>Very neutral color, nice for work or dressing up.</li>
            <li>One on top of the other is a great look.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the color and it is true to the little swatch on the screen.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shimmery opaque pink color.</li>
            <li>off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li>It is a pretty pink thats great for work and matches most clothing i decide to wear.</li>
            <li>EZ smooth application, and love the even coating of light iridescence over each entire nail with 1 coat!; doesn&#x27;t leave spots/deposits of more iridescence that you have to fuss with.  </li>
            <li>It creates a perfect soft glittery pale pink shade and it is beautiful!</li>
            <li>now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attached a picture so that you can see the true color.</li>
            <li>Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
            <li>So Sweet</li>
            <li>the gel is pretty easy to work.</li>
            <li>Gelish Sheek White is perfect for French manicures.</li>
            <li>quick delivery but</li>
            <li>the perfect pink, the sparkle is just a hint and not anything too loud.</li>
            <li>Perfect soft pink tone with a touch of shimmer.</li>
            <li>The color in the picture is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>that said, this gel polish is still a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>And this one is very beautiful color, solid light pink with a sparkle.</li>
            <li>Quality not that great product seems watered down</li>
            <li>I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it</li>
            <li>remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li>This one is extremely pretty and great for everyday or special occasions.</li>
            <li>I really prefer light polish shades.</li>
            <li>I did the same, except I did 2 coats of the Gelish Light Elegant, rather then</li>
            <li>&quot; rather then \\&quot;fun and hopping\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty true to the picture the maker provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put this under the June Bride pink glitter color and it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Great color very neutral with a hint of pink and sparkle.  </li>
            <li>Love it and ordered in many other colors.</li>
            <li>Light elegant is a beautiful pale pink with shimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it over colors for the sparkle factor, but it still doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>light colors are more forgiving when you are learning to paint your&lt;br /&gt;own nails after a long time of wearing acrylics, etc.</li>
            <li>The swatch shown here is not accurate, but the one on the Gelish website is perfect - the only gelish polish I own that is actually as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails myself and Gelish has been the easiest in my opinion so far.</li>
            <li>It has more sparkles to it than I generally like.</li>
            <li>After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover.</li>
            <li>Two coats was too much pink for me, so I took it off and started over, and one coat was perfect, it really helps mellow out the pink and look a bit more natural.</li>
            <li>It goes very fast.</li>
            <li>I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of</li>
            <li>I went to salon when I first tried it, got one manicure and decided to look online to do it at home.</li>
            <li>The durability and quality of this polish is exactly what you want and have come to expect in a gel polish.</li>
            <li>I loved this color for the first few days of wear, but then things started to turn, literally.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is not flashy and multi or silvery colored.</li>
            <li>choose this color as my first to attempt DIY soak off gel nail polish</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>By itself it is a pretty color-</li>
            <li>If your too white try self bronze on hands to make the color pop:)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so so so pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pink shimmery color but its not my kind of pink.</li>
            <li>I did not expect the silver shimmer undertone from the picture but really like it anyways!</li>
            <li>The color is not very pronounced, but it looks elegant, sophisticated and mature.</li>
            <li>This is my everyday color, it is so pretty, nice light pink with very fine glitter..</li>
            <li>I always put on two layers, and it is a more opaque pink color with very fine glitters, which is slightly different than what I imagined, based on the product picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails.</li>
            <li>- I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It</li>
            <li>Very sweet and simple ...matches everything and amost a skin tone color .</li>
            <li>This would be a great, very sheer color for a job interview, or if you want to go a step above a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>With 2 coats the pink is just slightly more pronounced and appears more solid.</li>
            <li>Personally, I can only barely tell that it&#x27;s pink, it looks more like a sparkly nude, but if you&#x27;re looking for something pretty but somewhat natural, I think this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I used 3 coats and it&#x27;s so pale pink with the shimmery fine glitter ... such an awesome nail color...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and glittery, but light enough to hide imperfections in your technique.</li>
            <li>a very light shimmery pink.</li>
            <li>The pink almost seems to have lilac tones and isn&#x27;t the most flattering on my slightly-olive skin.  </li>
            <li>However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges.</li>
            <li>Two coats is a cute girlie sparkly pink.</li>
            <li>It is very sparkly.</li>
            <li>I see that&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li>look with smooth out by 2nd</li>
            <li>I really like color.</li>
            <li>Sheer, light, translucent, iridescent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li>Some sparkle, not to much, and some transparency.  </li>
            <li>(To be fair, the nail tech who did my put it on WAY too thick and over the cuticle, so</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly easy (though time consuming) and the results look far better than my usual at-home manicure efforts.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that it is good practice to open the bottle and check the color before purchasing.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, pale pink color with shimmer.  </li>
            <li>and I personally like a little more visible color on my toes (thus the two coats of the Gelish Light Elegant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is easy just be sure to apply it thin...</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light, sparkly, and pretty pink!</li>
            <li>But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li>I love that it is semi-sheer so you can use it over other colors for a little extra sparkle or you can layer on many coats (4 coats for me) to get a true to bottle shade.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect pale pink with TINY flecks of shimmer (no glitter).</li>
            <li>Less is better.</li>
            <li>For some reason this particular color shrinks away from the edges after uv treating.  </li>
            <li>Highly suggest Vegas Nights with it.</li>
            <li>Lightly sparkly pink.</li>
            <li>I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li>Just light pink, with lots of sparkles.</li>
            <li>so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing</li>
            <li>I prefer using only one thin coat for every day, whereby the color is clean and sheer yet nicely sparkly and fun.</li>
            <li>Very, light glittery sheer pink.</li>
            <li>It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like a dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if its an old bottle or this particular color.</li>
            <li>Soft pink, light shimmer.</li>
            <li>I really like it because of it&#x27;s delicate, elegant, sweet pink color.  </li>
            <li>Lovely alternative to just using plain clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is easy, long lasting (2 weeks)</li>
            <li>This is a great baby pink color with some subtle shimmer.  </li>
            <li>wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li>The glitter finish makes it last a long time, and the light color means that you can go weeks before you need to re-do your manicure.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks.</li>
            <li>Very pretty glittery pink color.  </li>
            <li>A little thicker, so apply with a light touch.  </li>
            <li>I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li>I like it because it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I only use the harmony gelish line of gel polish products and really like the durability, choice of colors and ease of use.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 coats to get complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is a classy color and this product works well.</li>
            <li>Very shimmering but not big glitter !!</li>
            <li>That gorgeous pale pink started to fade to YELLOW over the course of two weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this color because it&#x27;s not bright and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Gelish has lasted me no less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This color/brand combination require multiple coats to look decent.</li>
            <li>you paint it but a more little difficult to see when painting your&lt;br /&gt;nails. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more sheer because I wanted to use it for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>I guess I expected it to be a more lighter pink shade but not too sheer.</li>
            <li>but this one is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This color came out way more bublegum pinkish than I was expecting (hard to tell when you&#x27;re making a decision based of a computer screen!)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li>If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice color that is not too flashy but can be noticed.</li>
            <li>after 4 days it has gone from pink to a real yucky yellow tannish look.</li>
            <li>2 minutes in a 36 watt uv light for each layer (base, 2 color coats, and foundation top it off) and that is it.</li>
            <li>my hands I painted; one Gelish base coat (cured 1 minute).......then one Gelish Light Elegant coat (cured 2 minutes)</li>
            <li>This was my first relish color purchased, and I wanted something neutral for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>This gel polish is a very pretty lighter pink with a slight sheen to it.</li>
            <li>flat with no sparkles and light, pale pink.</li>
            <li>Next time I might try 3 coats, because 2 is pretty pale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pale pink.</li>
            <li>I use this when doing a French manicure--it gives it a little extra kick (and shine) and really sets off the white of the nail edge.</li>

            <li> Wash hands good to remove all the cuticle remover.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>

            <li> I love this color!</li>
            <li> I simply love this color !  </li>
            <li> It kind of grows on you..</li>
            <li> After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n</li>
            <li> But it was still a really nice color.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice shimmer to it too.  </li>

            <li> love gelish.</li>
            <li> My favorite color of polish.  </li>
            <li> I take it with me to my manicures to make sure I get the color I want.  </li>
            <li> Does life get any better?</li>
            <li> One coat is perfect for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> I plan to get some flashier colors, but this is a good staple and would be great for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> minute).......then Gelish Top coat (cured 3</li>
            <li> I say!&lt;br /&gt;You can build more coats (</li>
            <li> up to 3 should look okay</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but a safe option.</li>
            <li> It goes well with many of my outfits and it lasts for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Gelish polish, I just don&#x27;t love this color.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and looks elegant.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li> Love the colour.  </li>
            <li> Love the colour of work.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more \\&quot;iridescent\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not...</li>
            <li> They have the most colors and it lasts the longest.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Two coats of top coat</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first Gelish color I tried on my fingernails at home, and definitely a good choice for a first-time effort.  </li>
            <li> I always use 2 coats of Light Elegant then 1-2 coats of Vegas Nights on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Light Elegant twice already</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Gelish Light Elegant.</li>
            <li> Light Elegant.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect neutral pink with just a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Also, this is for the full size bottle which is awesome because its the same price at Sally&#x27;s but for the mini size.</li>
            <li> Two coats of color (light elegant)</li>
            <li> Its very pretty, but more glitter than what I&#x27;ve worn in nail polish for many years.</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect pink!</li>
            <li> My nails will look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply even for the do-it-yourselfer at home manicure.</li>
            <li> Easy application.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect non-flashy light pink.  </li>
            <li> It is more \\&quot;sweet and quiet\\</li>
            <li> Not too bright, not dull either.</li>
            <li> One day I&#x27;ll get adventuresome and get a bright color, but this is a great everyday color in the meantime!</li>
            <li> After fabulous, long-lasting results with a Gelish manicure from a salon, I decided to give it a go myself and try an at-home mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> but it was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Second great color I ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes on perfectly smooth and it isn&#x27;t at all streaky.</li>
            <li> Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is elegant, but still fun.</li>
            <li> Very neutral color, nice for work or dressing up.</li>
            <li> One on top of the other is a great look.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the color and it is true to the little swatch on the screen.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shimmery opaque pink color.</li>
            <li> off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li> It is a pretty pink thats great for work and matches most clothing i decide to wear.</li>
            <li> EZ smooth application, and love the even coating of light iridescence over each entire nail with 1 coat!; doesn&#x27;t leave spots/deposits of more iridescence that you have to fuss with.  </li>
            <li> It creates a perfect soft glittery pale pink shade and it is beautiful!</li>
            <li> now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached a picture so that you can see the true color.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
            <li> So Sweet</li>
            <li> the gel is pretty easy to work.</li>
            <li> Gelish Sheek White is perfect for French manicures.</li>
            <li> quick delivery but</li>
            <li> the perfect pink, the sparkle is just a hint and not anything too loud.</li>
            <li> Perfect soft pink tone with a touch of shimmer.</li>
            <li> The color in the picture is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> that said, this gel polish is still a very pretty color.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> And this one is very beautiful color, solid light pink with a sparkle.</li>
            <li> Quality not that great product seems watered down</li>
            <li> I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it</li>
            <li> remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li> This one is extremely pretty and great for everyday or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I really prefer light polish shades.</li>
            <li> I did the same, except I did 2 coats of the Gelish Light Elegant, rather then</li>
            <li> &quot; rather then \\&quot;fun and hopping\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty true to the picture the maker provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this under the June Bride pink glitter color and it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Great color very neutral with a hint of pink and sparkle.  </li>
            <li> Love it and ordered in many other colors.</li>
            <li> Light elegant is a beautiful pale pink with shimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it over colors for the sparkle factor, but it still doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> light colors are more forgiving when you are learning to paint your&lt;br /&gt;own nails after a long time of wearing acrylics, etc.</li>
            <li> The swatch shown here is not accurate, but the one on the Gelish website is perfect - the only gelish polish I own that is actually as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails myself and Gelish has been the easiest in my opinion so far.</li>
            <li> It has more sparkles to it than I generally like.</li>
            <li> After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover.</li>
            <li> Two coats was too much pink for me, so I took it off and started over, and one coat was perfect, it really helps mellow out the pink and look a bit more natural.</li>
            <li> It goes very fast.</li>
            <li> I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of</li>
            <li> I went to salon when I first tried it, got one manicure and decided to look online to do it at home.</li>
            <li> The durability and quality of this polish is exactly what you want and have come to expect in a gel polish.</li>
            <li> I loved this color for the first few days of wear, but then things started to turn, literally.</li>
            <li> The sparkle is not flashy and multi or silvery colored.</li>
            <li> choose this color as my first to attempt DIY soak off gel nail polish</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li> By itself it is a pretty color-</li>
            <li> If your too white try self bronze on hands to make the color pop:)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so so so pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pink shimmery color but its not my kind of pink.</li>
            <li> I did not expect the silver shimmer undertone from the picture but really like it anyways!</li>
            <li> The color is not very pronounced, but it looks elegant, sophisticated and mature.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday color, it is so pretty, nice light pink with very fine glitter..</li>
            <li> I always put on two layers, and it is a more opaque pink color with very fine glitters, which is slightly different than what I imagined, based on the product picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails.</li>
            <li> - I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It</li>
            <li> Very sweet and simple ...matches everything and amost a skin tone color .</li>
            <li> This would be a great, very sheer color for a job interview, or if you want to go a step above a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> With 2 coats the pink is just slightly more pronounced and appears more solid.</li>
            <li> Personally, I can only barely tell that it&#x27;s pink, it looks more like a sparkly nude, but if you&#x27;re looking for something pretty but somewhat natural, I think this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I used 3 coats and it&#x27;s so pale pink with the shimmery fine glitter ... such an awesome nail color...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and glittery, but light enough to hide imperfections in your technique.</li>
            <li> a very light shimmery pink.</li>
            <li> The pink almost seems to have lilac tones and isn&#x27;t the most flattering on my slightly-olive skin.  </li>
            <li> However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges.</li>
            <li> Two coats is a cute girlie sparkly pink.</li>
            <li> It is very sparkly.</li>
            <li> I see that&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li> look with smooth out by 2nd</li>
            <li> I really like color.</li>
            <li> Sheer, light, translucent, iridescent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li> Some sparkle, not to much, and some transparency.  </li>
            <li> (To be fair, the nail tech who did my put it on WAY too thick and over the cuticle, so</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly easy (though time consuming) and the results look far better than my usual at-home manicure efforts.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that it is good practice to open the bottle and check the color before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, pale pink color with shimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I personally like a little more visible color on my toes (thus the two coats of the Gelish Light Elegant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is easy just be sure to apply it thin...</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, sparkly, and pretty pink!</li>
            <li> But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li> I love that it is semi-sheer so you can use it over other colors for a little extra sparkle or you can layer on many coats (4 coats for me) to get a true to bottle shade.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect pale pink with TINY flecks of shimmer (no glitter).</li>
            <li> Less is better.</li>
            <li> For some reason this particular color shrinks away from the edges after uv treating.  </li>
            <li> Highly suggest Vegas Nights with it.</li>
            <li> Lightly sparkly pink.</li>
            <li> I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li> Just light pink, with lots of sparkles.</li>
            <li> so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing</li>
            <li> I prefer using only one thin coat for every day, whereby the color is clean and sheer yet nicely sparkly and fun.</li>
            <li> Very, light glittery sheer pink.</li>
            <li> It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like a dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if its an old bottle or this particular color.</li>
            <li> Soft pink, light shimmer.</li>
            <li> I really like it because of it&#x27;s delicate, elegant, sweet pink color.  </li>
            <li> Lovely alternative to just using plain clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It is easy, long lasting (2 weeks)</li>
            <li> This is a great baby pink color with some subtle shimmer.  </li>
            <li> wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li> The glitter finish makes it last a long time, and the light color means that you can go weeks before you need to re-do your manicure.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks.</li>
            <li> Very pretty glittery pink color.  </li>
            <li> A little thicker, so apply with a light touch.  </li>
            <li> I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li> I like it because it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I only use the harmony gelish line of gel polish products and really like the durability, choice of colors and ease of use.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 coats to get complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> It is a classy color and this product works well.</li>
            <li> Very shimmering but not big glitter !!</li>
            <li> That gorgeous pale pink started to fade to YELLOW over the course of two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this color because it&#x27;s not bright and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Gelish has lasted me no less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This color/brand combination require multiple coats to look decent.</li>
            <li> you paint it but a more little difficult to see when painting your&lt;br /&gt;nails. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more sheer because I wanted to use it for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected it to be a more lighter pink shade but not too sheer.</li>
            <li> but this one is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This color came out way more bublegum pinkish than I was expecting (hard to tell when you&#x27;re making a decision based of a computer screen!)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li> If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color that is not too flashy but can be noticed.</li>
            <li> after 4 days it has gone from pink to a real yucky yellow tannish look.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes in a 36 watt uv light for each layer (base, 2 color coats, and foundation top it off) and that is it.</li>
            <li> my hands I painted; one Gelish base coat (cured 1 minute).......then one Gelish Light Elegant coat (cured 2 minutes)</li>
            <li> This was my first relish color purchased, and I wanted something neutral for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> This gel polish is a very pretty lighter pink with a slight sheen to it.</li>
            <li> flat with no sparkles and light, pale pink.</li>
            <li> Next time I might try 3 coats, because 2 is pretty pale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty pale pink.</li>
            <li> I use this when doing a French manicure--it gives it a little extra kick (and shine) and really sets off the white of the nail edge.</li>
            <li> very light pink with very subtle shimmer (not big pieces of glitter).&lt;br /&gt;Lasts 2-3 weeks or</li>
            <li> Right now it takes at least 1hr to get my nails</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer...</li>
            <li> but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins</li>
            <li> This is a pretty, very pale, sparkly pink.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty color, but a little pinker and sparklier than I would prefer for an everyday neutral polish.  </li>
            <li> The container of this product is damaged so long term</li>
            <li> This is not a loud color.</li>
            <li> , shimmer is the same it&#x27;s just pinker, not bold, just simple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;as rock and dry when you finish the process.</li>
            <li> I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...</li>
            <li> Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n</li>
            <li> and finally I have a French Manicure without destroying my nails with tips or acrylic.</li>
            <li> do not love this particular color due to discoloration problems.</li>
            <li> The color is a soft pink with a slight shimmer, it&#x27;s very subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li> Soaking off the old gel polish and the drying time for each layer gets a little tedious, but the results are so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With Gelish, I had no chip on my natural nails for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Some Gelish polish is very thin in consistency and needs numerous applications to achieve the right opaqueness.  </li>
            <li> than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...</li>
            <li> I have used the Gelish Little Princess for a french manicure as well</li>
            <li> I chose it as a neutral, but it is definitely pink with quite a bit of shimmer, and I would say it is opaque (using two coats of polish).  </li>
            <li> It is like a bright/sheer pink.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying so</li>
            <li> not tooo pink at all .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a baby girl pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pale pink with tiny specs of silver glitter.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a pale pink that isn&#x27;t a flat color, then try this one.</li>
            <li> A little bit lighter than my natural nail color and a little pinker, with just a little bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this polish to any pink lovers like myself!</li>
            <li> Other colors have not done this.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t compare to other gel polishes that I have used.</li>
            <li> A washed out, antique-y, sickly but super sparkly yellow.</li>
            <li> I must say though its a little harder to remove than other colors.</li>
            <li> It has a white dense sparkle that is hardly noticeable...</li>
            <li> This is a pale, petal pink color with a hint of a shimmer.</li>
            <li> : They go about 1-2 weeks before they start to grow down and lift at the edges.</li>
            <li> I can do at home in a couple hours for so much Less $$$ than going to the salon for a $70 mani and pedi.</li>
            <li> it is a pale pink with sparkles and will go with everything!</li>
            <li> In the last 2-3 years my nails have been extremely brittle, thin and could not grow them at all.</li>
            <li> Very Very slight hint of pale pink.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and it is almost a skin-tone pink with shine, which is just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> coat is a little on the streaky side as it self levels and the&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this color, but it is a little see through</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of shimmer to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a little darker than I had thought...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all kinds of other gel products and they usually chip in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the salon prices for nails that only going to make them worse once removed.</li>
            <li> when it started growing out, it looked horrible and I ended up pulling it off on my own.)</li>
            <li> Pale and forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I only did one coat because I was afraid 2 would be too pink.  </li>
            <li> color is a very delicate pink with sparkle in it.</li>
            <li> : At the beauty store you buy a small bottle for almost the sameprice</li>
            <li> For the price I am not pleased with the quality of packaging.</li>
            <li> rays.&lt;br /&gt;You could also use fingerless gloves because your nails will be hard</li>
            <li> It is frustrating to try to see what the colors look like when they are all a little \\&quot;off\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so it probably needs at least 2 coats .</li>

            <li> I love gelish products. They have great colors and this is a great spring/ summer color. It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks. must have.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shimmery opaque pink color. Goes on like a dream, perfect for DIY-ers.  I&#x27;ve attached a picture so that you can see the true color.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the color and it is true to the little swatch on the screen. I was looking for something just like this to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Light Elegant twice already and I love love love this shade. It is the perfect pale pink with TINY flecks of shimmer (no glitter). I always use 2 coats of Light Elegant then 1-2 coats of Vegas Nights on top. O M G! It creates a perfect soft glittery pale pink shade and it is beautiful! I really prefer light polish shades. If you&#x27;re looking for a pale pink that isn&#x27;t a flat color, then try this one. Highly suggest Vegas Nights with it. You will love it! :)</li>
            <li> After fabulous, long-lasting results with a Gelish manicure from a salon, I decided to give it a go myself and try an at-home mani/pedi. It was surprisingly easy (though time consuming) and the results look far better than my usual at-home manicure efforts.  Soaking off the old gel polish and the drying time for each layer gets a little tedious, but the results are so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first Gelish color I tried on my fingernails at home, and definitely a good choice for a first-time effort.  Pale and forgiving.  I chose it as a neutral, but it is definitely pink with quite a bit of shimmer, and I would say it is opaque (using two coats of polish).  It is a pretty color, but a little pinker and sparklier than I would prefer for an everyday neutral polish.  The pink almost seems to have lilac tones and isn&#x27;t the most flattering on my slightly-olive skin.  Nice color -- but not the perfect neutral shade for me.</li>
            <li> In the last 2-3 years my nails have been extremely brittle, thin and could not grow them at all. I have been using Gelish for 3 weeks now and finally I have a French Manicure without destroying my nails with tips or acrylic. I refuse to pay the salon prices for nails that only going to make them worse once removed. Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it but it was no longer available. So when I found out about Gelish I instantly bought the basics for French Manicure. - I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It Off. I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to compare; my nails with and without Gelish: I started with no nail growth at all, because I they constantly broke as they grew. With Gelish, I had no chip on my natural nails for the past 3 weeks. Once I removed Gelish and let my nails breathe for a day, I instantly broke two of my nails completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAMP: I use a 9Watt UV lamp I had for years. It works perfectly, but it will cure slower. Instead of 30secs I cure each layer for 4 minutes. Once this lamp goes I will switch over to a 30 watt lamp. Right now it takes at least 1hr to get my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOAK OFF: Buff the surface then I use foil, cotton ball soaked with the Soak Off remover. I leave it on for 30 minutes (not 15 as recommended) just because my nails are so weak I do not want to rish the chance of hurting them. - After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover. My nails will look healthy and clean. DO NOT PRY OR TEAR IT. It will remove the top layer of your nail. - I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails. Then let my nails breathe for a while before putting Gelish on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: At the beauty store you buy a small bottle for almost the sameprice so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I now know about the Cleanser and the Soak off remover, I will probably not reorder refills. I will get 100% acetone for a cheaper price at stores it does not have to be brand name. It goes very fast. I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far. I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it Off. It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure. - While I did not try yet, I read you can sandwich regular polish in between layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY: They go about 1-2 weeks before they start to grow down and lift at the edges. However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges. It took a little while to get the hang of it. They may last 3 weeks with these but I do a lot of housework so they do go through a lot of wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Soak off: 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- White tip. - Though technically you should not, I find that I need to remove tackiness from the layer on which I am putting the white tip of Sheek White on. For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of solid white.&lt;br /&gt;- Less is better. Do not apply close to the sides and cuticles of your nail. If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later. The product will level a bit during curing.</li>
            <li> a very light shimmery pink. however. after 4 days it has gone from pink to a real yucky yellow tannish look. gross. love gelish. do not love this particular color due to discoloration problems.</li>
            <li> My favorite color of polish.  I take it with me to my manicures to make sure I get the color I want.  Not too bright, not dull either.</li>
            <li> OMG! Are you kidding me? This stuff is a miracle. Does life get any better? It is easy to apply even for the do-it-yourselfer at home manicure. I went to salon when I first tried it, got one manicure and decided to look online to do it at home. It is easy, long lasting (2 weeks) the gel is pretty easy to work. 2 minutes in a 36 watt uv light for each layer (base, 2 color coats, and foundation top it off) and that is it. I used just rubbing alcohol for the end to remove the tacky layer and I was out the door. Try it!</li>
            <li> The durability and quality of this polish is exactly what you want and have come to expect in a gel polish. The color however, is not. I&#x27;ve come to expect the color of the actual polish NOT to match the strip of color on the bottle. I agree with other reviewers that it is good practice to open the bottle and check the color before purchasing. This color is beautiful in the bottle. I love that it is semi-sheer so you can use it over other colors for a little extra sparkle or you can layer on many coats (4 coats for me) to get a true to bottle shade.  I loved this color for the first few days of wear, but then things started to turn, literally. That gorgeous pale pink started to fade to YELLOW over the course of two weeks. A washed out, antique-y, sickly but super sparkly yellow. What a bummer.</li>
            <li> I love this color! One coat is perfect for a French manicure. Two coats is a cute girlie sparkly pink.</li>
            <li> I used this for the base of a french manicure and think it looks great.  I only did one coat because I was afraid 2 would be too pink.  It is very sparkly.</li>
            <li> This was my first relish color purchased, and I wanted something neutral for everyday wear.  It is gorgeous with just a bit of sparkle.  I plan to get some flashier colors, but this is a good staple and would be great for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Second great color I ordered on Amazon. One on top of the other is a great look.</li>
            <li> wash hands if applying sun screen. we went to float the river and I reapplied sun screen on all the kids in our group and by the end of the 5 hours my polish was curing off.</li>
            <li> This color came out way more bublegum pinkish than I was expecting (hard to tell when you&#x27;re making a decision based of a computer screen!) Two coats was too much pink for me, so I took it off and started over, and one coat was perfect, it really helps mellow out the pink and look a bit more natural. I&#x27;m up to day 11, which is already longer than it lasted when I had it done in the salon. (To be fair, the nail tech who did my put it on WAY too thick and over the cuticle, so when it started growing out, it looked horrible and I ended up pulling it off on my own.)</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, pale pink color with shimmer.  The swatch shown here is not accurate, but the one on the Gelish website is perfect - the only gelish polish I own that is actually as pictured.  I am very pale and it is almost a skin-tone pink with shine, which is just what I was looking for.  It is frustrating to try to see what the colors look like when they are all a little \\&quot;off\\&quot; but this one is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality. The color on the jar was a bit darker than it turned out-after reading reviews I see that&#x27;s pretty normal. This is a pretty, very pale, sparkly pink. This would be a great, very sheer color for a job interview, or if you want to go a step above a clear nail polish. Personally, I can only barely tell that it&#x27;s pink, it looks more like a sparkly nude, but if you&#x27;re looking for something pretty but somewhat natural, I think this is perfect. Next time I might try 3 coats, because 2 is pretty pale. As for quality,it&#x27;s very nice, looks very smooth, sparkly and nice.</li>
            <li> I am including pictures with this review, one of my hands and one of my toes, and with this Gelish polish I used the \\&quot;CND UV Lamp Shellac 08200D\\&quot;, which I purchased here on Amazon and will write a review also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my hands I painted; one Gelish base coat (cured 1 minute).......then one Gelish Light Elegant coat (cured 2 minutes)......then i painted the tips with one Gelish Sheek White coat (cured 1 minute).......then Gelish Top coat (cured 3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my toes I did the same, except I did 2 coats of the Gelish Light Elegant, rather then just one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is a very delicate pink with sparkle in it. The sparkle is not flashy and multi or silvery colored. It has a white dense sparkle that is hardly noticeable...but still there. With 2 coats the pink is just slightly more pronounced and appears more solid. The pictures don&#x27;t show the difference well, but it is there and I personally like a little more visible color on my toes (thus the two coats of the Gelish Light Elegant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish Sheek White is perfect for French manicures. I have used the Gelish Little Princess for a french manicure as well but I prefer the Gelish Light Elegant. It all depends on what you want...this color is just as described...elegant. It is more \\&quot;sweet and quiet\\&quot; rather then \\&quot;fun and hopping\\&quot;...lol, well I hope this helps :-)</li>
            <li> Ths nail polish is a soft looking pink color.  It&#x27;s very dainty.  It&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like a dramatic look.  I like it because it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Very, light glittery sheer pink. (2 coats)&lt;br /&gt;Very durable as all the Gelish colors are. This one is extremely pretty and great for everyday or special occasions. Sheer and the whites of your nails show through. Great color, love it!</li>
            <li> See the picture I posted(sorry crappy cellphone camera) of this color applied.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty true to the picture the maker provides.&lt;br /&gt;A very light pink with very subtle shimmer (not big pieces of glitter).&lt;br /&gt;Lasts 2-3 weeks or until your nails growth necessitates a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard you can do a \\&quot;fill in\\&quot; rather than soaking it all off and&lt;br /&gt;redoing, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be used as the bottom color of a French manicure if you like a&lt;br /&gt;little sparkle in your bottom color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is easy just be sure to apply it thin...thin I say!&lt;br /&gt;You can build more coats (up to 3 should look okay if thin) if&lt;br /&gt; you wish to deepen the opaqueness and don&#x27;t worry if your first&lt;br /&gt; coat is a little on the streaky side as it self levels and the&lt;br /&gt; look with smooth out by 2nd coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose this color as my first to attempt DIY soak off gel nail polish&lt;br /&gt;as light colors are more forgiving when you are learning to paint your&lt;br /&gt;own nails after a long time of wearing acrylics, etc. It is forgiving&lt;br /&gt;after you paint it but a more little difficult to see when painting your&lt;br /&gt;nails. &#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a 36 watt UV lamp to cure each coat. I put sunscreen on my fingers&lt;br /&gt;below the nail and my hands before I begin to protect from UVa rays.&lt;br /&gt;You could also use fingerless gloves because your nails will be hard&lt;br /&gt;as rock and dry when you finish the process.</li>
            <li> Lightly sparkly pink. Not my favorite but a safe option.</li>
            <li> Light elegant is a beautiful pale pink with shimmer. It goes on perfectly smooth and it isn&#x27;t at all streaky. I plan to wear this color for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I love this color because it&#x27;s not bright and very natural looking.  It goes well with many of my outfits and it lasts for about three weeks.  This is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Gelish polish, I just don&#x27;t love this color. It is like a bright/sheer pink. It&#x27;s just not a good color. I&#x27;ve tried using it over colors for the sparkle factor, but it still doesn&#x27;t look right. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this color.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish! It&#x27;s a pale pink with tiny specs of silver glitter. You will definitely need two coats to make it opaque. Be careful when applying so you don&#x27;t streak the polish and got \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; on your nails (like I did). Its a summer color for sure!</li>
            <li> It looks slightly different from the picture. I always put on two layers, and it is a more opaque pink color with very fine glitters, which is slightly different than what I imagined, based on the product picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this gel polish is still a very pretty color. And it lasts forever! I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now and it didn&#x27;t chip at all!</li>
            <li> quick delivery but don&#x27;t like the color</li>
            <li> Some Gelish polish is very thin in consistency and needs numerous applications to achieve the right opaqueness.  This color is thicker and only needs one or two coats to get the look you want for your gel nails.  I use this when doing a French manicure--it gives it a little extra kick (and shine) and really sets off the white of the nail edge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first but I do now! It kind of grows on you..</li>
            <li> I really like color. I must say though its a little harder to remove than other colors. I had to soak for about 20 min.</li>
            <li> Love it and ordered in many other colors.</li>
            <li> I like this color, but it is a little see through so it probably needs at least 2 coats . I put this under the June Bride pink glitter color and it is gorgeous. By itself it is a pretty color- flat with no sparkles and light, pale pink.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday color, it is so pretty, nice light pink with very fine glitter.. I only use the harmony gelish line of gel polish products and really like the durability, choice of colors and ease of use. I can do at home in a couple hours for so much Less $$$ than going to the salon for a $70 mani and pedi.</li>
            <li> The polish was purchased to match the color of a dress I am wearing for graduation from college. It matches beautifully! I love it!</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what you need...looks especially nice if you have a tan or medi skin tone. If your too white try self bronze on hands to make the color pop:)</li>
            <li> The container of this product is damaged so long term this product won&#x27;t last.  For the price I am not pleased with the quality of packaging.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty.  It takes 2 coats to get complete coverage.  It goes on evenly and looks elegant.  It has a little bit of shimmer to it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Gelish (soak off) Color: Light Elegant. Sheer, light, translucent, iridescent. Very Very slight hint of pale pink. EZ smooth application, and love the even coating of light iridescence over each entire nail with 1 coat!; doesn&#x27;t leave spots/deposits of more iridescence that you have to fuss with.  I used 1 coat of this color alone atop Gelish Structure. Lovely alternative to just using plain clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this color! What u see is the color u get. This is my manicure routine for gel polish n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove all cuticles, I use Sally Hansen \\&quot;instant cuticle remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down. After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n than I use a spoon metal cuticle pusher to push back my cuticles n remover the cuticle that has grown on my nail plate all the way around my nail, sides included...do not cut your cuticles or the skin around your nail plate, that&#x27;s what causes them to split and become callus. Should NEVER touch any of the skin around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash hands good to remove all the cuticle remover.&lt;br /&gt;3. I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail n any remaining cuticle on the my nail plate only. This does not damage the nail plate n by using the E Drill it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...I will NEVER use a block buffer or file on my nails ever again. Since giving up the buffer n file and using the E file only, my nails n the skin around my nail plate has never been healthier. There is a video on YouTube on how to do a proper manicure prep before applying gel polishes n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shape nails with a OPI crystal file, filing in one direction only. Do not file side to side this will only rip your nails and do not file the sides of your nails at all, this weakens the nails support causing them to break. Tips only.&lt;br /&gt;5. I use a brush or nail duster to remover the nail dust.&lt;br /&gt;6. I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...than I apply the gelish ph bond air dry.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer...off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...so alway check all nails good before curing.&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture. I got this tip off the gelish web site.&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;10. Apply another coat of your color, again cure but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins n cure your 3rd coat 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;11. Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer. I usually put 2 coats of this on curing the first coat 2 minutes n curing the second coat for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;12. Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...never use anything cotton with your gels or regular polish it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;And now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> Love the colour.  Easy application.  A little thicker, so apply with a light touch.  Love the colour of work. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color that is not too flashy but can be noticed. It is a classy color and this product works well.</li>
            <li> very happy with Gelish from Harmony, lasts more then 3 weeks on my nails with no chipping at all! And this one is very beautiful color, solid light pink with a sparkle.</li>
            <li> Just light pink, with lots of sparkles. I thought it would be more \\&quot;iridescent\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not...it has glitter. Its very pretty, but more glitter than what I&#x27;ve worn in nail polish for many years. Good value though.  Anyone know how the \\&quot;soak off\\&quot; works?</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color for your first try at Gel nails at home. It&#x27;s pretty and glittery, but light enough to hide imperfections in your technique. The glitter finish makes it last a long time, and the light color means that you can go weeks before you need to re-do your manicure.</li>
            <li> I am a brown-skinned African American (about Sanaa Lanthan complexion). This is the perfect conservative color for me. A little bit lighter than my natural nail color and a little pinker, with just a little bit of shimmer. One day I&#x27;ll get adventuresome and get a bright color, but this is a great everyday color in the meantime! Lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great baby pink color with some subtle shimmer.  This is not a loud color. It is a pretty pink thats great for work and matches most clothing i decide to wear.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, Harmony Gelish Gel Polish is a great Product. I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon. I love the fact that it makes your nails look great for two weeks. Thank You</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect pink! It is elegant, but still fun. Two coats and it&#x27;s so so so pretty.</li>
            <li> it is the perfect color. it is a pale pink with sparkles and will go with everything! i can&#x27;t wait to try out more colors!</li>
            <li> This is a little darker than I had thought...I was expecting something a little more sheer because I wanted to use it for a french manicure.  But it was still a really nice color.  It has a nice shimmer to it too.  Gelish is the best gel product out there.  They have the most colors and it lasts the longest.  I&#x27;ve had all kinds of other gel products and they usually chip in 2 weeks.  Gelish has lasted me no less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great polish for my wife!</li>
            <li> The color in the picture is pretty accurate. The color is a soft pink with a slight shimmer, it&#x27;s very subtle and pretty. I would recommend this polish to any pink lovers like myself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty pale pink. It has more sparkles to it than I generally like.</li>
            <li> the perfect pink, the sparkle is just a hint and not anything too loud.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect non-flashy light pink.  Some sparkle, not to much, and some transparency.  I really like it because of it&#x27;s delicate, elegant, sweet pink color.  I bought it at Sally Beauty Supply--way over priced.</li>
            <li> You have to apply about three coats to get the desired opacity of the polish. It&#x27;s a nice pink shimmery color but its not my kind of pink. I guess I expected it to be a more lighter pink shade but not too sheer. But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Quality not that great product seems watered down</li>
            <li> Perfect feminine girly color...  I used 3 coats and it&#x27;s so pale pink with the shimmery fine glitter ... such an awesome nail color...  perfect on it&#x27;s own and would also make an awesome nail bed color for French...</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, sparkly, and pretty pink!</li>
            <li> This gel polish is a very pretty lighter pink with a slight sheen to it. I did not expect the silver shimmer undertone from the picture but really like it anyways!</li>
            <li> This color makes my fingers look younger. The color is not very pronounced, but it looks elegant, sophisticated and mature. Well recommended.</li>
            <li> For some reason this particular color shrinks away from the edges after uv treating.  Don&#x27;t know if its an old bottle or this particular color. Other colors have not done this.</li>
            <li> This is a pale, petal pink color with a hint of a shimmer. Very neutral color, nice for work or dressing up. It could go either way. It doesn&#x27;t fade (unlike my experience with colors Go Girl and You&#x27;re So Sweet You&#x27;re giving Me A Toothache) I would recommend this color</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and I have done a good job on my nails.  If I can do it, anyone can.</li>
            <li> Very pretty glittery pink color.  Darker than it appears to be on the screen, but I was still happy with the color.</li>
            <li> Perfect soft pink tone with a touch of shimmer. very casual. I just wished it stayed on longer than one week</li>
            <li> Great color very neutral with a hint of pink and sparkle.  Wears modestly, perfect for the professional work environment. Adds interest to the french manicure.  I would definintely recommend this color for the discrete types.</li>
            <li> Very nice color ...not tooo pink at all . Very shimmering but not big glitter !! Very sweet and simple ...matches everything and amost a skin tone color .</li>
            <li> This color/brand combination require multiple coats to look decent. It just doesn&#x27;t compare to other gel polishes that I have used.</li>
            <li> I love this color! Its the perfect neutral pink with just a hint of shimmer. It goes on so easy and lasts for a while! I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails myself and Gelish has been the easiest in my opinion so far. Also, this is for the full size bottle which is awesome because its the same price at Sally&#x27;s but for the mini size. Great value!</li>
            <li> Soft pink, light shimmer. Two coats of top coat and it&#x27;s a barly there shimmer for french nails. Two coats of color (light elegant) instead and it&#x27;s a baby girl pink, shimmer is the same it&#x27;s just pinker, not bold, just simple. I like this color</li>
            <li> I simply love this color !  I prefer using only one thin coat for every day, whereby the color is clean and sheer yet nicely sparkly and fun.</li>
