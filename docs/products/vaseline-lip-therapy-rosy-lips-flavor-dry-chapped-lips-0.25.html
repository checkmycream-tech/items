    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>You are the best always</li>
            <li>My niece said the best she had ever found was Rosy Lips in Europe</li>
            <li>It truly is the best Lip Therapy!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect alternative to tinted lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>amazing stuff, fits in any bag!</li>
            <li>it was amazing!</li>
            <li>These smell good and are a great value.  </li>
            <li>I was in need of a truly good lip therapy.</li>
            <li>It even has a sweet fruity smell!!! üòç</li>
            <li>Great product, Vaseline is really the best.</li>
            <li>Very nice and more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Ahh I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Oh and the delivery was amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, I wish they made a perfume of this scent-  </li>
            <li>Nice product, but</li>
            <li>I like to keep my lip stick or balm in my pocket, and that is just too warm a place for this balm; it became liquefied</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip balm i have used.</li>
            <li>It is scented and if smelling roses is not your favorite, you might not like this one,</li>
            <li>Have tried so many things</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t getting any better</li>
            <li>This stuff feels more like Chapstick than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>I definitely love it.  </li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>is better and so affordable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gonna probably dump it and use the container for te original kind.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away, and I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>No. Hated it.</li>
            <li>Awesome lip moisturizer and conditioner that gives your lips the slightest hint of pink.  </li>
            <li>Upon reading great review, I try it out and within two application, her lips are rosy and healthy and the peeling skin between nose and upper lip starts fading away.</li>
            <li>I love this better than Kiehls lip balm, Fresh lip balm, Burts bees lip balm, etc.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>Amazon is my go-to place for anything rare and not too exotic.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than the normal vaseline and feels nice and smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li>I always use the original Vaseline on my lips</li>
            <li>This lip therapy works great, and it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li>But it does a great job of healing cracked or dry lips.</li>
            <li>Works great, keeps my lips from feeling dry.</li>
            <li>so I was super excited to see this mini version.</li>
            <li>Very sticky on lips, just OK</li>
            <li>Love the product, but it&#x27;s highly overpriced here!  </li>
            <li>Just as expected - love the rose tint</li>
            <li>I have owned so many lip balms (high end and drug store) and chapsticks and this</li>
            <li>Good size for purse, pocket, desk, or for children with dry hands or chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Helps hydrate and smooth my terribly dry lips, plus the light scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>I sort of wish I didn&#x27;t have to dip my finger in it to use it, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>good product as expected, thank you!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, sweet, subtle rosy smell, the color is light as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Really appreciate reviews!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Ordered in the morning, came back from work, they were already on the front porch, free shipping.</li>
            <li>Compared to Rosebud Salve this one is not as sticky, it&#x27;s much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention I love the rosy pink color it gives my lips.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm  </li>
            <li>The lip balm comes in an adorable little container that is just right for tucking into your purse.</li>
            <li>I normally use it at night before sleeping, it kept my lips all night moisturized, in the morning the lips would be super soft.</li>
            <li>As far as the tint goes, I honestly don&#x27;t detect it on my lips, even though in the little pot is looks very bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is thick and gooey with just a hint of rosy color, and it looks amazing on my lips.</li>
            <li>X 1¬Ω&amp;#34; X ¬Ω&amp;#34;, but a tiny bit goes a long way and it stays on the lips longer than most.</li>
            <li>My lips instantly felt refreshed and the slight rose smell helped clear up the winter blues.</li>
            <li>I am a complete lip balm addict.</li>
            <li>my lips are now soft and supple.</li>
            <li>The color is so nice, so natural; makes my tired, dry old lips look plump and moist.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to try this since I thought it would be like normal vaseline, but this lip therapy formula is much nicer.</li>
            <li>I would much rather deal with just a tiny bit of stickiness than the dry, scratchy lips I was dealing with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more subtle while moisturizing without drying out like other tinted lip glosses.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s much more subtle while moisturizing without drying out like other tinted lip glosses.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it makes my lips so soft and tender.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry lips and just a tiny bit lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I had to laugh at their size, being approximately 1¬Ω&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I also bite one specific spot due to anxiety</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry lips and around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Before this my lips were dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> They have been getting so dry they feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this Vaseline for lips and bought it hoping it would alleviate my desert dry lips.</li>
            <li> The only thing I felt should have been improved was the packaging, I can only use hand or cotton swab to apply, not very hygienic and waste a lot of product.</li>
            <li> It feels thick and luxurious on your lips, and gives a very natural rosy hue to them when applied.</li>
            <li> Other lip balms didn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for long.</li>
            <li> I mean, it is being applied directly under your nose!</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry lips due to allergies</li>
            <li> Guess not a total waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using the usual chapstick you can find easily at local stores</li>
            <li> No more dry lips</li>
            <li> My one comment which brought this down from a 5 star to a 4 star is that it is a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li> the hype about the color is a little overrated</li>
            <li> I have used every lip balm out there from crazy expensive to very cheap.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is so thick and makes my lips feel weird, there isn&#x27;t much color to it , and the smell isn&#x27;t something I  want on my lips.  </li>
            <li> the color is VERY subtle not really noticeable</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that both heals and prevents.</li>
            <li> It was hard to remove too.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and waxy and it doesn&#x27;t add color to lips.  </li>
            <li> This winter I have been having a terrible time with dry lips.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The size is waaaaay tooooo smaaaaaaaall. I didn&#x27;t expect this at all. It&#x27;s really tiny. On the other hand, it makes my lips so soft and tender.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen these before and decided to try them, after all it is Vaseline brand, which has been around for eons. I had to laugh at their size, being approximately 1¬Ω&amp;#34; X 1¬Ω&amp;#34; X ¬Ω&amp;#34;, but a tiny bit goes a long way and it stays on the lips longer than most. It is scented and if smelling roses is not your favorite, you might not like this one, I mean, it is being applied directly under your nose! As far as the tint goes, I honestly don&#x27;t detect it on my lips, even though in the little pot is looks very bright.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my needs.</li>
            <li> You are the best always</li>
            <li> Really works! My daughter has dry lips and around the mouth. Have tried so many things and it just wont do. Upon reading great review, I try it out and within two application, her lips are rosy and healthy and the peeling skin between nose and upper lip starts fading away. We finally found a product that works! Oh and the delivery was amazing. Ordered in the morning, came back from work, they were already on the front porch, free shipping. Thank you Amazon for the convenience and the reviewers!!! Really appreciate reviews!</li>
            <li> Just as expected - love the rose tint</li>
            <li> Very nice and more moisturizing</li>
            <li> No. Hated it. I always use the original Vaseline on my lips so I was super excited to see this mini version. But this rosy version does not compare at all! Now I have a bunch. Gonna probably dump it and use the container for te original kind. Guess not a total waste.</li>
            <li> Helps hydrate and smooth my terribly dry lips, plus the light scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> amazing stuff, fits in any bag!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I sort of wish I didn&#x27;t have to dip my finger in it to use it, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. It feels thick and luxurious on your lips, and gives a very natural rosy hue to them when applied. I bought the multi-pack so I could stash them everywhere!</li>
            <li> Very sticky on lips, just OK</li>
            <li> I am a complete lip balm addict. I always carry some and keep some at my desk. I was a little hesitant to try this since I thought it would be like normal vaseline, but this lip therapy formula is much nicer. It is thicker than the normal vaseline and feels nice and smooth on my lips. It smells great too. Compared to Rosebud Salve this one is not as sticky, it&#x27;s much smoother.  So far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> But it does a great job of healing cracked or dry lips.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm i have used. Before this my lips were dry and cracked. Other lip balms didn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for long. Since i started using the vaseline rosy lips my lips are now soft and supple. No more dry lips and it keeps my lips moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> good product as expected, thank you!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a truly good lip therapy. My niece said the best she had ever found was Rosy Lips in Europe and she could not find it in the states. Amazon is my go-to place for anything rare and not too exotic. Lo and behold there it was! It truly is the best Lip Therapy!</li>
            <li> Love it. Second time buying it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect alternative to tinted lip gloss. It&#x27;s much more subtle while moisturizing without drying out like other tinted lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I bought his product for a friend, at her request. She uses this, and only this, as lip moisturizer. She swears by this product and it gives her just the slightest bit of pinkish color to the lip. Plus, she should now have enough to last for a loooong time!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It even has a sweet fruity smell!!! üòç</li>
            <li> Oh my lanta! I was shopping at Walmart and had a coupon for another lip brand and product when something about this caught my eye. I have horribly dry lips due to allergies and I also bite one specific spot due to anxiety so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that both heals and prevents. The second I put this one it was amazing! My lips instantly felt refreshed and the slight rose smell helped clear up the winter blues. Not to mention I love the rosy pink color it gives my lips. I will be buying this product for every woman in my family.</li>
            <li> This winter I have been having a terrible time with dry lips. They have been getting so dry they feel like sandpaper. I have been using the usual chapstick you can find easily at local stores but it just wasn&#x27;t getting any better so I went searching for something else that may help. I stumbled across this Vaseline for lips and bought it hoping it would alleviate my desert dry lips. I have been very happy with my purchase. I bought the Rosy Lips version of the Vaseline Lip Therapy and it has been healing my lips. My one comment which brought this down from a 5 star to a 4 star is that it is a little bit sticky. I would much rather deal with just a tiny bit of stickiness than the dry, scratchy lips I was dealing with. Once I run out I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great product, Vaseline is really the best. Good size for purse, pocket, desk, or for children with dry hands or chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Came super fast! Perfect</li>
            <li> This stuff feels more like Chapstick than Vaseline.  It is thick and waxy and it doesn&#x27;t add color to lips.  I recommend buying the cocoa butter version.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this product since I already use regular Vaseline on my lips to keep them moist.  This came today and I tried it......all I can say is YUCK!!!  It is so thick and makes my lips feel weird, there isn&#x27;t much color to it , and the smell isn&#x27;t something I  want on my lips.  It was hard to remove too.  Guess you can&#x27;t believe everything you read, everybody is different, and the same product can feel different on you.</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps my lips from feeling dry. Stays on for a while</li>
            <li> Nice product, but the hype about the color is a little overrated the color is VERY subtle not really noticeable</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry lips and just a tiny bit lasts for quite a while.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome lip moisturizer and conditioner that gives your lips the slightest hint of pink.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, sweet, subtle rosy smell, the color is light as I wanted it to be. I normally use it at night before sleeping, it kept my lips all night moisturized, in the morning the lips would be super soft. I definitely love it.  The only thing I felt should have been improved was the packaging, I can only use hand or cotton swab to apply, not very hygienic and waste a lot of product.</li>
            <li> The lip balm arrived on time, and well packaged.  I started using it right away, and I love this stuff!  It is thick and gooey with just a hint of rosy color, and it looks amazing on my lips. My lips feel protected, and hydrated.  The color is so nice, so natural; makes my tired, dry old lips look plump and moist.  I really like this lip balm  Thank you, Vaseline!  The lip balm comes in an adorable little container that is just right for tucking into your purse. I like to keep my lip stick or balm in my pocket, and that is just too warm a place for this balm; it became liquefied so I will have to keep it in my purse instead.  I will recommend this to my friends, and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I have used every lip balm out there from crazy expensive to very cheap.  These smell good and are a great value.  It is the only thing that keeps my lips moisturized.  I buy the 4 pack and leave them everywhere- car, office, home.  I love this better than Kiehls lip balm, Fresh lip balm, Burts bees lip balm, etc.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Ahh I love this stuff! It smells amazing, I wish they made a perfume of this scent-  I would so buy it. This lip therapy works great, and it lasts a long time too. I have owned so many lip balms (high end and drug store) and chapsticks and this is better and so affordable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it&#x27;s highly overpriced here!  It&#x27;s under $2.00 at the store!</li>
