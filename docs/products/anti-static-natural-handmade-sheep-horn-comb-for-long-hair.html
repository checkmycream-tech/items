            <li>Many thanks for giving me such a good comb.</li>
            <li>The combs arrived early and I love them.</li>
            <li>They do not have that static cling that most other combs have.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more of a female than man thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This comb is very sturdy and well-made.</li>

            <li>, it is much better quality although more expensive.</li>
            <li>The sheep horn comb is quiet large, bigger than I expected, but it&#x27;s a good quality comb.</li>
            <li>this comb is soft on your scalp and gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li>There are some small crack in the comb, I thought it does not matter and want to keep it, but as time past (1-2 week), the crack becomes more and more clear.  </li>
            <li>The comb appears to be super solid and will last for years.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to get used to it because it feels so natural to me.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised nor alarmed when it happened to this comb.</li>
            <li>but I have a shofar which is made of natural horn that has the identical smell</li>
            <li>so it is definitely natural sheep</li>
            <li>I ordered several natural combs.</li>
            <li>It is smoothly carved with no snags and thick and weighty</li>
            <li>The tines are very smooth, so it is unlikely to snag.</li>

            <li> I did use it when my hair was wet and moisturized,</li>

            <li> This comb is super nice!! I have some wood combs but I still have to get used to them. I love this comb, its strong and I don&#x27;t need to get used to it because it feels so natural to me. I almost want to buy 50 just so I will always have them lol. I&#x27;m going to see how long it lasts before I buy another one for traveling. Fingers crossed that this is the comb I will always love and continue to always use!! I have extra wide plastic ones when using when my hair is wet. Then I use this one after I have moisturizer in my hair after it&#x27;s dry. I did use it when my hair was wet and moisturized, just to see, I love it!!! I&#x27;m planning on growing my hair until it can&#x27;t grow anymore, I guess my terminal length(I&#x27;m hoping tailbone). So this comb is going to be my staple if all goes well!!</li>
            <li> This comb is very sturdy and well-made. The tines are very smooth, so it is unlikely to snag. Like some others I notice a &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34; smell, but it IS made from sheep horn after all. I expect the smell to dissipate eventually. Not a deal-breaker. It&#x27;s a beautiful comb and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully distributes oils applied to my hair.  And if you are finicky with static making your hair fly this will resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> I love how sturdy this comb is and the comfortable length of the handle.  My only issue with this comb was that at the very beginning when this comb got wet (from me combing my wet hair) it smelled like wet animal.  However, that went away within a couple of days. I&#x27;ve had that temporary issue with another bone comb so I wasn&#x27;t surprised nor alarmed when it happened to this comb.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. It goes through my hair so nicely and has a nice quality, durability to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered several natural combs. This one was the best by far. I have rather strong and tangly hair. This comb glides through easiest and is easier to grip. The quality is great. The silk carrying case is really good if you need that sort of thing which I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s more of a female than man thing in my opinion. The comb appears to be super solid and will last for years. Unlike rubber, I don&#x27;t think the teeth will ever bend, distort or break. It is really made of horn. When it first arrives, it has the natural smell of a sheep horn which is not pleasant but I have a shofar which is made of natural horn that has the identical smell so it is definitely natural sheep horn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have literally ordered half a dozen of these combs to keep in various places so that I always have a comb handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super pleased.</li>
            <li> There are some small crack in the comb, I thought it does not matter and want to keep it, but as time past (1-2 week), the crack becomes more and more clear.  So do not throw away packaging material as soon as you received the item and it seems ok. I bought a horn comb in Tan&#x27;s brand, it is much better quality although more expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the comb, it is just as advertised!</li>
            <li> The sheep horn comb is quiet large, bigger than I expected, but it&#x27;s a good quality comb. I love it.</li>
            <li> this comb is soft on your scalp and gentle on hair.  my sister and I love it.  teeth are fat and round so it doesn&#x27;t part well need another like rat tail comb for parting.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried to buy combs from so far away without a lot of information on the product. But for the price I decided to try. The combs arrived early and I love them. I received two light coloured combs. They seem to be of excellent quality. They really stop the static electricity and do not damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Nice easy to use quality comb, I used it myself and its pretty gentle but bought it for to use for my cottony coated dogs. (Have not tried it on them yet.)  Well made, seems sturdy and my husband loved the feel of it on his fine thinning hair and scalp.  He was disappointed I bought it for the dogs!</li>
            <li> So, I just realized what the description meant.  I thought the name meant it looked like sheep&#x27;s horn not that it IS sheep&#x27;s horn!  Unless im incorrect on that, I feel sad if it&#x27;s true.  In any case, I love this comb.  Only using on dry hair.  It is an odd shape and I had doubts it would make it through my long, medium thick hair.  Totally does a great job.</li>
            <li> hese combs are of good quality and look nice too.  They do not have that static cling that most other combs have.  They are great.</li>
            <li> The comb itself is very nice. It is smoothly carved with no snags and thick and weighty so it seems it will be sturdy and unlikely to break. My only complaint that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the word Oriental is deeply carved on one side. The opposite side was shown in the picture and I would have preferred an unmarked comb. The translucency is lovey and the carrying pouch is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love it. Wonderful comb:) Beautiful package with good quality. I will buy more. Many thanks for giving me such a good comb.</li>
            <li> The delivery is fast.  The comb is well-packaged.  I can tell the difference  after I  use this comb  for a while.  It  helps blood circulation of my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.  I have not detected any smell mentioned by some others.  Nice color.  I wish the teeth section was a bit larger, and a larger handle would also suit me, but I knew this before I ordered it..</li>
