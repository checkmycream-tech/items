            <li>I love it in my swim bag - one product instead of shampoo and shower gel.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful - relaxing, peaceful, yet invigorating, and I never fail to get compliments.  </li>
            <li>My friends will love the fragrance,too.&lt;br /&gt;Easily recommend this product to ladies who like feminine fragrances.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and most Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>This is my Mother&#x27;s favorite body wash of ALL time</li>
            <li>I love philosophy products and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li>Love using these products a lot.</li>
            <li>Love Philosophy shower gel.  </li>
            <li>The shower gel can be used as bubble bath, shampoo, and gel - so very useful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich, classic scent and a great way to honor her memory.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, which is like Amazing Grace and Pure Grace but has a hint of lavender.</li>
            <li>They are so clean, freash, and lovely to wear.  </li>
            <li>I Love Inner Grace, this is my favorite out of all that Philosophy has!!</li>
            <li>Best fragrance from Philosophy hands down.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous shower gel...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I had never used philosophy products before, &amp; with this 3 option luxurious gel it is rich in lather &amp; my skin</li>
            <li>This is an incredibly rich bath gel that is a lifesaver in the dryness that is Colorado air.  </li>
            <li>The best are from my mom, who has always been critical of my fragrance choices, and my 7 year old, who always tells me I \\&quot;smell beautiful\\&quot; when I wear it!</li>
            <li>You end up smelling clean instead of perfumed when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy&#x27;s Inner Grace is the most amazing scent that they have come up with.</li>
            <li>She is very picky in fragrance choices and this scent has been all time favorite for years.</li>
            <li>inner grace is a very elegant smell.</li>
            <li>She love the clean smell with the soft floral or almost musky scent that follows.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent and the soft feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and left my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and apparently philosophy is no longer making it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Amazing Grace for several years but because of the price I&#x27;m only able to purchase it once a year.  </li>
            <li>Just a clean, classic smell.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more charity products from philosophy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s romantic, sophisticated, and understated.</li>
            <li>I smelled it and it was the first thing that came to mind.  </li>
            <li>These are two additional bottles-loved the first order so much.</li>
            <li>Luckily she has stocked but she may have to use Pure or Amazing Grace when she runs out :-/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very light, with undertones of lavender and a nice vaguely soapy smell.  </li>
            <li>My observation is that the fragrance of the shower gel does not linger after the shower anyway, so that really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>There are other philosophy fragrances I like better, but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li>Most people in the U.S. are crazy over amazing grace, but I&#x27;ve found that AG is a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Got Inner Grace as part of a daily special value promotion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>pure grace is my all-time favorite scent from philosphy, and inner grace follows closely behind.  </li>
            <li>But beware that the Philosophy products may have changed when the company changed hands, though the new owners claim to be using the same formulas.</li>
            <li>I had other items on here though and was trying to bump up the purchase amount to get free shipping (again, tight budget) and gambled that I would like this.  </li>

            <li> Inner Grace is a pleasing product that emits a delicate fragrance while you are showering, but the fragrance does not appear to last after the shower.</li>
            <li> I took one whiff of this delicate lavender powder soft floral scent &amp; was hooked.</li>
            <li> My mother used this product &amp; I found it one day &amp; was curious as to what it smelled like.</li>
            <li> THAT I BOUGHT THE TRAVEL KIT, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES A SMALL BOTTLE OF PARFUME.</li>
            <li> The liquid is thick and creamy, and it lasts for almost a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever try it as a shampoo, I&#x27;m a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> so I could return it since I&#x27;m now stuck with an expensive bottle of shower gel</li>
            <li> No matter what scents you like, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy!  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> My mother has &amp; said it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> Inner Grace is a pleasing product that emits a delicate fragrance while you are showering, but the fragrance does not appear to last after the shower. There are other philosophy fragrances I like better, but that is just my opinion.

But beware that the Philosophy products may have changed when the company changed hands, though the new owners claim to be using the same formulas.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE 1ST PHILOSOPHY PRODUCT THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. I BOUGHT IT ON THE CHANCE THAT I MIGHT LIKE IT. IT IS A GREAT SPRING/SUMMER SENT. I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I BOUGHT THE TRAVEL KIT, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES A SMALL BOTTLE OF PARFUME. I HAVE GOTTEN ALOT OF COMPLEMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT.</li>
            <li> My mother used this product &amp; I found it one day &amp; was curious as to what it smelled like. I took one whiff of this delicate lavender powder soft floral scent &amp; was hooked. I had never used philosophy products before, &amp; with this 3 option luxurious gel it is rich in lather &amp; my skin never feels dry.

            <li> I adored Dana Reeve and this product makes me think of her every time I use it.  It&#x27;s a rich, classic scent and a great way to honor her memory.</li>
            <li> pure grace is my all-time favorite scent from philosphy, and inner grace follows closely behind.  Most people in the U.S. are crazy over amazing grace, but I&#x27;ve found that AG is a little too strong for me.  inner grace is a very elegant smell.

            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly rich bath gel that is a lifesaver in the dryness that is Colorado air.  The scent is really nice as well.

            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s Inner Grace is the most amazing scent that they have come up with. It&#x27;s romantic, sophisticated, and understated.</li>
            <li> Got Inner Grace as part of a daily special value promotion. Love the scent, which is like Amazing Grace and Pure Grace but has a hint of lavender. To me it subtler than Baby Grace, but then fragrances smell different to all of us and on all of us. I&#x27;m hoping Christina will soon be offering the combo shower gel in the 32 oz. size.</li>
            <li> I puchased this product easpecially in memory of Dana Reeve, but it is a wonderful product.  I use it as a bath gel, and my skin has never felt better, and as a shampoo, it&#x27;s great.  I love it in my swim bag - one product instead of shampoo and shower gel.

            <li> I bought this as a gift and I was tempted to keep it myself.  It smell heavenly!  Not overpowering either, just light and wonderful.  I definitely recommend it.</li>

            <li> My very favorite fragrance. So glad I was able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and apparently philosophy is no longer making it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li> Best fragrance from Philosophy hands down.  This is a fabulous shower gel...just make sure you have one of those &amp;#34;thingees&amp;#34; to get the best lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot understand why Philosophy is fazing out Inner Grace.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The light scent is light and delightful. The liquid is thick and creamy, and it lasts for almost a year.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and most Philosophy products. Arrived in good shape and has a very pleasant clean scent. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is great for a relaxing shower or bath before bed and I love the scent and the soft feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Love Inner Grace, this is my favorite out of all that Philosophy has!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells. not too OLDISH and I feel great. I love Philosophy products! I always wear &amp;#34;Falling In Love&amp;#34; perfume! This body wash leaves a nice clean smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amazing Grace for several years but because of the price I&#x27;m only able to purchase it once a year.  This year I decided to try another scent and after reading reviews from here and other sites decided to try Inner Grace.  I debated buying it through Nordstrom since the price is the same but includes free shipping and returns if you&#x27;re not happy with it.  I had other items on here though and was trying to bump up the purchase amount to get free shipping (again, tight budget) and gambled that I would like this.  Sadly the reviews saying the scent is &amp;#34;old lady-ish&amp;#34; are true.  I smelled it and it was the first thing that came to mind.  I&#x27;m now regretting that I didn&#x27;t get it from Nordstrom so I could return it since I&#x27;m now stuck with an expensive bottle of shower gel I&#x27;ll never use.  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> This is my Mother&#x27;s favorite body wash of ALL time and unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued! She is very picky in fragrance choices and this scent has been all time favorite for years. She love the clean smell with the soft floral or almost musky scent that follows. Luckily she has stocked but she may have to use Pure or Amazing Grace when she runs out :-/</li>
            <li> I love philosophy products and have used them for many years.I bought this one as a gift for my sister inlaw.</li>
            <li> It was everything that it was described as. Pleasant smell and left my skin soft. Love using these products a lot.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy shower gel.  Makes my skin feel so silky smooth.</li>
