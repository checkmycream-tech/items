            <li> The only thing I would say is it doesn&#x27;t last long for me</li>
            <li> so I felt defeated and had no idea how I was going to accept just rocking the grey hair when I don&#x27;t look like I should have greys (don&#x27;t hate, lol).</li>
            <li> I have dark brown black hair and about a year ago became very allergic to hair dye!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown/black hair naturally.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden a few months ago I developed a reaction to my regular hair dye that had my scalp feeling like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> Too bad as I liked the non amm</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Works well if you do not have any grey hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist length, naturally black hair probably about 60% or more gray, not sure because I&#x27; keep it colored.  </li>
            <li> i only used this because i HAD to due to an allergic reaction to something</li>
            <li> Note in the picture: my roots are untouched, and the blonde is slightly orange.</li>
            <li> so I proceeded to color my hair a few weeks later.  </li>
            <li> I am not ready to acclimate that into my life at the moment</li>
            <li> Absolutely no gray coverage.  </li>
            <li> For the price you payfor one pack you can buy 3 in other places  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely allergic to PPD and other products that are supposed to be in hair colors to replace PPD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Or using conventional dye.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will do in the long run.  </li>
            <li> from the other hair colors and don&#x27;t want to mess with the henna - indigo</li>
            <li> It does not weight the hair down either.  </li>
            <li> I use the Black.</li>
            <li> Not even a subtle tint of red.</li>
            <li> if you have stubborn gray hair you have to keep it in for one and a half hour.</li>
            <li> is a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I found this product after searching for something I could use without all the harsh chemicals and found Cosamo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sad that it does not last at all</li>
            <li> Lately the color is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> so the color stays for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> No more emergency room visits trying to find a product that won&#x27;t end in disaster!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the horror stories of some people experiencing worse</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I have a terrible allergy to PPD.  </li>
            <li> It had the slightest blue/purple tinge, but it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but oh my goodness, his hair went through a very awkward lavender stage as the color faded/washed out.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing since I can&#x27;t use a dye with dpe.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My dad is allergic to a lot of hair dyes.. This product works great for him... He absolutely loves it..</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  It does not damaged the hair even when someone swim regularly. It does not weight the hair down either.  It&#x27;s a bit sad that it does not last at all, one should apply it very often to cover the gray hair.</li>
            <li> i only used this because i HAD to due to an allergic reaction to something but i dont know what to yet.&lt;br /&gt;my hair felt no different than it does after a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;and it covered everything, is a nice color, not the flat color i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;no peroxide, ammonia, ppd or any derivitives of it.&lt;br /&gt;no mixing of anything either.&lt;br /&gt;so much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;yes it will have to be done more often than permanent but its so easy without mixing etc.  comes in a bottle, just put it on and wait.  says 20-40 depending on your hair. so i waited 30.  perfect.</li>
            <li> Make certain that you do the patch test first.  Like other reviewers, I have a terrible allergy to PPD.  I did two patch tests several days apart:  one on inner elbow, the second on the hairline at the back of my head.  I wanted to make certain that I could use this product and not need a trip to the ER.  Both tests came out fine so I proceeded to color my hair a few weeks later.  (I was just really nervous).  The color worked perfectly.  I am so happy with how it covered my very stubborn grey hair.  I only wish it would last longer.  (Hey Cosamo, work on a permanent color solution for those of us with allergies)!  Try it- you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Feels great to color my haair and have no rashes itching any of those horribe after effects</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am so glad my research led me to this. All of a sudden a few months ago I developed a reaction to my regular hair dye that had my scalp feeling like it was on fire. I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching to the point I was causing scabs!! I&#x27;ve read all the horror stories of some people experiencing worse so I knew I needed to find an alternative and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 yrs old and experiencing grey hair. I am not ready to acclimate that into my life at the moment so I felt defeated and had no idea how I was going to accept just rocking the grey hair when I don&#x27;t look like I should have greys (don&#x27;t hate, lol). The only thing I would say is it doesn&#x27;t last long for me and I have to color my hair more often but I&#x27;ll take that!! I just placed an order for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> My husband had to darken his salt and pepper hair to look younger for a community theater role.  I suggested he use something non-permanent to avoid the stark roots after the role was over and after striking out at the local stores, we decided to give this a try. .  This effectively darkened his gray hair and looked very natural; it didn&#x27;t at all create the &amp;#34;you must have just dyed your hair&amp;#34; reaction.  It did not turn his mostly-white hair stark black, but more of a darker gray.  The costume director said he looked younger, so mission accomplished.  It had the slightest blue/purple tinge, but it wasn&#x27;t bad -- I was perfectly happy to be seen with my hubby in public.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for full gray coverage, but I think it would work well if you had just a few grays to cover or if you were looking for a temporary fix.  So far it has held up well through several shampoos.  Not sure how it will do in the long run.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My hubby used this to cover his gray hair for a role in a play.  It worked find and looked pretty natural -- but oh my goodness, his hair went through a very awkward lavender stage as the color faded/washed out.  Just be prepared.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t not color my hair at all. Absolutely no gray coverage.  I followed the directions but got no results.  I want to find a hair color that will cover the gray but not cause allergic reaction.  This caused no reaction but no coverage either.  Still on quest for a safe hair color, so for now still showing roots.</li>
            <li> For the price you payfor one pack you can buy 3 in other places  is a waste of money</li>
            <li> Lately the color is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;? It has a blue/purple effect. I use the Black. It lasts until regrowth for me and covers 90% of my gray. NO issues with allergies like most of the other color does for me. I&#x27;ve quit using it now after several years because of this new &amp;#34;Blue/Purple&amp;#34; issue and will perhaps try a different color? Loved it up until a few months ago - formula change maybe?</li>
            <li> First time use was absolutely great, on the second time use within 2 weeks no luck. I will try again to see if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely allergic to PPD and other products that are supposed to be in hair colors to replace PPD&#x27;s. My ears and any skin that the coloring touches on my neck will turn red and swollen and my scalp will get blistery. I have thick, waist length, naturally black hair probably about 60% or more gray, not sure because I&#x27; keep it colored.  I&#x27;ve been searching for and trying all different products.  I&#x27;ve tried hennas and dislike the reddish tint that happens as the color fades. This is the first product that has worked wonderfully for me.  I use 1 1/2 bottles and can get very satisfactory color but my hair is coarse and absorbs color easily.. I put the plastic cap on, wrap a towel around my head to add some heat to the development and keep it on for about 1 hour. It fully covers most of the gray and blends the rest. I like this type of coverage because it looks very natural. I wash my hair with color protecting shampoo and conditioner about 2 or 3  times a week so the color stays for at least 3 weeks. The area at my temple washes out quicker but I actually like the graying temple effect. My hair grows very fast so I will show some roots but it still looks blended.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. I did not use heat, it might work better if you do, but there were alternate instructions provided for those who don&#x27;t wish to use heat, and I followed them precisely, with the exception of letting the color sit for a full hour because after trying to use the same brand (in black) and seeing my hair get a shade darker instead of black, I thought perhaps more time would be better. My hair was lightened a month ago, and the directions say that results may not be as desired on lightened hair. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. When my hair came out orange, I had only myself to blame. That isn&#x27;t the reason for my 1 star review. My roots picked up NO color. Not even a subtle tint of red. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. You&#x27;re better off getting natural henna (no additives!) Or using conventional dye. This is a complete waste of time and money. Note in the picture: my roots are untouched, and the blonde is slightly orange. This really doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Works well if you do not have any grey hair. I have a sprinkle of grey at the roots and left product in for full 40 minutes and the grey turned dark brown while rest of my hair went black. I have dark brown/black hair naturally. Too bad as I liked the non amm. and peroxide free features advertised.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown black hair and about a year ago became very allergic to hair dye! I would have a burning itchy scalp and a rash for weeks! I found this product after searching for something I could use without all the harsh chemicals and found Cosamo. I love it to cover my gray hairs that are starting to show. No reaction!!!!!!! Saved my life!!!!!!! Yes you have to use more often but that is better than a allergic reaction!!!</li>
            <li> Its great no reaction but doesn&#x27;t really cover gray .</li>
            <li> This works for me since I have no other color options for dying my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover really stubborn grey or silver hair around my temples.  However,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the color boost it provides all over.  If you are sensitive and get&lt;br /&gt;rashes from the other hair colors and don&#x27;t want to mess with the henna - indigo&lt;br /&gt;route, this will work.  Stock up on it, you will need to refresh often.</li>
            <li> product is very mild to the hair. if you have stubborn gray hair you have to keep it in for one and a half hour.</li>
            <li> If you react to hair dye- please do a test patch before using.</li>
            <li> I have now tried this product 3 times. The first time I did exactly what it said to do and I got about 30% of my gray covered. The second time I left it in for 45 minutes, again like it said if you have stubborn gray, and with the same results. Not wanting to give up I tried it a third time and left it in for 2 hours!!! Maybe 40% gray coverage from that. Every time it washes completely away one the very first shampoo. Very disappointing since I can&#x27;t use a dye with dpe.</li>
            <li> Color only stayed true for one shampooing, but this is very gentle, nice black color, looks natural, covers gray well, and with the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; Allergies I have , this was a dream come true! No more emergency room visits trying to find a product that won&#x27;t end in disaster!  I suggest buying more than one at a time to touch up when needed, so far it has lasted me 3 weeks with some fading.</li>
