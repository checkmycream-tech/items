            <li>I really love that treatment.</li>
            <li>Your hair is more manageable and look fuller.</li>
            <li>I just need some more time to make sure of that.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful and makes my hair ultra soft!</li>
            <li>I love both,these are the best,I love the smell,and make my hair really smooth.</li>
            <li>OGX shampoo is worth it for sure</li>

            <li>The only thing, and I am not sure it is related to the shampoo, I am seeing a bit more dandruff than before.</li>
            <li>I had chemotherapy following a diagnosis of breast cancer and so far this is strengthening my hair.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t shine as much as it did with my previous shampoo/conditioner.</li>

            <li> Makes my hair feel silky</li>
            <li> I really love that treatment. you do feel a difference right after your bath. Your hair is more manageable and look fuller. The only thing, and I am not sure it is related to the shampoo, I am seeing a bit more dandruff than before. I always had dandruff on and off... I just need some more time to make sure of that.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair feel like if it&#x27;s dirty, and it made my scalp break it with pimples.  Gross.</li>
            <li> Seems to help boost hair a bit. Great scent!</li>
            <li> I see that some people are stating that the conditioner isn&#x27;t working it&#x27;s magic and isn&#x27;t moisturizing; I love the smell and it sounds complicated but I use the OGX shampoo WITH the Dove 5x moisture conditioner and I have VEEERY frustrating hair (dead ends from dying my hair) and it is collarbone length, the two products add softness and moisture while having a ton of volume, I use a quarter of the shampoo and a nickel size of the conditioner, the two scents are amazing together! OGX shampoo is worth it for sure</li>
            <li> Really works well. I had chemotherapy following a diagnosis of breast cancer and so far this is strengthening my hair. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Shampoo dries out my hair and the conditioner does not moisturize.</li>
            <li> This product really did make my hair look more full, but I didn&#x27;t like that it made my hair feel dry. I used the coconut one before this and it was great! Up don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this version again, but I will buy the OGX products again.</li>
            <li> nice my hair grow fast and beautiful</li>
