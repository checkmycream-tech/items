            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>The whitening results of these strips are remarkable.</li>
            <li>The people deliverying it are very kind and good to work with.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I used whitening toothpaste along with an electric toothbrush for what I thought was good results.  </li>
            <li>good quality for the price, just didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped.</li>
            <li>fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked good for me.</li>
            <li>the change in my teeth wasnot good</li>
            <li>However, for the cost, these work good.</li>
            <li>I tried these strips about two weeks before family portraits and was very pleased with how they brightened my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips for years, and was always very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>It was way better ordering these than buying them in a store (and I work in a Target with a discount!)</li>
            <li>I love my whitestrips!</li>
            <li>I got it expcting amazing results</li>
            <li>You know how they say the birth control pill could be 99% effective if used correctly, but in actuallity, it&#x27;s 80% effective because people don&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>Honestly, the product works.  </li>
            <li>I always recommend consulting your dentist if you have any questions or want to make sure it&#x27;s a good product for you</li>
            <li>I had an upcoming vacation that I wanted to look nice for.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll do them a favor and get the surface all nice and clean.\\</li>
            <li>I proceeded with Day 3 (today) and to no one&#x27;s blame but my own.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely effective and won&#x27;t cause sensitivity issues if that&#x27;s something youre concerned with.</li>
            <li>I have taken Ibupropin, as suggested in the web searches I did to see what I could do for relief and gargled with warm salt water.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT IS NICE TO USE ONCE IN A WHILE .THAT</li>
            <li>These, I just don&#x27;t think are as effective.</li>
            <li>and so I bought this kind to remove any unwanted smoking stains.</li>
            <li>So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product highly rated by consumers report.  </li>
            <li>I have a big smile which is one of my best attributes, but now my best attribute comes with spots all over them.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The strips stick to themselves very easily and you won&#x27;t get them undone (like plastic wrap sticking to itself)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve heard a lot better reviews for Crests</li>
            <li>like the idea of being able to whiten your teeth on your own time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of Crest White Strips before and have always seen great results and experienced no pain...</li>
            <li>plus for 10 dollars more i could have gotten the ones that start showing effects in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to master the art of placing these on your teeth.</li>
            <li>and I was really pleased with it...</li>
            <li>If you need more whitening, I would suggest a longer kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they were just okay for me, nothing like the results you&#x27;ll get from a dentist.  </li>
            <li>Still, I guess they are better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I just stick them in and close my mouth -- top teeth touching bottom teeth-- breathing through my nose and trying to stem off the salivation it provokes (in me).</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made the change from whitening trays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and I will be buying this product again soon.</li>
            <li>The solution tends to burn, but otherwise, it does the job, for the most part.</li>
            <li>It could be better as for the whitening part.</li>
            <li>; I have been continuously using these strips, and I must say, they hurt my teeth more than I thought</li>
            <li>More effective products need to be made available to us</li>
            <li>If the strips were longer, they&#x27;d cover more teeth to the sides of the front ones.</li>
            <li>, a dentist visit might be better for that person.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that \\&quot;famous</li>
            <li>I am glad the strips didn&#x27;t fall off</li>
            <li>I like crest products but they were not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Works better when used with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Turns out, they didn&#x27;t have any pain issues at all with these.  :)</li>
            <li>I used these like the instructions state and made sure I followed the schedule to a T.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s mostly where my problems come from, coffee....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any resultsthat would cause me to buy this prosuct any more.  </li>
            <li>If I would have known that I would&#x27;ve paid $10 more for the level 5.</li>
            <li>Works OK</li>
            <li>i am fully satisfied with purchases.</li>
            <li>:-):-):-)</li>
            <li>When I have my regular check-ups, both my dentist and the hygienist are always impressed with the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are now free of my coffee stains and I have a boost in confidence!</li>
            <li>I paid 30 dollars for the at rite aid and they are good but even after the first use my teeth were so sore.</li>
            <li>Crest has done a pretty good job of making the peroxide stay on the strip in gel form as you peel it off but any slip while putting on the strips and the gel will wipe on whatever it touches.  </li>
            <li>These are definitely cheap, easy, and work!</li>
            <li>whitening agent is quite strong, and when I got on my lips accidently it stung until I was able to rinse the area off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and worth it!!</li>
            <li>so I should be able to make an accurate comparison.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, they fit well</li>
            <li>Definitely a more economical option than trays from the dentist!</li>
            <li>But appreciate that Crest gives a full refund!</li>
            <li>They slip off too easily and don&#x27;t whiten that well.  </li>
            <li>Love the results and outcome for such a great price.</li>
            <li>The strips are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They changed something because these strips easily slide off my teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and a lot cheaper than treatments offered at dental offices</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE NO PROBLEM</li>
            <li>better off spending money for the more powerful crest strips.....</li>
            <li>They were easy to put on and did not cause any pain (the up and up target brand did).</li>
            <li>If you want whiter teeth, good old fashioned baking soda could do a better job than this stuff.</li>
            <li>they are fine for the price</li>
            <li>They stick fine</li>
            <li>These strips stayed on my teeth just fine if I gave them the 30 minutes of focus</li>
            <li>I first tried them in high school as every girl wants to look her best..</li>
            <li>so I caught the sheet of strips, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li>For the occasional whitening, the 10-count box is great, though.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap plus it works.</li>
            <li>My thoughts, this is a great starting product with quicker results than brushing alone.</li>
            <li>DONT BUY THEM... buy ones with the advanced seal on them.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my teeth whitened and my dentist just took my braces off.</li>
            <li>and I did well with putting the strips on and keeping them secure on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>I do this every couple of years to boost the smile :)</li>
            <li>I didnt realize the huge difference that these do NOT have the advanced seal technology.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s good for complete coverage of the teeth</li>
            <li>It really whitens your teeth!!!</li>
            <li>I like it because the strips are easy to use and you can see quick results.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve got that figured out, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li>The original product came with a 14 day supply, 24 sets of strips.  </li>
            <li>the whitestrips from Crest so-so, not nearly that great of a result.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely significant.</li>
            <li>I use these once a month to keep my original whitening in check</li>
            <li>Put the top one on first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work fine, but I would really recommend just investing in a custom tray and some gel.</li>
            <li>I actually find using baking soda and the crest toothpaste more effective.</li>
            <li>The Advanced Vivid strips are shaped to more easily adhere to your teeth</li>
            <li>I will say after using them for several weeks, they definitely are successful in whitening the teeth and making them look overall a lot more healthy and attractive.</li>
            <li>The top strips stayed on very nicely, but sometimes the bottom strips slipped a little.</li>
            <li>I was so excited since I used similar strips years ago and had had good results.  </li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star is because I&#x27;m assuming had I used the more strong strips, the results would have been even better.  </li>
            <li>not do the job, and they&#x27;re cheaper than getting special treatments at the dentists</li>
            <li>However it only whitened them for about a week or so, I take care of my teeth, however if you want visibly whiter teeth for a good 2 months your going to need the 2-hour ones.</li>
            <li>Overall, i think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>This got results much faster, so I didn&#x27;t need to do as many applications to get the whiteness I wanted.</li>
            <li>I used a better form of this before, so I guess I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li>We go through a lot financially and time-wise trying to find a good product to use.</li>
            <li>I would suggest just spending a bit more and getting one of the kits that will REALLY impress you.</li>
            <li>but it seems the only good results are going to be from going in somewhere and getting a treatment done.</li>
            <li>Therefore, my top teeth definitely had more of a whiter appearance than my bottom ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my go-to use for a quick whitening.</li>
            <li>will purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like having a bright white smile....</li>
            <li>They are super portable, thinner than a credit card, which means you can take them with you to work, on trips, or to use in the car.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it wasn&#x27;t permanent, but then again, neither was the whitening.</li>
            <li>Perhaps te high end stuff works better</li>
            <li>I have always been very pleased with crest white strips.</li>
            <li>My bottom set is not as straight, so the strip didn&#x27;t stick easily there.  </li>
            <li>The strips were easy to apply and weren&#x27;t too much of an annoyance while in use.</li>
            <li>I wasted my money and I wanted a beautiful smile for when I started school.</li>
            <li>Crest White Strips are among my favorite cosmetic products!  </li>
            <li>My top set of teeth is level and flat, so the strips stuck to them easily.  </li>
            <li>However, some on here have had success.</li>
            <li>well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d almost be worth the price if it stopped here</li>
            <li>I am probably more sensitive than most,&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li>actor\\&quot; kind of white teeth</li>
            <li>I do have some teeth that are more sensitive</li>
            <li>to this day they are my best kept secret.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>But, it goes away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for three consecutive days right before....</li>
            <li>and just didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>I use them once a year, normally right before school starts and ALWAYS get compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Beauty is pain right?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect a product like this to be a replacement for a whitening trip to the dentist, but it&#x27;s not a bad in between (if you can stand how they feel), especially if you&#x27;re one who isn&#x27;t able to see the dentist every 6 months.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how yellow they had become until I have started seeing in recent years, more and more people walking around with dazzling white teeth....</li>
            <li>Save yourself the money, and buy the better version of these strips, with less pain and better results.</li>
            <li>I consistently receive compliments on my smile.  </li>
            <li>Why not just brush your teeth with a good natural paste a few times more per day?</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter and white enough for me to be happy with them.  </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive teeth like me, you will probably also want to have some Motrin available too.</li>
            <li>but when I compare it to the Advanced Vivid</li>
            <li>While they stayed in place better than other strips, they still didn&#x27;t stay put securely.</li>
            <li>These Crest Vivid Whitestrips are an improvement over the older ones, in that they stay on your teeth better and seem to do a better job of whitening in a lesser amount of time.  </li>
            <li>(Crest recommends doing top and bottom separately), and you have to be disciplined enough to take about 10 minutes of your day out to use them.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think I&#x27;d have more luck with whitening toothpaste or a one-stop visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say they do, whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>These work well, but not the first time you use one.</li>
            <li>when I signed up to review the Crest 3D Whitestrips which require that I stick these things on my teeth every day for ten days, as you can imagine, it became more like 10 weeks.  </li>
            <li>As far as pain/sensitivity goes, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve embarrassed myself for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all when amazon sent me this they didn&#x27;t even send it to me in a box they sent it to me in a bag.</li>
            <li>;) &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>People that whiten their teeth regularly may not see the results that much, but for those that are just now starting off - this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>But after trying the Crest 3D strips, the results were even more noticeable in only a week.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these strips</li>
            <li>the only thing is it makes you speak like u have spit in your mouth... but its ok, and i started to see the difference after two uses...</li>
            <li>First thing first</li>
            <li>Brightened my teeth in the first couple days</li>
            <li>Cheaper than in stores, this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says</li>
            <li>Firstly, they slip off of my teeth because the saliva builds up under the tray.</li>
            <li>These strips work, but it takes more than one box, and several treatments before you see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li>Good for a quick whitening when teeth become dingy and dull.  </li>
            <li>I actually took a picture of my teeth before I started the regimen just to be able to document for myself if, and how much change there was.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER it&#x27;s such a cheap thing to try and do yourself that it&#x27;s worth the attempt.  </li>
            <li>and I most likely will not use the whole box...</li>
            <li>It kind of hurt at the beginning when you apply it to your teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to get just a little more out of it.    </li>
            <li>As long as you stick to the guidelines for use you should be okay</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d hurt yourself more holding carbonated water on your tongue for too long.</li>
            <li>good product - have used in the past - couldn&#x27;t buy in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>The Advanced Vivid strips adhered to my teeth better, so I never had to taste the gross whitening goop, and they seemed to whiten a little better.</li>
            <li>I love these whitening strips and I am pleased with the results although it is clear that I will need to use them about every 6 months for the extra white look.</li>
            <li>I realize a movement from one shade of white to another is almost undetectable but \\&quot;visible whitening\\&quot;, as the advertising claims, should be easy to spot.  </li>
            <li>They stay on my teeth and don&#x27;t slide around and are easy to apply to both upper and lower teeth</li>
            <li>Easy and simply to use</li>
            <li>I will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get the Advanced Vivid which stay in place.</li>
            <li>It also is pretty important that you have somewhat flat teeth.  </li>
            <li>I think I would&#x27;ve liked them to turn out a little whiter, but vivid is the most basic type for Crest</li>
            <li>it ain&#x27;t fancy, it ain&#x27;t pretty, and it ain&#x27;t high tech...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if they will do a good job but have high hopes that they will.</li>
            <li>and they really do work.</li>
            <li>I was very impress withe the outcome.</li>
            <li>If the sensitivity is too much, stop the strips.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect too much though, otherwise you might fret.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-reviewed on here and seems to augment the effect VERY well.</li>
            <li>but it really irritates the gums.  </li>
            <li>You have to use the whole box to notice any difference if at all.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the results.  </li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth all that much either.</li>
            <li>do not stay on your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Or you could just use a very dilute hydrogen peroxide solution as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>wish they werent so much money</li>
            <li>Contrary to everything I read about how much the strips stick -- often too much --</li>
            <li>Thanks alot (sarcasm)</li>
            <li>They work but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Really was looking forward to seeing the results</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the product really did work like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>As to their whitening power, I don&#x27;t feel I can really attest because I use them too infrequently.</li>
            <li>after one week I was amazed at how much whiter my teeth really were...</li>
            <li>Each time i use these it really does take stains away.  </li>
            <li>I dont drink much coffee</li>
            <li>These work but don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I have used the more expensive Professional Crest Whitening Strips and loved them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically if you want to test how good these will stay on your teeth, just cut out two, tiny strips of plastic wrap and try putting those on and keeping them on for half an hour</li>
            <li>I would recommend it though, just get the higher levels if you want to clearly see a change.</li>
            <li>Therefore my recommendation is to try this first and if you don&#x27;t get the results you wanted then go ahead and ask your dentist about a professional whitening.</li>
            <li>There was just too much variance from one picture to the next to be able to come up with an objective before-and-after picture.  </li>
            <li>In spite of my current redneck residence, I was blessed with a full set of teeth and no overbite.  </li>
            <li>Also, even if the strips would remain on my teeth for the 20 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to keep them on there, they don&#x27;t cover the full row of upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I used peroxide gel that I purchased online with teeth trays and my teeth whitened really nicely.</li>
            <li>However, you might want to try the more expensive version shown on the chart that stays in place better and is stronger.</li>
            <li>Indeed, these appear the same strips that began the Crest White Strip line many years ago.  </li>
            <li>They apply decently.</li>
            <li>The two biggest payoffs are that they&#x27;re actually brighter, even at similar hues to what they were before, if that makes sense, and also, that the staining (or lack thereof) gets so much more even-looking.</li>
            <li>The only ones to order are the advanced seal professional effects.  </li>
            <li>have had some tooth sensitivity, particularly on my lower front teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s one of the main ingredients in these strips)</li>
            <li>Decently priced as well.</li>
            <li>It would probably take 4 of these boxes to even come close to a decent result...</li>
            <li>since quit the coffee but still need a better solution for getting my teeth back to white again.</li>
            <li>or I was particularly uncoordinated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say this is the kind of product you would buy if you want some brief whitening (such as say, before a wedding or other special occasion).</li>
            <li>Its worth the extra cash to get the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips that do not move around and stick to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the high end product from crest.  </li>
            <li>did not find any highly noticeable change to my teeth color,</li>
            <li>Although they cannot compare to professional tooth whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, they are a smart product to use in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li>I noticed a little bit aftera couple days, and halfway through am already pleased.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but since i got the vivid, it was the least whitening, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Crest White Strips Vivid 3D worked only ok for me......</li>
            <li>I started using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>At one point, I had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office, and I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between those results and the Crest</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that many users of these strips tend to have trouble getting these to stick to their bottom teeth</li>
            <li>I had the most trouble getting the dang envelope</li>
            <li>I was able to keep the upperstrip on for almost 30 minutes, but the lower strip falls off within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re so much better than messy trays.</li>
            <li>in mind, though, that brilliantly white teeth result from good genes (in a very, very few people) or veneers.</li>
            <li>There are \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; options that are purported to provide more dramatic results</li>
            <li>There are \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; options that are purported to provide more dramatic results</li>
            <li>Furthermore, if you recently completed a longer period with the White Strips, these might good for a \\&quot;touch up,\\&quot; several months later.    </li>
            <li>Using a standard color chart I was able to see that after ten days my teeth were two shades whiter, more than that they had less of a yellow &#x27;tinge&#x27;.      </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of whitening that will last a couple of months, these will work nicely.  </li>
            <li>The strips seemed kind of old or worn and it was hard to keep them attached to teeth as well.</li>
            <li>They are large enough to cover all visible areas and your teeth will stay whiter for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I cannot go more than several applications without causing extreme sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Since I have a top and bottom set of teeth, I could simply use the strips on one set and leave the other set as-is.  </li>
            <li>Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li>Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li>the Vivid strips will whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>First off I want to say I&#x27;ve been using whitestrips for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li>my teeth stay pretty white.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I normally use the crest professional ones and I got these because they were cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, I was also nervous about sensitivity; I didn&#x27;t know where my own gums would be on the pain scale, possibly having to space these out to every other day.     </li>
            <li>The fact that you really have to mean it to do your own tooth whitening, or simply pay a professional to do</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re honestly hard to notice if you have them pressed on gently to stick, and they remove easily.    </li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d get the Vivid on sale and get a clear idea of how the system all works.</li>
            <li>The white strips arrived so quickly and I have white teeth now!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were fine, dissolved and were not as messy afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are not horribly stained but my teeth are not really white, so I wanted to use this product to get them a little lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other teeth whitening products at home and, like this one, they always make my teeth hurt afterwards, but I was taken aback by how quickly this one gets noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I bought them at a local store for a much lower price so probably won&#x27;t be ordering them from Amazon unless I can&#x27;t find them in the stores near my home anymore.</li>
            <li>but if you go over the amount of time or use them too frequently you can experience sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I keep them on for the instructed time and when I take them off my teeth ache and continue to ache the whole next day.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything heavy-hitting -- for one, it would set off alarms with people that saw me frequently.</li>
            <li>Go to the dentist and pay the money for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It is quite obnoxious but I really want my teeth to be white for my wedding</li>
            <li>I do have relatively sensitive teeth, so that may have been part of the problem.</li>
            <li>These are the old fashioned whitening strips which do not adhere to your teeth so consequently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 5 of 20 treatments that came in the Professional Effects box.  </li>
            <li>They worked and did not make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>but people didn&#x27;t really notice how white my teeth were until I started oil pulling.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal though.</li>
            <li>(there are professional effects, etc.).</li>
            <li>But that might make too much sense, and not give a massive multinational congomerate the profits they need to pay their exectuive bonuses this Xmas.</li>
            <li>word of caution for people with sensitive teeth-</li>
            <li>was surprised that my gums were tingling for some hours after I removed the strips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Buy the Professional Effects type instead.</li>
            <li>, and I use to be a dental assistant, and used professional grade products with trays from the office, this works twice as well for me.</li>
            <li>They slide off a lot easier than the professional ones</li>
            <li>can with the crest professional ones.</li>
            <li>I have been asked since I was 15 yrs old</li>
            <li>: this makes sensitive teeth more sensitve, is kind of weird to use, and is inferior to simple daily personal dental hygiene using non-artificial chemical means.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay on too good, not impressed with them at all.</li>
            <li>The limited whitening they do (while visibly a bit better) is not worth the pain and suffering you endure.</li>
            <li>I have used Crest Whitestrips in the past, but I think I must have bought the Advanced Vivid, which stayed in place.</li>
            <li>These whiten decently, but the strength is low.</li>
            <li>I used some Crest White strips a few months ago which were the Advanced Vivid strips</li>
            <li>they were in open, I always seemed to tear it either to high</li>
            <li>I used to see results after just a couple of days with the old product...a whole box of these little monsters did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dramatic changes in tooth color, subtle at best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, and most importantly, they&#x27;re IMPOSSIBLE to handle.</li>
            <li>I am not saying you won&#x27;t get any results, but since they slip off quickly there is little &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; time.</li>
            <li>I really like how it whitened my teeth in such a short amount of time, however, it hurt my teeth a lot.</li>
            <li>wait till I&#x27;ve gone through the whole next day seeing it in different lights (bathroom mirror with incandescent, car mirror with sunlight, work mirror with fluorescent, etc.)</li>
            <li>This is much more expensive than whitening toothpaste treatments, but the results occur much faster.  </li>
            <li>and I actually keep my mouth slightly open the whole time they&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a major overhaul, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you; but if you&#x27;re just looking to spruce your teeth up a bit, it will get the job done.</li>
            <li>My teeth were not very dark</li>
            <li>I did not notice the different &amp;#34;grades&amp;#34; of white strips when I ordered these, but the Vivid&#x27;s don&#x27;t whiten like the Professional Effects.  </li>
            <li>there are more expensive options, but these help a decent amount without spending $200</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D White White strips Vivid are a new entry level product in the Crest White Strip teeth whitening line.    </li>
            <li>The only problem is if you have sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>I must admit though I have throttled back my use because they do make my teeth extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback I experiences is that my teeth became relatively sensitive after using the strips so expect a bit of discomfort even if you take care of your teeth religiously.</li>
            <li>I saw results as early as the 3rd day.</li>
            <li>My back teeth are sensitive and</li>
            <li>The only thing that I dislike about it, and this has nothing to do with the seller, but after three months of applying them, I already can tell that my teeth are returning back to normal color.</li>
            <li>Alas, more spots.  </li>
            <li>guess what I&#x27;m saying is that these are clinically proven to work if you use as directed and cheaper than other whitening treatments, but be ready for the effort.</li>
            <li>They leave little mini strips in your mouth which are sticky, You can barely get the strips on in the first place..</li>
            <li>So far I have only used two days of the treatments and my teeth are noticeably white.</li>
            <li>The bottom absolutely is useless and the top is hit or miss as far as staying on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because my 50 year old teeth, drenched in coffee everyday, really needed a bit of help.  </li>
            <li>After trying this for several days, my upper teeth became extremely sensitive and I have asked the supplier to let me return the remaining portion.  </li>
            <li>For the average person, who wants to save money, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>well if they would stay firmly planted on the teeth, but because they slip completely off the teeth or up to the gums, I have to highly recommend not spending the money on this product.</li>
            <li>I did experience some sensitivity after using them, especially the first few times.</li>
            <li>They are constantly sliding all over my mouth and will not stay in the same position for more than about five seconds unless I firmly keep my jaw clenched, which is quite uncomfortable to do for more than a few minutes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The whitening results of these strips are remarkable.</li>
            <li> The people deliverying it are very kind and good to work with.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I used whitening toothpaste along with an electric toothbrush for what I thought was good results.  </li>
            <li> good quality for the price, just didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped.</li>
            <li> fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked good for me.</li>
            <li> the change in my teeth wasnot good</li>
            <li> However, for the cost, these work good.</li>
            <li> I tried these strips about two weeks before family portraits and was very pleased with how they brightened my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips for years, and was always very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> It was way better ordering these than buying them in a store (and I work in a Target with a discount!)</li>
            <li> I love my whitestrips!</li>
            <li> I got it expcting amazing results</li>
            <li> You know how they say the birth control pill could be 99% effective if used correctly, but in actuallity, it&#x27;s 80% effective because people don&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Honestly, the product works.  </li>
            <li> I always recommend consulting your dentist if you have any questions or want to make sure it&#x27;s a good product for you</li>
            <li> I had an upcoming vacation that I wanted to look nice for.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll do them a favor and get the surface all nice and clean.\\</li>
            <li> I proceeded with Day 3 (today) and to no one&#x27;s blame but my own.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely effective and won&#x27;t cause sensitivity issues if that&#x27;s something youre concerned with.</li>
            <li> I have taken Ibupropin, as suggested in the web searches I did to see what I could do for relief and gargled with warm salt water.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT IS NICE TO USE ONCE IN A WHILE .THAT</li>
            <li> These, I just don&#x27;t think are as effective.</li>
            <li> and so I bought this kind to remove any unwanted smoking stains.</li>
            <li> So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product highly rated by consumers report.  </li>
            <li> I have a big smile which is one of my best attributes, but now my best attribute comes with spots all over them.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The strips stick to themselves very easily and you won&#x27;t get them undone (like plastic wrap sticking to itself)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve heard a lot better reviews for Crests</li>
            <li> like the idea of being able to whiten your teeth on your own time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of Crest White Strips before and have always seen great results and experienced no pain...</li>
            <li> plus for 10 dollars more i could have gotten the ones that start showing effects in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to master the art of placing these on your teeth.</li>
            <li> and I was really pleased with it...</li>
            <li> If you need more whitening, I would suggest a longer kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall they were just okay for me, nothing like the results you&#x27;ll get from a dentist.  </li>
            <li> Still, I guess they are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I just stick them in and close my mouth -- top teeth touching bottom teeth-- breathing through my nose and trying to stem off the salivation it provokes (in me).</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made the change from whitening trays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and I will be buying this product again soon.</li>
            <li> The solution tends to burn, but otherwise, it does the job, for the most part.</li>
            <li> It could be better as for the whitening part.</li>
            <li> ; I have been continuously using these strips, and I must say, they hurt my teeth more than I thought</li>
            <li> More effective products need to be made available to us</li>
            <li> If the strips were longer, they&#x27;d cover more teeth to the sides of the front ones.</li>
            <li> , a dentist visit might be better for that person.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that \\&quot;famous</li>
            <li> I am glad the strips didn&#x27;t fall off</li>
            <li> I like crest products but they were not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Works better when used with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Turns out, they didn&#x27;t have any pain issues at all with these.  :)</li>
            <li> I used these like the instructions state and made sure I followed the schedule to a T.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s mostly where my problems come from, coffee....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any resultsthat would cause me to buy this prosuct any more.  </li>
            <li> If I would have known that I would&#x27;ve paid $10 more for the level 5.</li>
            <li> Works OK</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases.</li>
            <li> :-):-):-)</li>
            <li> When I have my regular check-ups, both my dentist and the hygienist are always impressed with the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are now free of my coffee stains and I have a boost in confidence!</li>
            <li> I paid 30 dollars for the at rite aid and they are good but even after the first use my teeth were so sore.</li>
            <li> Crest has done a pretty good job of making the peroxide stay on the strip in gel form as you peel it off but any slip while putting on the strips and the gel will wipe on whatever it touches.  </li>
            <li> These are definitely cheap, easy, and work!</li>
            <li> whitening agent is quite strong, and when I got on my lips accidently it stung until I was able to rinse the area off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and worth it!!</li>
            <li> so I should be able to make an accurate comparison.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, they fit well</li>
            <li> Definitely a more economical option than trays from the dentist!</li>
            <li> But appreciate that Crest gives a full refund!</li>
            <li> They slip off too easily and don&#x27;t whiten that well.  </li>
            <li> Love the results and outcome for such a great price.</li>
            <li> The strips are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They changed something because these strips easily slide off my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a lot cheaper than treatments offered at dental offices</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE NO PROBLEM</li>
            <li> better off spending money for the more powerful crest strips.....</li>
            <li> They were easy to put on and did not cause any pain (the up and up target brand did).</li>
            <li> If you want whiter teeth, good old fashioned baking soda could do a better job than this stuff.</li>
            <li> they are fine for the price</li>
            <li> They stick fine</li>
            <li> These strips stayed on my teeth just fine if I gave them the 30 minutes of focus</li>
            <li> I first tried them in high school as every girl wants to look her best..</li>
            <li> so I caught the sheet of strips, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li> For the occasional whitening, the 10-count box is great, though.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap plus it works.</li>
            <li> My thoughts, this is a great starting product with quicker results than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THEM... buy ones with the advanced seal on them.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my teeth whitened and my dentist just took my braces off.</li>
            <li> and I did well with putting the strips on and keeping them secure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> I do this every couple of years to boost the smile :)</li>
            <li> I didnt realize the huge difference that these do NOT have the advanced seal technology.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s good for complete coverage of the teeth</li>
            <li> It really whitens your teeth!!!</li>
            <li> I like it because the strips are easy to use and you can see quick results.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got that figured out, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li> The original product came with a 14 day supply, 24 sets of strips.  </li>
            <li> the whitestrips from Crest so-so, not nearly that great of a result.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely significant.</li>
            <li> I use these once a month to keep my original whitening in check</li>
            <li> Put the top one on first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they work fine, but I would really recommend just investing in a custom tray and some gel.</li>
            <li> I actually find using baking soda and the crest toothpaste more effective.</li>
            <li> The Advanced Vivid strips are shaped to more easily adhere to your teeth</li>
            <li> I will say after using them for several weeks, they definitely are successful in whitening the teeth and making them look overall a lot more healthy and attractive.</li>
            <li> The top strips stayed on very nicely, but sometimes the bottom strips slipped a little.</li>
            <li> I was so excited since I used similar strips years ago and had had good results.  </li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star is because I&#x27;m assuming had I used the more strong strips, the results would have been even better.  </li>
            <li> not do the job, and they&#x27;re cheaper than getting special treatments at the dentists</li>
            <li> However it only whitened them for about a week or so, I take care of my teeth, however if you want visibly whiter teeth for a good 2 months your going to need the 2-hour ones.</li>
            <li> Overall, i think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> This got results much faster, so I didn&#x27;t need to do as many applications to get the whiteness I wanted.</li>
            <li> I used a better form of this before, so I guess I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li> We go through a lot financially and time-wise trying to find a good product to use.</li>
            <li> I would suggest just spending a bit more and getting one of the kits that will REALLY impress you.</li>
            <li> but it seems the only good results are going to be from going in somewhere and getting a treatment done.</li>
            <li> Therefore, my top teeth definitely had more of a whiter appearance than my bottom ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my go-to use for a quick whitening.</li>
            <li> will purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like having a bright white smile....</li>
            <li> They are super portable, thinner than a credit card, which means you can take them with you to work, on trips, or to use in the car.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it wasn&#x27;t permanent, but then again, neither was the whitening.</li>
            <li> Perhaps te high end stuff works better</li>
            <li> I have always been very pleased with crest white strips.</li>
            <li> My bottom set is not as straight, so the strip didn&#x27;t stick easily there.  </li>
            <li> The strips were easy to apply and weren&#x27;t too much of an annoyance while in use.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and I wanted a beautiful smile for when I started school.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips are among my favorite cosmetic products!  </li>
            <li> My top set of teeth is level and flat, so the strips stuck to them easily.  </li>
            <li> However, some on here have had success.</li>
            <li> well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d almost be worth the price if it stopped here</li>
            <li> I am probably more sensitive than most,&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li> actor\\&quot; kind of white teeth</li>
            <li> I do have some teeth that are more sensitive</li>
            <li> to this day they are my best kept secret.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> But, it goes away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for three consecutive days right before....</li>
            <li> and just didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I use them once a year, normally right before school starts and ALWAYS get compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Beauty is pain right?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a product like this to be a replacement for a whitening trip to the dentist, but it&#x27;s not a bad in between (if you can stand how they feel), especially if you&#x27;re one who isn&#x27;t able to see the dentist every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how yellow they had become until I have started seeing in recent years, more and more people walking around with dazzling white teeth....</li>
            <li> Save yourself the money, and buy the better version of these strips, with less pain and better results.</li>
            <li> I consistently receive compliments on my smile.  </li>
            <li> Why not just brush your teeth with a good natural paste a few times more per day?</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter and white enough for me to be happy with them.  </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive teeth like me, you will probably also want to have some Motrin available too.</li>
            <li> but when I compare it to the Advanced Vivid</li>
            <li> While they stayed in place better than other strips, they still didn&#x27;t stay put securely.</li>
            <li> These Crest Vivid Whitestrips are an improvement over the older ones, in that they stay on your teeth better and seem to do a better job of whitening in a lesser amount of time.  </li>
            <li> (Crest recommends doing top and bottom separately), and you have to be disciplined enough to take about 10 minutes of your day out to use them.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think I&#x27;d have more luck with whitening toothpaste or a one-stop visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they say they do, whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> These work well, but not the first time you use one.</li>
            <li> when I signed up to review the Crest 3D Whitestrips which require that I stick these things on my teeth every day for ten days, as you can imagine, it became more like 10 weeks.  </li>
            <li> As far as pain/sensitivity goes, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve embarrassed myself for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all when amazon sent me this they didn&#x27;t even send it to me in a box they sent it to me in a bag.</li>
            <li> ;) &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> People that whiten their teeth regularly may not see the results that much, but for those that are just now starting off - this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> But after trying the Crest 3D strips, the results were even more noticeable in only a week.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these strips</li>
            <li> the only thing is it makes you speak like u have spit in your mouth... but its ok, and i started to see the difference after two uses...</li>
            <li> First thing first</li>
            <li> Brightened my teeth in the first couple days</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in stores, this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says</li>
            <li> Firstly, they slip off of my teeth because the saliva builds up under the tray.</li>
            <li> These strips work, but it takes more than one box, and several treatments before you see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick whitening when teeth become dingy and dull.  </li>
            <li> I actually took a picture of my teeth before I started the regimen just to be able to document for myself if, and how much change there was.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER it&#x27;s such a cheap thing to try and do yourself that it&#x27;s worth the attempt.  </li>
            <li> and I most likely will not use the whole box...</li>
            <li> It kind of hurt at the beginning when you apply it to your teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to get just a little more out of it.    </li>
            <li> As long as you stick to the guidelines for use you should be okay</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d hurt yourself more holding carbonated water on your tongue for too long.</li>
            <li> good product - have used in the past - couldn&#x27;t buy in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The Advanced Vivid strips adhered to my teeth better, so I never had to taste the gross whitening goop, and they seemed to whiten a little better.</li>
            <li> I love these whitening strips and I am pleased with the results although it is clear that I will need to use them about every 6 months for the extra white look.</li>
            <li> I realize a movement from one shade of white to another is almost undetectable but \\&quot;visible whitening\\&quot;, as the advertising claims, should be easy to spot.  </li>
            <li> They stay on my teeth and don&#x27;t slide around and are easy to apply to both upper and lower teeth</li>
            <li> Easy and simply to use</li>
            <li> I will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get the Advanced Vivid which stay in place.</li>
            <li> It also is pretty important that you have somewhat flat teeth.  </li>
            <li> I think I would&#x27;ve liked them to turn out a little whiter, but vivid is the most basic type for Crest</li>
            <li> it ain&#x27;t fancy, it ain&#x27;t pretty, and it ain&#x27;t high tech...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if they will do a good job but have high hopes that they will.</li>
            <li> and they really do work.</li>
            <li> I was very impress withe the outcome.</li>
            <li> If the sensitivity is too much, stop the strips.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect too much though, otherwise you might fret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-reviewed on here and seems to augment the effect VERY well.</li>
            <li> but it really irritates the gums.  </li>
            <li> You have to use the whole box to notice any difference if at all.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for the results.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth all that much either.</li>
            <li> do not stay on your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Or you could just use a very dilute hydrogen peroxide solution as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> wish they werent so much money</li>
            <li> Contrary to everything I read about how much the strips stick -- often too much --</li>
            <li> Thanks alot (sarcasm)</li>
            <li> They work but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Really was looking forward to seeing the results</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the product really did work like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> As to their whitening power, I don&#x27;t feel I can really attest because I use them too infrequently.</li>
            <li> after one week I was amazed at how much whiter my teeth really were...</li>
            <li> Each time i use these it really does take stains away.  </li>
            <li> I dont drink much coffee</li>
            <li> These work but don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I have used the more expensive Professional Crest Whitening Strips and loved them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically if you want to test how good these will stay on your teeth, just cut out two, tiny strips of plastic wrap and try putting those on and keeping them on for half an hour</li>
            <li> I would recommend it though, just get the higher levels if you want to clearly see a change.</li>
            <li> Therefore my recommendation is to try this first and if you don&#x27;t get the results you wanted then go ahead and ask your dentist about a professional whitening.</li>
            <li> There was just too much variance from one picture to the next to be able to come up with an objective before-and-after picture.  </li>
            <li> In spite of my current redneck residence, I was blessed with a full set of teeth and no overbite.  </li>
            <li> Also, even if the strips would remain on my teeth for the 20 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to keep them on there, they don&#x27;t cover the full row of upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I used peroxide gel that I purchased online with teeth trays and my teeth whitened really nicely.</li>
            <li> However, you might want to try the more expensive version shown on the chart that stays in place better and is stronger.</li>
            <li> Indeed, these appear the same strips that began the Crest White Strip line many years ago.  </li>
            <li> They apply decently.</li>
            <li> The two biggest payoffs are that they&#x27;re actually brighter, even at similar hues to what they were before, if that makes sense, and also, that the staining (or lack thereof) gets so much more even-looking.</li>
            <li> The only ones to order are the advanced seal professional effects.  </li>
            <li> have had some tooth sensitivity, particularly on my lower front teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s one of the main ingredients in these strips)</li>
            <li> Decently priced as well.</li>
            <li> It would probably take 4 of these boxes to even come close to a decent result...</li>
            <li> since quit the coffee but still need a better solution for getting my teeth back to white again.</li>
            <li> or I was particularly uncoordinated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say this is the kind of product you would buy if you want some brief whitening (such as say, before a wedding or other special occasion).</li>
            <li> Its worth the extra cash to get the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips that do not move around and stick to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the high end product from crest.  </li>
            <li> did not find any highly noticeable change to my teeth color,</li>
            <li> Although they cannot compare to professional tooth whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, they are a smart product to use in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit aftera couple days, and halfway through am already pleased.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but since i got the vivid, it was the least whitening, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips Vivid 3D worked only ok for me......</li>
            <li> I started using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that really seemed to help.</li>
            <li> At one point, I had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office, and I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between those results and the Crest</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that many users of these strips tend to have trouble getting these to stick to their bottom teeth</li>
            <li> I had the most trouble getting the dang envelope</li>
            <li> I was able to keep the upperstrip on for almost 30 minutes, but the lower strip falls off within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re so much better than messy trays.</li>
            <li> in mind, though, that brilliantly white teeth result from good genes (in a very, very few people) or veneers.</li>
            <li> There are \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; options that are purported to provide more dramatic results</li>
            <li> There are \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; options that are purported to provide more dramatic results</li>
            <li> Furthermore, if you recently completed a longer period with the White Strips, these might good for a \\&quot;touch up,\\&quot; several months later.    </li>
            <li> Using a standard color chart I was able to see that after ten days my teeth were two shades whiter, more than that they had less of a yellow &#x27;tinge&#x27;.      </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of whitening that will last a couple of months, these will work nicely.  </li>
            <li> The strips seemed kind of old or worn and it was hard to keep them attached to teeth as well.</li>
            <li> They are large enough to cover all visible areas and your teeth will stay whiter for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I cannot go more than several applications without causing extreme sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Since I have a top and bottom set of teeth, I could simply use the strips on one set and leave the other set as-is.  </li>
            <li> Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> the Vivid strips will whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> First off I want to say I&#x27;ve been using whitestrips for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li> my teeth stay pretty white.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I normally use the crest professional ones and I got these because they were cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I was also nervous about sensitivity; I didn&#x27;t know where my own gums would be on the pain scale, possibly having to space these out to every other day.     </li>
            <li> The fact that you really have to mean it to do your own tooth whitening, or simply pay a professional to do</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re honestly hard to notice if you have them pressed on gently to stick, and they remove easily.    </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d get the Vivid on sale and get a clear idea of how the system all works.</li>
            <li> The white strips arrived so quickly and I have white teeth now!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were fine, dissolved and were not as messy afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are not horribly stained but my teeth are not really white, so I wanted to use this product to get them a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other teeth whitening products at home and, like this one, they always make my teeth hurt afterwards, but I was taken aback by how quickly this one gets noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I bought them at a local store for a much lower price so probably won&#x27;t be ordering them from Amazon unless I can&#x27;t find them in the stores near my home anymore.</li>
            <li> but if you go over the amount of time or use them too frequently you can experience sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I keep them on for the instructed time and when I take them off my teeth ache and continue to ache the whole next day.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything heavy-hitting -- for one, it would set off alarms with people that saw me frequently.</li>
            <li> Go to the dentist and pay the money for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It is quite obnoxious but I really want my teeth to be white for my wedding</li>
            <li> I do have relatively sensitive teeth, so that may have been part of the problem.</li>
            <li> These are the old fashioned whitening strips which do not adhere to your teeth so consequently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 of 20 treatments that came in the Professional Effects box.  </li>
            <li> They worked and did not make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> but people didn&#x27;t really notice how white my teeth were until I started oil pulling.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal though.</li>
            <li> (there are professional effects, etc.).</li>
            <li> But that might make too much sense, and not give a massive multinational congomerate the profits they need to pay their exectuive bonuses this Xmas.</li>
            <li> word of caution for people with sensitive teeth-</li>
            <li> was surprised that my gums were tingling for some hours after I removed the strips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Buy the Professional Effects type instead.</li>
            <li> , and I use to be a dental assistant, and used professional grade products with trays from the office, this works twice as well for me.</li>
            <li> They slide off a lot easier than the professional ones</li>
            <li> can with the crest professional ones.</li>
            <li> I have been asked since I was 15 yrs old</li>
            <li> : this makes sensitive teeth more sensitve, is kind of weird to use, and is inferior to simple daily personal dental hygiene using non-artificial chemical means.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on too good, not impressed with them at all.</li>
            <li> The limited whitening they do (while visibly a bit better) is not worth the pain and suffering you endure.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips in the past, but I think I must have bought the Advanced Vivid, which stayed in place.</li>
            <li> These whiten decently, but the strength is low.</li>
            <li> I used some Crest White strips a few months ago which were the Advanced Vivid strips</li>
            <li> they were in open, I always seemed to tear it either to high</li>
            <li> I used to see results after just a couple of days with the old product...a whole box of these little monsters did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dramatic changes in tooth color, subtle at best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, and most importantly, they&#x27;re IMPOSSIBLE to handle.</li>
            <li> I am not saying you won&#x27;t get any results, but since they slip off quickly there is little &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; time.</li>
            <li> I really like how it whitened my teeth in such a short amount of time, however, it hurt my teeth a lot.</li>
            <li> wait till I&#x27;ve gone through the whole next day seeing it in different lights (bathroom mirror with incandescent, car mirror with sunlight, work mirror with fluorescent, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is much more expensive than whitening toothpaste treatments, but the results occur much faster.  </li>
            <li> and I actually keep my mouth slightly open the whole time they&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a major overhaul, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you; but if you&#x27;re just looking to spruce your teeth up a bit, it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not very dark</li>
            <li> I did not notice the different &amp;#34;grades&amp;#34; of white strips when I ordered these, but the Vivid&#x27;s don&#x27;t whiten like the Professional Effects.  </li>
            <li> there are more expensive options, but these help a decent amount without spending $200</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White White strips Vivid are a new entry level product in the Crest White Strip teeth whitening line.    </li>
            <li> The only problem is if you have sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I must admit though I have throttled back my use because they do make my teeth extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback I experiences is that my teeth became relatively sensitive after using the strips so expect a bit of discomfort even if you take care of your teeth religiously.</li>
            <li> I saw results as early as the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> My back teeth are sensitive and</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dislike about it, and this has nothing to do with the seller, but after three months of applying them, I already can tell that my teeth are returning back to normal color.</li>
            <li> Alas, more spots.  </li>
            <li> guess what I&#x27;m saying is that these are clinically proven to work if you use as directed and cheaper than other whitening treatments, but be ready for the effort.</li>
            <li> They leave little mini strips in your mouth which are sticky, You can barely get the strips on in the first place..</li>
            <li> So far I have only used two days of the treatments and my teeth are noticeably white.</li>
            <li> The bottom absolutely is useless and the top is hit or miss as far as staying on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because my 50 year old teeth, drenched in coffee everyday, really needed a bit of help.  </li>
            <li> After trying this for several days, my upper teeth became extremely sensitive and I have asked the supplier to let me return the remaining portion.  </li>
            <li> For the average person, who wants to save money, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> well if they would stay firmly planted on the teeth, but because they slip completely off the teeth or up to the gums, I have to highly recommend not spending the money on this product.</li>
            <li> I did experience some sensitivity after using them, especially the first few times.</li>
            <li> They are constantly sliding all over my mouth and will not stay in the same position for more than about five seconds unless I firmly keep my jaw clenched, which is quite uncomfortable to do for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> But they will do at least some good for people who have coffee/cigarette stains, etc., so trying them first isn&#x27;t a bad idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is that they just don&#x27;t whiten nearly as much as they should, yes I got a little bit whiter from using them but not nearly what they should be.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but it did not stay white as long as they claimed it to be.</li>
            <li> The TV and print ads market these types of items as simple and easy to use yet this item was sticky, difficult to adjust correctly on the teeth</li>
            <li> The color of teeth varies naturally from very white to almost black;  bleaching can only slightly change your natural color.</li>
            <li> It took 5 strips just to whiten my teeth one shade and it made my teeth so sensitive I didn&#x27;t even want to eat anything for 12 hours on average after using them for just 5 days</li>
            <li> The tooth sensitivity doesn&#x27;t last long, just a day or so, and after four applications spaced over two weeks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that problem, probably because they don&#x27;t stay in place long enough to cause any pain!</li>
            <li> whitestrip comes in a flat foil package and contains two strips, one for the uppers and another for the lowers.  </li>
            <li> so I tried them again--expecting the same results with minor discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Yes, but the various trade-offs (and rip-off price for a tiny bit of plastic plus cheap chemicals) add up to not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot get these to stick to my teeth - they slide around and come off completely after only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I will say with my particular case (VERY little soda caffeine, no coffee or tea or alcohol)</li>
            <li> On my 3rd day i had a big headache due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I felt a tingle for a few minutes, but it was enough to remember the days of pouring peroxide on my cuts and not nearly enough to resemble actual pain.</li>
            <li> It seems to be that the front ones are showing some progress, but those to their sides that can still be seen when talking or smiling show the strips are not going wide enough across our width.</li>
            <li> you have even minor sensitivity in your teeth</li>
            <li> They worked but they weren&#x27;t as white as I expected</li>
            <li> so I was not of the mind to want to continue use for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I mean, I think something is happening, perhaps it&#x27;s just my mind wanting to believe my teeth got whiter, but really, I don&#x27;t think they  did.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would have to accept discolored teeth because pain kept me from using other products long enough for them to take affect.</li>
            <li> Their off-white yellow was embarrassing at times, because my teeth already look sort of shifted out of place, and due to the color also looked uncared for.    </li>
            <li> I experimented with taking pictures at a specific distance or extreme close-ups.  </li>
            <li> I was in extreme pain for 2 hours after using these &amp;#34;gentler&amp;#34; version of the white strips.</li>
            <li> But over all, this product will definitely whiten you up a little bit over the short period you have to use them.</li>
            <li> I use them every other day to keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> No wonder I never thought of using these until it was the only thing left on the vine list that month a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The basic Vivid strips are obviously cheaper and can be a bit frustrating to adhere.</li>
            <li> Only reason for not giving it five stars is that after a month or so the white on my teeth is a little less white</li>
            <li> That single misstep didn&#x27;t seem to harm anything.    </li>
            <li> I used them on my way to work when I was less likely to talk and could let them sit for a thirty minute commute (the recommended time to keep them in each day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I explained I whitened only half my teeth to see if there was a difference.  </li>
            <li> Then I explained I whitened only half my teeth to see if there was a difference.  </li>
            <li> And THANK YOU BLACK FRIDAY for offering this for only $10 Bucks!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth became too sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t drink anything too hot or too cold.</li>
            <li> I can only wear them for about 15 minutes every other day, because I get these sharp lightening bolt pains in my Canine teeth, and my lower front teeth.  </li>
            <li> For the Vivid, it&#x27;s a little too harsh for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems before using this product, but afterwards, I was sensitive to cold water, and right in the front Not very much fun.  </li>
            <li> My little 15 minutes a couple of times a week gets me sparkling white.  </li>
            <li> I keep mine on a little bit longer than directed, followed by 3d white mouthwash and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but these really do reduce the yellow.</li>
            <li> The strips kept slipping off of my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, these strips gave me no pain issues and with the lower dose of whiting product, did what was expected of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recently quit smoking a few months ago</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference, but my teeth were definitely whiter than they were.</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to waste more money.  </li>
            <li> It was bad enough that I waited an extra day after the first two applications so the irritation would go away.  </li>
            <li> If I wear them for 30 minutes my teeth hurt and ache for the rest of the day and night, and require some form of pain relief medicine; which is crazy because I have a high pain tolerance, and DO NOT have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you do get them in place on your teeth, there&#x27;s really no mechanism by which they might stay in place, and certainly not for 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> Keeping the strips on for more than a few minutes without them sliding off or tearing is nigh impossible</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> Only in the past 1 out of 42 years have I gotten into the on and off habit of flossing once a week with one of those sticks that has a removable floss head--which looks something like a cheese</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done any at-home whitening solutions (other than maybe what is in the toothpaste itself), and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> time I will try some other crest stripes.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews complaining about the pain.</li>
            <li> other issue I had was teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The strips are extremely flimsy and not durable at all (like plastic wrap)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend hundreds at a dentist--regular use of these got my teeth looking tops in a couple of weeks, and I have tried other brands.</li>
            <li> well, ive tried other crest whitestrips and never had problems like these</li>
            <li> I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> It was pretty uncomfortable, and with the unnoticeable change in tooth color, not worth it.    </li>
            <li> The stips don&#x27;t stick to the teeth, obviously making it extremely hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I saw some results after the 10 day cycle, but it is hard to be completely objective when you&#x27;re looking in the mirror at yourself.  </li>
            <li> Now for the bad part, the strips are very unwieldy and hard to get onto your teeth straight.  </li>
            <li> I just decided to throw them away because the pain from the sensitivity was so not worth the out</li>
            <li> For the time I had these on, they didn&#x27;t really hurt, per se, but they were certainly uncomfortable.     </li>
            <li> I remember we watched a movie in class and someone had commented in amazement at my teeth being practically glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are messy, and have created a little bit of sensitivity in my teeth that I normally NEVER have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my enamel has gone very thin, however they don&#x27;t cause so much pain&lt;</li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s half of the beauty battle.    </li>
            <li> I seriously want my money back.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthier, puts less chemicals in your mouth, and costs less.</li>
            <li> The strips are too small, they only cover a small portion of the front side of your teeth</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know how Crest expects a person to keep them on for half an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe a slight brightening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did find it would cause a slight tingling sensation once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Bruxism sufferers, I also noted increased sensitivity to hot and cold while using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the initial irritation, I stuck to the directions, leaving the strips on for at least half an hour each day, usually around 45 minutes before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> I still think that this would probably work, but unfortunately these strips will not stick to my teeth long enough for them to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> They burn my mouth a little which is a little bothersome but not intolerable.</li>
            <li> If youre not familiar with that, look it up.</li>
            <li> they make my teeth a little whiter?</li>
            <li> Felt like there was little or no result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward process but gets easier after the 2nd or 3rd application.  </li>
            <li> The cost is approximately the same</li>
            <li> Time to try another brand in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and it said that it was NOT permanent and they SHOULD go away within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> These are a waste but returning things on Amazon is futile.</li>
            <li> For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Will lighten you teeth a few shades.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money, all a scam.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Itts messy and doesnt stick to your teeth well at all.  </li>
            <li> These strips do work as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic result because this box contains only a few days supply.     </li>
            <li> Day 1, I put them on and upon removing them I noticed dramatic white spots.  </li>
            <li> These strips are not easy to apply and slip around on your teeth, plus you can taste the yucky gel stuff on them.  </li>
            <li> And the pain was not worth the hardly noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried whitening my teeth by simply rinsing my mouth out with hydrogen peroxide twice a day which failed, but I thought that perhaps sticking hydrogen peroxide to my teeth for an elongated period of time</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product wont work like it&#x27;s supposed to if you&#x27;re not really committed to using it correctly, however I did notice some result even in my very lazy trial of the product on my teeth, and therefore can recommend it even for those who will be chronically lazy about it</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like how the strips stuck so tightly to the teeth and were hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t tested them.he strips on for at least half an hour each day, usually around 45 minutes before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, as well as shown on the product chart, this is a messy product that is hard to keep in place.</li>
            <li> It can also be difficult to correctly position these on your teeth for an even white.    </li>
            <li> Not sure why, maybe moisture/adhesion reasons.</li>
            <li> Probably not a good product for someone with really dark teeth</li>
            <li> That was a waste!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I went with these because I was not sure how my teeth would handle the strips.  </li>
            <li> I found the Crest Whitestrips to be very messy, hard to position and not very effective.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is how expensive these are.</li>
            <li> These stripes are hard to keep on.  </li>
            <li> They were hard to put on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know whether these strips work to whiten teeth or not.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t the diseased butter biscuits you see at the dentist&#x27;s office, but definitely in the yellowed category.</li>
            <li> At least there you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time placing the strips on my teeth but once on, they worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this product is worthless; a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, this product is worthless; a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The strips are weak and tear/rip easily, usually when putting them on&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that upon receipt of above product the nomenclature stated that this was only a Level 2 whitening system.  </li>
            <li> seriously</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They stick to themselves, and are almost impossible to \\&quot;unstick.\\&quot; Even when I managed to get them on my teeth, they did not stay put...but folded back on themselves like they had a life of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as described, however, a little too expensive for what it</li>
            <li> The plastic strips are so thin that it&#x27;s hard to handle them without their folding and scrunching.</li>
            <li> these 3D Crest White Strips hurt my teeth sooo badly though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to throw away a few strips because they slipped out of my hands or otherwise became unusable.     </li>
            <li> Also the strips are messy and difficult to keep in place.</li>
            <li> These (vivid) strips are awful and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was gooey, messy, tastes bad and is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I suppose the upside is that I don&#x27;t need fake ugly teeth for my next years Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D Whitestrips is not a great product.</li>
            <li> The Vivid are terrible.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am a little disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> They are also difficult to keep on your teeth and the 30 minutes can seem like hours while you try not to move your lips or teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of teeth whiteners</li>
            <li> I do find the strips uncomfortable to put on, they tended to slip around.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was how uncomfortable they were.</li>
            <li> am also not impressed by result.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Consumer-style strips like this are unlikely to whiten as well as a dentist&#x27;s trays.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d forget to put them on every day, and every time I was determined &#x27;this is the week&#x27; I just didn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> I worried I might end up with awkward looking teeth depending on how well the whitestrips work</li>
            <li> I am quite unhappy that I was duped into purchasing one of the lowest levels of whitening.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still in bad pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of people give these bad reviews but that&#x27;s because a lot of people neglect their teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li> The application can be  painful</li>
            <li> Plus which, these strips make you salivate like mad!</li>
            <li> Like an IDIOT</li>
            <li> I hate that I didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> I just hate the way they feel.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are the worst.</li>
            <li> these are absolutely terrible</li>
            <li> The strips don&#x27;t stay, they leave this nasty taste in your mouth, the strips don&#x27;t just \\&quot;Disolve\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> I started feeling terrible shooting pains in my teeth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> they are fine for the price</li>
            <li> You know how they say the birth control pill could be 99% effective if used correctly, but in actuallity, it&#x27;s 80% effective because people don&#x27;t? That&#x27;s sort of how I feel about these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that many users of these strips tend to have trouble getting these to stick to their bottom teeth (Crest recommends doing top and bottom separately), and you have to be disciplined enough to take about 10 minutes of your day out to use them. That&#x27;s not a big demand, but if you&#x27;re like me, you still don&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that these are clinically proven to work if you use as directed and cheaper than other whitening treatments, but be ready for the effort. Personally, I think I&#x27;d have more luck with whitening toothpaste or a one-stop visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I bought these in hopes to whiten my teeth. I paid 30 dollars for the at rite aid and they are good but even after the first use my teeth were so sore. plus for 10 dollars more i could have gotten the ones that start showing effects in 3 days. it takes awhile for these ones to work.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they say they do, whiten your teeth. However it only whitened them for about a week or so, I take care of my teeth, however if you want visibly whiter teeth for a good 2 months your going to need the 2-hour ones. These whiten by about 2 shades, nothing to notice in daylight but indoors quite visible.</li>
            <li> Your view of this product will depend on what your goal is.  Are you trying to get perfectly white teeth?  Of course, this won&#x27;t be your solution.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of whitening that will last a couple of months, these will work nicely.  It also is pretty important that you have somewhat flat teeth.  My top set of teeth is level and flat, so the strips stuck to them easily.  My bottom set is not as straight, so the strip didn&#x27;t stick easily there.  Therefore, my top teeth definitely had more of a whiter appearance than my bottom ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is the kind of product you would buy if you want some brief whitening (such as say, before a wedding or other special occasion).</li>
            <li> These strips visibly whitened my teeth; I noticed a difference after two uses. They are large enough to cover all visible areas and your teeth will stay whiter for a decent amount of time. They are cheaper than getting this done at the dentist.    The only problem is if you have sensitive teeth or gums. As long as you stick to the guidelines for use you should be okay but if you go over the amount of time or use them too frequently you can experience sensitivity. It can also be difficult to correctly position these on your teeth for an even white.    Overall these are a legitimate option for teeth whitening and I would get them again.</li>
            <li> These work well, but not the first time you use one. Theres a reason they give you 10, but their great. They will make your teeth noticeably whiter after you&#x27;re done with the pack.  I drink a ton of coffee and they really do work.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D Whitestrips are a quality product and a very good value for whitening your teeth at home. Although they cannot compare to professional tooth whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, they are a smart product to use in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> These strips do work as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic result because this box contains only a few days supply.     It takes some time to figure out how to place the strips perfectly. Unfortunately, I had to throw away a few strips because they slipped out of my hands or otherwise became unusable.     I would recommend buying one of the bigger sets of strips if you&#x27;re just starting to whiten your teeth. For the occasional whitening, the 10-count box is great, though. Just be sure to master the art of placing these on your teeth. Once you&#x27;ve got that figured out, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, as well as shown on the product chart, this is a messy product that is hard to keep in place. It slides around and the product feels like goo in your mouth. For all the trouble, I did not see much whitening. It may be that my stains are from tetracycline use as a kid vs coffee and tea stains. However, some on here have had success. And my dentist has given out samples of OTC whiteners so at this low price, try it out. However, you might want to try the more expensive version shown on the chart that stays in place better and is stronger.</li>
            <li> It does actually work and the wonder is that it does work in a such a short period of time...I had a date was coming up in three days and I wanted to whiten my teeth as much as possible. I am not smoker, yet I drink coffee and tea a lot. I used it for three consecutive days right before....and I was really pleased with it...well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of Crest White Strips before and have always seen great results and experienced no pain...these 3D Crest White Strips hurt my teeth sooo badly though. I keep them on for the instructed time and when I take them off my teeth ache and continue to ache the whole next day.  I&#x27;ve tried them about 4 times now (1 a month), hoping my teeth would get used to them, and they still ache.  No thanks!</li>
            <li> I actually took a picture of my teeth before I started the regimen just to be able to document for myself if, and how much change there was.  Using a standard color chart I was able to see that after ten days my teeth were two shades whiter, more than that they had less of a yellow &#x27;tinge&#x27;.      Now for the bad part, the strips are very unwieldy and hard to get onto your teeth straight.  Just as you get used to using them, the supply runs out.  They are also difficult to keep on your teeth and the 30 minutes can seem like hours while you try not to move your lips or teeth.  But I&#x27;ve always been told that the cost of beauty is pain or in this case annoyance.  So choose a time when you won&#x27;t be thirsty, talkative or mirthful.      Zeb Kantrowitz</li>
            <li> I used the Crest 3D Whitestrips as directed and was very impressed by the improved whiteness of my teeth. I always had naturally white teeth as a kid, but coffee and time had yellowed them and now I think they are as white as they used to be! I did experience some sensitivity after using them, especially the first few times. I started using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that really seemed to help. The strips were easy to apply and weren&#x27;t too much of an annoyance while in use. I had the most trouble getting the dang envelope they were in open, I always seemed to tear it either to high so the pack didn&#x27;t open or too low so I caught the sheet of strips, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal. Definitely a more economical option than trays from the dentist!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m supposed to floss every day, but do I?  Of course not.  Only in the past 1 out of 42 years have I gotten into the on and off habit of flossing once a week with one of those sticks that has a removable floss head--which looks something like a cheese slicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I signed up to review the Crest 3D Whitestrips which require that I stick these things on my teeth every day for ten days, as you can imagine, it became more like 10 weeks.  I was afraid I&#x27;d forget to put them on every day, and every time I was determined &#x27;this is the week&#x27; I just didn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do you get out of this review by a dental hygene procrastinator?  The fact that you really have to mean it to do your own tooth whitening, or simply pay a professional to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product wont work like it&#x27;s supposed to if you&#x27;re not really committed to using it correctly, however I did notice some result even in my very lazy trial of the product on my teeth, and therefore can recommend it even for those who will be chronically lazy about it as I have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way: If you don&#x27;t use it as prescribed it probably wont work as well as it would if you did, HOWEVER it&#x27;s such a cheap thing to try and do yourself that it&#x27;s worth the attempt.  Therefore my recommendation is to try this first and if you don&#x27;t get the results you wanted then go ahead and ask your dentist about a professional whitening.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D Whitestrips are great for whitening teeth. Use only once a day and see results in a short amount of time. I was very impress withe the outcome. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found the Crest Whitestrips to be very messy, hard to position and not very effective.  I compared this gel to the whitening gel I purchase from my dentist.  The cost is approximately the same and I get 15 treatments from my dentist and the results are immediate.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like how it whitened my teeth in such a short amount of time, however, it hurt my teeth a lot. On my 3rd day i had a big headache due to sensitivity. If you have very sensitive teeth like me, you will probably also want to have some Motrin available too. Overall, i think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s cheap plus it works.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White White strips Vivid are a new entry level product in the Crest White Strip teeth whitening line.    This is a quality product.  Indeed, these appear the same strips that began the Crest White Strip line many years ago.  The only change? The original product came with a 14 day supply, 24 sets of strips.  This product comes with ten applications, which at twice a day, is a five day supply.  This is therefore a short treatment.  It will get you on the road so to speak, towards whitening.  Furthermore, if you recently completed a longer period with the White Strips, these might good for a \\&quot;touch up,\\&quot; several months later.    Therefore, this is an \\&quot;entry,\\&quot; or a \\&quot;touch up,\\&quot; product in my opinion, in the line.    If you need more whitening, I would suggest a longer kit.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.  You could also simply use a couple boxes of this kit back to back I imagine, though check the directions.     Honestly, the product works.  I have used Crest White Strips for years.  I must admit though I have throttled back my use because they do make my teeth extremely sensitive.  I cannot go more than several applications without causing extreme sensitivity to my teeth. I will probably not use them in the future.  However, it&#x27;s worth a try.  If the sensitivity is too much, stop the strips.  I always recommend consulting your dentist if you have any questions or want to make sure it&#x27;s a good product for you</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of teeth whiteners and I decided to give them a try. I was very impressed. My teeth were not very dark but I did notice a change.</li>
            <li> I used about 4 days in a row and saw some visible change, maybe by a shade. Don&#x27;t expect too much though, otherwise you might fret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the tray from the dentist, the one you have to get fitted for with a mold and use the peroxide gel.  The tray from the dentist works great, the whitestrips from Crest so-so, not nearly that great of a result.  I mean, I think something is happening, perhaps it&#x27;s just my mind wanting to believe my teeth got whiter, but really, I don&#x27;t think they  did.  I do find the strips uncomfortable to put on, they tended to slip around.  I used them on my way to work when I was less likely to talk and could let them sit for a thirty minute commute (the recommended time to keep them in each day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they were just okay for me, nothing like the results you&#x27;ll get from a dentist.  Still, I guess they are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other teeth whitening products at home and, like this one, they always make my teeth hurt afterwards, but I was taken aback by how quickly this one gets noticeable results. The tooth sensitivity doesn&#x27;t last long, just a day or so, and after four applications spaced over two weeks my teeth are a lot whiter. I thought I would have to accept discolored teeth because pain kept me from using other products long enough for them to take affect. This got results much faster, so I didn&#x27;t need to do as many applications to get the whiteness I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had an upcoming vacation that I wanted to look nice for. My teeth weren&#x27;t the diseased butter biscuits you see at the dentist&#x27;s office, but definitely in the yellowed category. Their off-white yellow was embarrassing at times, because my teeth already look sort of shifted out of place, and due to the color also looked uncared for.    I didn&#x27;t want anything heavy-hitting -- for one, it would set off alarms with people that saw me frequently. Secondly, I was also nervous about sensitivity; I didn&#x27;t know where my own gums would be on the pain scale, possibly having to space these out to every other day.     Plus, I simply didn&#x27;t couldn&#x27;t afford the higher-up kits. I figured I&#x27;d get the Vivid on sale and get a clear idea of how the system all works. That way, if this happens again in the future I can make an informed decision from experience.    They apply decently. I made the mistake of brushing before reading the enclosed info, thinking \\&quot;Ah, I&#x27;ll do them a favor and get the surface all nice and clean.\\&quot; They say not to do that. Not sure why, maybe moisture/adhesion reasons. That single misstep didn&#x27;t seem to harm anything.    The good news! I just stick them in and close my mouth -- top teeth touching bottom teeth-- breathing through my nose and trying to stem off the salivation it provokes (in me). They&#x27;re honestly hard to notice if you have them pressed on gently to stick, and they remove easily.    Once off, I always think I see that night&#x27;s improvement but wait till I&#x27;ve gone through the whole next day seeing it in different lights (bathroom mirror with incandescent, car mirror with sunlight, work mirror with fluorescent, etc.). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s on the package but if you look it up there&#x27;s only an extra two days&#x27; wait to \\&quot;see results.\\&quot; They also say they&#x27;re all supposed to be delivering the same effort with different doses/concentrations.    I will say with my particular case (VERY little soda caffeine, no coffee or tea or alcohol) I noticed a little bit aftera couple days, and halfway through am already pleased. It&#x27;d almost be worth the price if it stopped here but I&#x27;m excited to get just a little more out of it.    The two biggest payoffs are that they&#x27;re actually brighter, even at similar hues to what they were before, if that makes sense, and also, that the staining (or lack thereof) gets so much more even-looking. For me, that&#x27;s half of the beauty battle.    As far as pain/sensitivity goes, I was fortunate. I felt a tingle for a few minutes, but it was enough to remember the days of pouring peroxide on my cuts and not nearly enough to resemble actual pain. You&#x27;d hurt yourself more holding carbonated water on your tongue for too long. It&#x27;s a tiny, foamy tingle (again, for me).    My recommendation is to pick up the associated whitening toothpaste (the 90% of surface stains in 14 days) one. It&#x27;s well-reviewed on here and seems to augment the effect VERY well.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are the worst. They do not stay in place, especially the lower teeth. I was able to keep the upperstrip on for almost 30 minutes, but the lower strip falls off within a few minutes. I guess I will have whiter upper teeth. I have used Crest Whitestrips in the past, but I think I must have bought the Advanced Vivid, which stayed in place. These (vivid) strips are awful and a waste of money. Spend a little more and get the Advanced Vivid which stay in place. Some customers wrote in that these strips burned or caused pain. I didn&#x27;t have that problem, probably because they don&#x27;t stay in place long enough to cause any pain!</li>
            <li> The TV and print ads market these types of items as simple and easy to use yet this item was sticky, difficult to adjust correctly on the teeth and just didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to review these strips because I couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to evaluate them properly.  I experimented with taking pictures at a specific distance or extreme close-ups.  There was just too much variance from one picture to the next to be able to come up with an objective before-and-after picture.  Later I had one of those \\&quot;Doh\\&quot; moments after realizing I didn&#x27;t have to take a picture at all.  Since I have a top and bottom set of teeth, I could simply use the strips on one set and leave the other set as-is.  Both sets of teeth would be eating and drinking the same items so I should be able to make an accurate comparison.  I realize a movement from one shade of white to another is almost undetectable but \\&quot;visible whitening\\&quot;, as the advertising claims, should be easy to spot.  I worried I might end up with awkward looking teeth depending on how well the whitestrips work but it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve embarrassed myself for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each whitestrip comes in a flat foil package and contains two strips, one for the uppers and another for the lowers.  Crest has done a pretty good job of making the peroxide stay on the strip in gel form as you peel it off but any slip while putting on the strips and the gel will wipe on whatever it touches.  It&#x27;s an awkward process but gets easier after the 2nd or 3rd application.  For me, the bigger issue was the irritation these strips cause to my gums.  In spite of my current redneck residence, I was blessed with a full set of teeth and no overbite.  These strips fold over the teeth to the point where the gel gets on to the gums and in between teeth.  I suppose it&#x27;s good for complete coverage of the teeth but it really irritates the gums.  It was bad enough that I waited an extra day after the first two applications so the irritation would go away.  Bruxism sufferers, I also noted increased sensitivity to hot and cold while using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the initial irritation, I stuck to the directions, leaving the strips on for at least half an hour each day, usually around 45 minutes before going to bed.  Once the box was finished I started asking people if they noticed a difference in my teeth without telling them why.  Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary.  Then I explained I whitened only half my teeth to see if there was a difference.  Still no one could see a difference (and neither could I).  Laughably, a couple of people said something along the lines of \\&quot;Now that you mention it, the top does look whiter than the bottom.\\&quot;  I used the whitestrips on the bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is worthless; a complete waste of money.  The \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice.  There are \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; options that are purported to provide more dramatic results but I haven&#x27;t tested them.he strips on for at least half an hour each day, usually around 45 minutes before going to bed.

            <li> Well I just finished the box of 10, and I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s a difference. My front teeth are lighter than my molars, but that could be from the last brand of whitestrips I tried 7 months ago; they were different before starting this box. So they ended up being somewhere between 0 and 2 shades.    Also, on day 4, I had to take a break, as the strips started causing a constant stinging sensation on my front teeth. It went away after a day, and came back after another 3 days of using the strips. It was pretty uncomfortable, and with the unnoticeable change in tooth color, not worth it.    Time to try another brand in a few weeks. Weeeeee</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D Whitestrips is not a great product. It was gooey, messy, tastes bad and is hard to apply. The Whitestrips did not do for me anymore than what a regular toothbrush and toothpaste could do. If you want whiter teeth, good old fashioned baking soda could do a better job than this stuff. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> It took 5 strips just to whiten my teeth one shade and it made my teeth so sensitive I didn&#x27;t even want to eat anything for 12 hours on average after using them for just 5 days I just decided to throw them away because the pain from the sensitivity was so not worth the out come after just 5days  these are absolutely terrible I would NEVER recomend these to anyone</li>
            <li> These stripes are hard to keep on.  They slip off too easily and don&#x27;t whiten that well.  You have to use the whole box to notice any difference if at all.  Go to the dentist and pay the money for a professional cleaning.  At least there you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of Crest toothpaste for the past ten years or so, so when I heard that they were coming out with Crest teeth whitening strips, I was immediately intrigued and decided to give them a try. I will say after using them for several weeks, they definitely are successful in whitening the teeth and making them look overall a lot more healthy and attractive. The one drawback I experiences is that my teeth became relatively sensitive after using the strips so expect a bit of discomfort even if you take care of your teeth religiously.</li>
            <li> They definitely helped whiten my teeth. :D&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to all of my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> First of all when amazon sent me this they didn&#x27;t even send it to me in a box they sent it to me in a bag. Secondly these &#x27;white&#x27; strips don&#x27;t even work i have 3 left and i haven&#x27;t seen a change. They don&#x27;t even stay in one place and you can&#x27;t even talk. I seriously want my money back. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am using these white strips as I write this review and I have to say I am a little disappointed in them. I used some Crest White strips a few months ago which were the Advanced Vivid strips and I LOVED THEM! The Advanced Vivid strips adhered to my teeth better, so I never had to taste the gross whitening goop, and they seemed to whiten a little better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the Vivid strips will whiten your teeth but when I compare it to the Advanced Vivid I will from now on spend the extra money on those. The basic Vivid strips are obviously cheaper and can be a bit frustrating to adhere. I have a built in retainer and so the bottom strip never folds over my teeth like it should. The Advanced Vivid strips are shaped to more easily adhere to your teeth and I never had an issue with those. This is just a lesson learned for me.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used two days of the treatments and my teeth are noticeably white. However I have been experiencing some pain but not until after the second treatment. It is quite obnoxious but I really want my teeth to be white for my wedding so I think I&#x27;m going to continue using them but not every day and I most likely will not use the whole box...</li>
            <li> I believe this is a good product. It kind of hurt at the beginning when you apply it to your teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth. But overall, it gradually whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN! I hated it. The strips don&#x27;t stay, they leave this nasty taste in your mouth, the strips don&#x27;t just \\&quot;Disolve\\&quot;..They leave little mini strips in your mouth which are sticky, You can barely get the strips on in the first place..</li>
            <li> This is my go-to use for a quick whitening. Love the results and outcome for such a great price. And THANK YOU BLACK FRIDAY for offering this for only $10 Bucks!!! What a steal...................</li>
            <li> Works great....brightened my teeth in no time........will purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like having a bright white smile....it&#x27;s a must</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m so glad I made the change from whitening trays. I&#x27;m satisfied and I will be buying this product again soon. ;) &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth much, I am a daily coffee drinker so it didn&#x27;t work that well for me.  I guess this is only for those teeth that is just a bit tinted.</li>
            <li> I bought Crest Whitestrips as a gift to myself for quitting smoking.  I was so excited since I used similar strips years ago and had had good results.  Day 1, I put them on and upon removing them I noticed dramatic white spots.  Horrified I checked the Q&amp;A in the box and it said that it was NOT permanent and they SHOULD go away within a few hours.  I woke up the next day and they were STILL there.  Like an IDIOT I believed what the pamphlet said and went forward with Day 2.  Alas, more spots.  I proceeded with Day 3 (today) and to no one&#x27;s blame but my own. I ended up with white spots on the front upper tooth.  I have a big smile which is one of my best attributes, but now my best attribute comes with spots all over them.  SO, I traded in my cigarette stained teeth for cigarette stained spotted teeth.  I suppose the upside is that I don&#x27;t need fake ugly teeth for my next years Halloween costume. Now I need to call my dentist, hopefully not in tears and see what he tells me to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done any at-home whitening solutions (other than maybe what is in the toothpaste itself), and decided to give this a try. It look me longer than the 10 days indicated, but I did start to see a result in about 12 days. Not a huge difference, but my teeth were definitely whiter than they were. My biggest problem was how uncomfortable they were. I do have relatively sensitive teeth, so that may have been part of the problem. For the time I had these on, they didn&#x27;t really hurt, per se, but they were certainly uncomfortable.     Would I try them again? Yes. I don&#x27;t expect a product like this to be a replacement for a whitening trip to the dentist, but it&#x27;s not a bad in between (if you can stand how they feel), especially if you&#x27;re one who isn&#x27;t able to see the dentist every 6 months.</li>
            <li> People that whiten their teeth regularly may not see the results that much, but for those that are just now starting off - this is a great product.  The price is reasonable for the results.  This is much more expensive than whitening toothpaste treatments, but the results occur much faster.  I used whitening toothpaste along with an electric toothbrush for what I thought was good results.  Over a month, the results were noticeable.  But after trying the Crest 3D strips, the results were even more noticeable in only a week.  My thoughts, this is a great starting product with quicker results than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips are among my favorite cosmetic products!  I consistently receive compliments on my smile.  Amazon always has great prices, too.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these strips so I&#x27;m not sure if they will do a good job but have high hopes that they will. They burn my mouth a little which is a little bothersome but not intolerable. They stay on my teeth and don&#x27;t slide around and are easy to apply to both upper and lower teeth so I like the convenience. And they&#x27;re so much better than messy trays. I bought them at a local store for a much lower price so probably won&#x27;t be ordering them from Amazon unless I can&#x27;t find them in the stores near my home anymore.</li>
            <li> These are definitely cheap, easy, and work! It was way better ordering these than buying them in a store (and I work in a Target with a discount!) So, if you&#x27;re thinking of buying these, just do it!</li>
            <li> The solution tends to burn, but otherwise, it does the job, for the most part. It could be better as for the whitening part.</li>
            <li> These suck. They dont stay on your teeth. DONT BUY THEM... buy ones with the advanced seal on them. THEY SUCK</li>
            <li> These are the old fashioned whitening strips which do not adhere to your teeth so consequently the slide off your teeth if you talk, drink anything, etc.  The only ones to order are the advanced seal professional effects.  These are a waste but returning things on Amazon is futile.</li>
            <li> like i thought it would taste minty and but it has no taste. the only thing is it makes you speak like u have spit in your mouth... but its ok, and i started to see the difference after two uses... seriously</li>
            <li> Not fast-it&#x27;s a multi-day treatment but very good.  I used each each morning while I applied make-up! The strips are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 of 20 treatments that came in the Professional Effects box.  I can already see a difference.  My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly white, but I can definitely see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some tooth sensitivity, particularly on my lower front teeth and gums.  But, it goes away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think these strips deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I have bought these types of products form crest before.  I guess because this is the lowe end of this type of product I am having problems with it.  The stips don&#x27;t stick to the teeth, obviously making it extremely hard to use.  I recommend buying the high end product from crest.  For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These white strips hurt my teeth a lot. I am probably more sensitive than most,&lt;br /&gt;since my enamel has gone very thin, however they don&#x27;t cause so much pain&lt;br /&gt;that it is unbearable, just sensitivity and uncomfortableness. It goes away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;They do their job, whiten my teeth, not crazy celebrity white, but at least brighten them up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just happy they whiten my teeth, since just toothpaste/floss/mouthwash alone&lt;br /&gt;will not do the job, and they&#x27;re cheaper than getting special treatments at the dentists&lt;br /&gt;for hundreds of dollars. I got them for a great price too, so I&#x27;m content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT; I have been continuously using these strips, and I must say, they hurt my teeth more than I thought, I thought they would get used to them. They don&#x27;t stay on, and it is a chore to keep them in place. They haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth all that much either. I used a better form of this before, so I guess I was expecting too much. Save yourself the money, and buy the better version of these strips, with less pain and better results.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but it did not stay white as long as they claimed it to be. Recommended because it works</li>
            <li> great product arrived on time and worked just like it said it would.  Only reason for not giving it five stars is that after a month or so the white on my teeth is a little less white</li>
            <li> I got these strips from CVS. They don’t  stay aligned. Thses stripes keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;I am also not impressed by result.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will try some other crest stripes. Not this one!</li>
            <li> Careful if you have sensitive teeth. I was in extreme pain for 2 hours after using these &amp;#34;gentler&amp;#34; version of the white strips. And the pain was not worth the hardly noticeable difference. I suggest LUSTER whitening toothpaste. Works WONDERS!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked the product but since i got the vivid, it was the least whitening, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I would recommend it though, just get the higher levels if you want to clearly see a change.</li>
            <li> I saw results as early as the 3rd day. It was fantastic, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my teeth whitened and my dentist just took my braces off.</li>
            <li> The strips kept slipping off of my teeth. They don&#x27;t stay on too good, not impressed with them at all.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price, just didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped. there are more expensive options, but these help a decent amount without spending $200</li>
            <li> They worked and did not make my teeth sensitive but people didn&#x27;t really notice how white my teeth were until I started oil pulling. If youre not familiar with that, look it up. I use coconut oil and it&#x27;s extremely effective and won&#x27;t cause sensitivity issues if that&#x27;s something youre concerned with. But over all, this product will definitely whiten you up a little bit over the short period you have to use them.</li>
            <li> Four have been used so far, I have six left and think whitening teeth is a lifelong ordeal. We go through a lot financially and time-wise trying to find a good product to use. More effective products need to be made available to us so we get to &#x27;truly&#x27; whiten our teeth on a regular basis.  If the strips were longer, they&#x27;d cover more teeth to the sides of the front ones. It seems to be that the front ones are showing some progress, but those to their sides that can still be seen when talking or smiling show the strips are not going wide enough across our width.</li>
            <li> Appears to work as promised.  Will lighten you teeth a few shades.  Probably not a good product for someone with really dark teeth, a dentist visit might be better for that person.  For the average person, who wants to save money, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I tried these strips about two weeks before family portraits and was very pleased with how they brightened my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;These strips are relatively inexpensive.  They are super portable, thinner than a credit card, which means you can take them with you to work, on trips, or to use in the car.  The whiten teeth fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;They do not stay on your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They whitening paste tastes nasty.&lt;br /&gt;No dramatic changes in tooth color, subtle at best.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product highly rated by consumers report.  I recomend it if you want to avoid costly dentist charges.</li>
            <li> I had used these whitening strips several years ago and did find visible improvement in the color of my teeth.  At that time I did feel some discomforting pain in my teeth, but not intolerable pain.  I decided it was time to re-whiten since I&#x27;m looking for a job so I tried them again--expecting the same results with minor discomfort.  HOLY COW!  About an hour after I removed my strips (and I did follow instructions!) I started feeling terrible shooting pains in my teeth.  The pain radiated into a headache which radiated to my eyes as well.  I have taken Ibupropin, as suggested in the web searches I did to see what I could do for relief and gargled with warm salt water.  It is now 9 hours later and I&#x27;m still in bad pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have even minor sensitivity in your teeth I suggest you do not use these.  The limited whitening they do (while visibly a bit better) is not worth the pain and suffering you endure.</li>
            <li> Works great! Miracle stuff.</li>
            <li> They worked but they weren&#x27;t as white as I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever tried the Listerine strips.&lt;br /&gt;They were fine, dissolved and were not as messy afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are messy, and have created a little bit of sensitivity in my teeth that I normally NEVER have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to discontinue use after only 3 days.  That was a waste!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product for those that want to improve their dental appearance. The only thing that I dislike about it, and this has nothing to do with the seller, but after three months of applying them, I already can tell that my teeth are returning back to normal color. Great service though!</li>
            <li> I love these whitening strips and I am pleased with the results although it is clear that I will need to use them about every 6 months for the extra white look.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips Vivid 3D worked only ok for me......probably lightened my teeth about 2 shades.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve heard a lot better reviews for Crests more expensive upper lines of whitening stripes. I would suggest just spending a bit more and getting one of the kits that will REALLY impress you. I will not be buying these again however, I will consider one of the more expensive kits.</li>
            <li> I have used the more expensive Professional Crest Whitening Strips and loved them. The Vivid are terrible. The bottom absolutely is useless and the top is hit or miss as far as staying on the teeth. I am not saying you won&#x27;t get any results, but since they slip off quickly there is little &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; time. I would give them a zero if I could.</li>
            <li> I use crest whitestrips 1-2 times per year. They changed something because these strips easily slide off my teeth.</li>
            <li> They keep sliding off!!!!</li>
            <li> It worked good for me. Excellent results after using the product. Easy to use and a lot cheaper than treatments offered at dental offices</li>
            <li> I did not notice the different &amp;#34;grades&amp;#34; of white strips when I ordered these, but the Vivid&#x27;s don&#x27;t whiten like the Professional Effects.  Will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I USE THEM SOMETIMES ;MY TEETH ARE NOT YELLOW BUT IT IS NICE TO USE ONCE IN A WHILE .THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT THEM .SO EASY TO USE NO PROBLEM AT ALL .I NO SOME PEOPLE CAN NOT USE THEM ;BECASUE THEY ARE ALWAYS EATING AND CAN&#x27;T KEEP THERE MOUTH SHUT FOR HAPF AN HOUR ;LOL .</li>
            <li> I read other reviews complaining about the pain. I&#x27;ve noticed no pain or discomfort though. The top strips stayed on very nicely, but sometimes the bottom strips slipped a little. It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal though. All you have to do is readjust them. For the most part, they fit well and I definitely noticed a whitening in my teeth. It was definitely significant. I think I would&#x27;ve liked them to turn out a little whiter, but vivid is the most basic type for Crest (there are professional effects, etc.). So for the type and price, I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> I like it because the strips are easy to use and you can see quick results. It really whitens your teeth!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how expensive these are. I love my whitestrips! :-D</li>
            <li> Health effects of getting those looks? Not so important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briefly: this makes sensitive teeth more sensitve, is kind of weird to use, and is inferior to simple daily personal dental hygiene using non-artificial chemical means. Plus which, these strips make you salivate like mad! Buckets of spit were just dripping out of my mouth while using them, to the point where you&#x27;d need to put a bib on. Ridiculous. No wonder I never thought of using these until it was the only thing left on the vine list that month a few years ago. Guess that&#x27;s why the review was neglected...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did they make my teeth a little whiter? Yes, but the various trade-offs (and rip-off price for a tiny bit of plastic plus cheap chemicals) add up to not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, a way overpriced product that&#x27;s a hassle to use. Why not just brush your teeth with a good natural paste a few times more per day? It&#x27;s healthier, puts less chemicals in your mouth, and costs less. Or you could just use a very dilute hydrogen peroxide solution as a mouth rinse. But that might make too much sense, and not give a massive multinational congomerate the profits they need to pay their exectuive bonuses this Xmas. Whoops!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money, all a scam. I got it expcting amazing results but I got like no results.</li>
            <li> Works as described, however, a little too expensive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution for people with sensitive teeth-For the Vivid, it&#x27;s a little too harsh for my teeth. My teeth became too sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t drink anything too hot or too cold.</li>
            <li> Consumer-style strips like this are unlikely to whiten as well as a dentist&#x27;s trays. But they will do at least some good for people who have coffee/cigarette stains, etc., so trying them first isn&#x27;t a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, though, that brilliantly white teeth result from good genes (in a very, very few people) or veneers. The color of teeth varies naturally from very white to almost black;  bleaching can only slightly change your natural color.</li>
            <li> Brightens my teeth as promised.  Very easy to use. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth needs to be whiter this is for you.</li>
            <li> These Crest Vivid Whitestrips are an improvement over the older ones, in that they stay on your teeth better and seem to do a better job of whitening in a lesser amount of time.  I saw some results after the 10 day cycle, but it is hard to be completely objective when you&#x27;re looking in the mirror at yourself.  Next time, I would take a photo before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some issues with them, though.  While they stayed in place better than other strips, they still didn&#x27;t stay put securely. I had to make a concerted effort to keep them in place.  30 minutes is longer than you think with strips over your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening agent is quite strong, and when I got on my lips accidently it stung until I was able to rinse the area off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue I had was teeth sensitivity.  I didn&#x27;t have problems before using this product, but afterwards, I was sensitive to cold water, and right in the front Not very much fun.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t permanent, but then again, neither was the whitening.</li>
            <li> So I got a box of these strips and I can&#x27;t even attest to their whitening power because the stars have to align for them to actually go on your teeth and stay there as advertised. Here are some problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The strips stick to themselves very easily and you won&#x27;t get them undone (like plastic wrap sticking to itself)&lt;br /&gt;2) The strips are extremely flimsy and not durable at all (like plastic wrap)&lt;br /&gt;3) The strips are weak and tear/rip easily, usually when putting them on&lt;br /&gt;4) The strips are too small, they only cover a small portion of the front side of your teeth&lt;br /&gt;5) The gel on the strips makes your teeth/gums sting and/or sensitive&lt;br /&gt;6) Keeping the strips on for more than a few minutes without them sliding off or tearing is nigh impossible, I don&#x27;t know how Crest expects a person to keep them on for half an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically if you want to test how good these will stay on your teeth, just cut out two, tiny strips of plastic wrap and try putting those on and keeping them on for half an hour</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. better off spending money for the more powerful crest strips.....wont buy these ever again. wish they werent so much money</li>
            <li> First off I want to say I&#x27;ve been using whitestrips for the last 3 years. I&#x27;m 19 now and all through highschool I&#x27;ve had that \\&quot;famous actor\\&quot; kind of white teeth if you know what I&#x27;m talking about. A lot of people give these bad reviews but that&#x27;s because a lot of people neglect their teeth to begin with. I brush my teeth for 6 minutes a day so my teeth are already white as it is. The whitestrips are designed to give you that extra edge, not turn you from meth head yellow to pearly white in a week like a lot of people think. They stick fine and I actually keep my mouth slightly open the whole time they&#x27;re on. I use them once a year, normally right before school starts and ALWAYS get compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Contrary to everything I read about how much the strips stick -- often too much -- these barely&lt;br /&gt;stayed on. Felt like there was little or no result. But appreciate that Crest gives a full refund!</li>
            <li> I am glad the strips didn&#x27;t fall off but I didn&#x27;t like how the strips stuck so tightly to the teeth and were hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that my gums were tingling for some hours after I removed the strips.&lt;br /&gt;I like the immediate and lasting whitening results.</li>
            <li> great price, great product</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of whitestrips and I must say they all seem to be about the same.  These strips are not easy to apply and slip around on your teeth, plus you can taste the yucky gel stuff on them.  I do have some teeth that are more sensitive and these did kinda hurt on those teeth, but so do the rest of the whitestrips.  I guess you need to think of the result and that IS whiter teeth that are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between using whitestrips I rinse with hydrogen peroxide every day and between using both of them my teeth stay pretty white.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this product for 8 days and it only came with 9 strips. First thing first I did not experience any sensitivity in my teeth and I did well with putting the strips on and keeping them secure on my teeth. They do not work!! Like I said I use them for 8 of the 9 days and theres no change in my teeth color. My teeth are not horribly stained but my teeth are not really white, so I wanted to use this product to get them a little lighter. I wasted my money and I wanted a beautiful smile for when I started school. (next tuesday) I hate that I didn&#x27;t get any results. It did make my gums darker and made white visible spots on my teeth. Thanks alot (sarcasm)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try out \\&quot;Crest Whitestrips\\&quot; for a while in order to whiten my teeth without using dye.  I had previously tried whitening my teeth by simply rinsing my mouth out with hydrogen peroxide twice a day which failed, but I thought that perhaps sticking hydrogen peroxide to my teeth for an elongated period of time (it&#x27;s one of the main ingredients in these strips) would make a bigger difference.  I still think that this would probably work, but unfortunately these strips will not stick to my teeth long enough for them to make any difference.  They are constantly sliding all over my mouth and will not stay in the same position for more than about five seconds unless I firmly keep my jaw clenched, which is quite uncomfortable to do for more than a few minutes.  Also, even if the strips would remain on my teeth for the 20 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to keep them on there, they don&#x27;t cover the full row of upper or lower teeth.  The strip only covers the front 7-8 teeth; the back molars don&#x27;t get anything.  I truly believe that these would whiten teeth well if they would stay firmly planted on the teeth, but because they slip completely off the teeth or up to the gums, I have to highly recommend not spending the money on this product.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband both used these for 2 weeks and did not see a difference at ALL. Waste of money. Rather just spend the extra money and go to the dentist for a teeth whitening</li>
            <li> I like crest products but they were not my favorite. I actually find using baking soda and the crest toothpaste more effective. They work but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick whitening when teeth become dingy and dull.  Works better when used with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because my 50 year old teeth, drenched in coffee everyday, really needed a bit of help.  I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how yellow they had become until I have started seeing in recent years, more and more people walking around with dazzling white teeth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went with these because I was not sure how my teeth would handle the strips.  My back teeth are sensitive and I thought my front teeth might share such tendencies if I put whiting strips on them.  Turns out, they didn&#x27;t have any pain issues at all with these.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get them on your teeth, just sit still and don&#x27;t talk.  These strips stayed on my teeth just fine if I gave them the 30 minutes of focus they needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will be my last and 10th day of using the strips.  I&#x27;ve gotta say, they have done what I was looking for.  My teeth are noticeably whiter and white enough for me to be happy with them.  I will use a whiting toothpaste from now on to hopefully keep them this white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star is because I&#x27;m assuming had I used the more strong strips, the results would have been even better.  However, these strips gave me no pain issues and with the lower dose of whiting product, did what was expected of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use again.</li>
            <li> Such a great product. Happy with it. Brightened my teeth in the first couple days I had it on for 20 mins I instead of 30 even. Loved it!</li>
            <li> the change in my teeth wasnot good they are just the same and is so growst i did not like it at all</li>
            <li> The white strips arrived so quickly and I have white teeth now!! I have no complaints. These things work great!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in stores, this product works pretty well. Would probably buy again if I needed to. Decently priced as well.</li>
            <li> Works perfect everytime! I use this 2 times a year and this product works perfect! It does exactly what it says</li>
            <li> I used these like the instructions state and made sure I followed the schedule to a T. The problem is that they just don&#x27;t whiten nearly as much as they should, yes I got a little bit whiter from using them but not nearly what they should be. I only got a couple shades at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of being able to whiten your teeth on your own time but it seems the only good results are going to be from going in somewhere and getting a treatment done. It would probably take 4 of these boxes to even come close to a decent result... I didn&#x27;t even have coffee the entire time I was using these, that&#x27;s mostly where my problems come from, coffee....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since quit the coffee but still need a better solution for getting my teeth back to white again.</li>
            <li> I use these once a month to keep my original whitening in check</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone with sensative teeth. The application can be  painful And it does not go away rapidly like promised. Also the strips are messy and difficult to keep in place. That&#x27;s probably why they don&#x27;t work well. Don&#x27;t believe the ads on this one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any resultsthat would cause me to buy this prosuct any more.  Really was looking forward to seeing the results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend hundreds at a dentist--regular use of these got my teeth looking tops in a couple of weeks, and I have tried other brands. This is an excellent product and a must-have staple for ME.</li>
            <li> these strips do not stay on your teeth well, ive tried other crest whitestrips and never had problems like these</li>
            <li> I cannot get these to stick to my teeth - they slide around and come off completely after only a few minutes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy the Professional Effects type instead. Those stick like glue AND whiten.</li>
            <li> Beauty is pain right?  Well, that&#x27;s what my mom always said when she was snatching my brains out with the hair brush.  Crest white strips work for me.  I can only wear them for about 15 minutes every other day, because I get these sharp lightening bolt pains in my Canine teeth, and my lower front teeth.  If I wear them for 30 minutes my teeth hurt and ache for the rest of the day and night, and require some form of pain relief medicine; which is crazy because I have a high pain tolerance, and DO NOT have sensitive teeth.  Oh well.  My little 15 minutes a couple of times a week gets me sparkling white.  I do this every couple of years to boost the smile :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I use to be a dental assistant, and used professional grade products with trays from the office, this works twice as well for me.</li>
            <li> Received a different box than advertised.  It doesn&#x27;t show in the picture or description the whitening power is a 2 out of 5 levels. If I would have known that I would&#x27;ve paid $10 more for the level 5.</li>
            <li> They were hard to put on and once you get them on they keep sliding off your teeth. I wouldnt buy again.</li>
            <li> Itts messy and doesnt stick to your teeth well at all.  Will never buy this product again.  Annd it hurts ur teeth</li>
            <li> this is like the &#x27;94 honda civic of teeth whitening. it ain&#x27;t fancy, it ain&#x27;t pretty, and it ain&#x27;t high tech...but it gets you to where you&#x27;re going. if you&#x27;re looking for a major overhaul, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you; but if you&#x27;re just looking to spruce your teeth up a bit, it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> After trying this for several days, my upper teeth became extremely sensitive and I have asked the supplier to let me return the remaining portion.  There was been no improvement in stains in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I tried the product as directed for the trial period and it simply did not work. The strips seemed kind of old or worn and it was hard to keep them attached to teeth as well. I&#x27;ll try another brand in the future.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the product really did work like it is supposed to. I will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li> I got these white strips to use as maintenance on my teeth after using the 3D strips for 7 days.  I use them every other day to keep my teeth white.  They don&#x27;t stick to your teeth as well as the 3D strips but I would recommend for maintenance.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist to get white teeth when you can buy this product and get literally instant results. I keep mine on a little bit longer than directed, followed by 3d white mouthwash and toothpaste. So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The people deliverying it are very kind and good to work with. Helps whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that upon receipt of above product the nomenclature stated that this was only a Level 2 whitening system.  No where in the purchase info was this revealed.  I am quite unhappy that I was duped into purchasing one of the lowest levels of whitening.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find any highly noticeable change to my teeth color, maybe a slight brightening.&lt;br /&gt;I did find it would cause a slight tingling sensation once in awhile. so I was not of the mind to want to continue use for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips for years, and was always very pleased with the results. At one point, I had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office, and I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between those results and the Crest product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these 3D things are just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, and most importantly, they&#x27;re IMPOSSIBLE to handle. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is...but every time I tried to put these on my teeth, it was like nailing Jello to a tree. They stick to themselves, and are almost impossible to \\&quot;unstick.\\&quot; Even when I managed to get them on my teeth, they did not stay put...but folded back on themselves like they had a life of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - they just didn&#x27;t work. I used to see results after just a couple of days with the old product...a whole box of these little monsters did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had never used whitestrips before, I would just assume I had \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; teeth or I was particularly uncoordinated. But I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used peroxide gel that I purchased online with teeth trays and my teeth whitened really nicely. These, I just don&#x27;t think are as effective. Firstly, they slip off of my teeth because the saliva builds up under the tray. I just hate the way they feel. As to their whitening power, I don&#x27;t feel I can really attest because I use them too infrequently. I&#x27;m sure they work fine, but I would really recommend just investing in a custom tray and some gel.</li>
            <li> Works OK but I found the sticking on the teeth a bit of a problem. Put the top one on first.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases. Everything was as described. I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but these really do reduce the yellow.</li>
            <li> I normally use the crest professional ones and I got these because they were cheaper.  They slide off a lot easier than the professional ones but they still do the job..you just cant drink water and talk a lot like you can with the crest professional ones.</li>
            <li> I have always been very pleased with crest white strips. I recently quit smoking a few months ago and so I bought this kind to remove any unwanted smoking stains. I didnt realize the huge difference that these do NOT have the advanced seal technology. So they will slide if you dont keep still and you have to readjust them occasionally. Its worth the extra cash to get the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips that do not move around and stick to your teeth. However, for the cost, these work good.</li>
            <li> These whiten decently, but the strength is low. They only hurt my teeth a couple times, and it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.</li>
            <li> I had no results whatsoever!  Perhaps te high end stuff works better but I am afraid to waste more money.  I&#x27;ll just ask my dentist.</li>
            <li> I first tried them in high school as every girl wants to look her best.. after one week I was amazed at how much whiter my teeth really were... (I would leave them on a liitle longer than recommended). I remember we watched a movie in class and someone had commented in amazement at my teeth being practically glow in the dark. Lol Nevertheless I used them again at prom.. (I am now 25 yrs of age) I have been asked since I was 15 yrs old, how do I get my teeth so white?!?! I&#x27;ve never told anyone except my 2 closest girlfriends.. to this day they are my best kept secret. I only use them like the week before holidays to brighten em back up..works everytime!!!  :-):-):-)</li>
            <li> Each time i use these it really does take stains away.  Easy to use and worth it!! I dont drink much coffee but it helps the stains from that.</li>
            <li> When I have my regular check-ups, both my dentist and the hygienist are always impressed with the color of my teeth.  The whitening results of these strips are remarkable.</li>
            <li> I never received my package but I got them from a store and they worked alright.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a 6month fix up, so I did not need the max strength. They were easy to put on and did not cause any pain (the up and up target brand did). My teeth are now free of my coffee stains and I have a boost in confidence! Definitely worth the price. (And cheaper than if you bought at the store!)</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for me; it creates sensitivities for my wife&#x27;s teeth ...</li>
            <li> Easy and simply to use and you get the result.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time placing the strips on my teeth but once on, they worked as expected.  Removed surface stains.  And I noticed a difference within 7 days as advertised.</li>
            <li> good product - have used in the past - couldn&#x27;t buy in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> These strips work, but it takes more than one box, and several treatments before you see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> These work but don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know whether these strips work to whiten teeth or not. The plastic strips are so thin that it&#x27;s hard to handle them without their folding and scrunching. If you do get them in place on your teeth, there&#x27;s really no mechanism by which they might stay in place, and certainly not for 30 minutes! Crest should be ashamed of themselves for this one.</li>
