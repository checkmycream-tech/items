    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>This soap was purchased for a traveling occasion as I&#x27;m attempting to perfect the one-bag packing technique while avoiding carrying liquids on the plane.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells like a pleasantly nondescript cup of Celestial Seasonings.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping considering the ingredient list.    </li>
            <li>Its a good concept</li>
            <li>Good for hair though.</li>
            <li>but this works good,</li>
            <li>You need to learn to get a good lather on it</li>
            <li>We love them!</li>
            <li>I too do not need to use a separate conditioner on my hair, which is amazing, and it is easier to comb out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I really enjoyed the shampoo bar, it is made out of good quality ingredients and it cleaned my hair nicely.  </li>

            <li>Hair drys nice.</li>
            <li>foams up nicely when washing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product which doesn&#x27;t add more plastic to the landfills, it&#x27;s biodegradeable, sulfate free and my hair looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li>beautifully cleaned but not stripped of natural oils (which keep hair looking &amp; feeling great), and as a bonus, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very very light lavender smell.</li>
            <li>Like you bar so much better.  </li>
            <li>I am a retired hairdresser and I have never used a better shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I love the convenience of the bar.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>seems worthwhile.</li>
            <li>This also extends the life of your shampoo bar :)</li>
            <li>USED, more than mouse, hair spray, and blow drying.</li>
            <li>but I love this one.</li>
            <li>the top sources are wheat and soy.</li>
            <li>Love it, so now I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for more flavors.  </li>
            <li>Favorite formulation.</li>
            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Tea Tree formula to see if it makes even more of a difference there).</li>
            <li>I love shampoo bars, I don&#x27;t need conditioner</li>
            <li>I love the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>i thought this one would smell better.  </li>
            <li>It is low-cost, long-lasting, natural and is good for your hair!</li>
            <li>It prefer the rose scent of the original formula over this one, though.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my hair feels very clean.</li>
            <li>love how it smells and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, has more body, and is easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>This gives me bouncy clean hair for 4 days!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am happy to say that none of my concerns so far have been warranted.</li>
            <li>It is shiny and soft and has great texture.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers really nicely and best of all it rinses out very easily, so no standing under the shower head for five minutes trying to rinse out my hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the original version is better?</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>i like the original better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different versions and have been happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>It easily produces lots of lather and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Recommend strongly to all.</li>
            <li>I guess the best way to describe it was that I felt like I had slightly thicker, coarser hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it  suds up fine.</li>
            <li>I will continue to be a loyal customer and hope these shampoo bars are available for years to come!</li>
            <li>Apply in the shower after shampooing/rinse and rinse lightly.</li>
            <li>so i purchased this bar shampoo hoping it would be a good two in one for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>far as the shampoo itself, this is by far the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It lays just right and looks shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Each bar has unique properties so you can truly customize to your hair type.</li>
            <li>The original soap was recommended on a \\&quot;one-bag packing site\\&quot; and being into herbs</li>
            <li>Two quick swipes on my hair and the lather is tremendous!</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and is so easy to use,  more gentle than the baking soda.</li>
            <li>I love knowing exactly what&#x27;s going on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Gets your hair really clean</li>
            <li>After 3 washings I could feel a difference, squeeky clean improvement.</li>
            <li>Would it really clean my hair and get all the products out of it that I use, 3)</li>
            <li>my curly hair is curlier, more manageable, and generally looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>Our state does humidity like no one else, but it doesn&#x27;t do it in February, so this product hasn&#x27;t truly been put to the full test</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and the way it made my actual hair feel and look</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is most likely a more unique thing to some people but beware that it is a possiblity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The herbal scent is a bit strange, but pleasant still.</li>
            <li>But it did arrive quickly to my home.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Special stuff... love the old fashioned fragrance!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell a huge difference between this one and the Original Formula.</li>
            <li>My hair is squeaky clean after washing, and it&#x27;s generally better to not have to strip the natural oils from your hair.</li>
            <li>If you get free shipping this buy is worth it, but if not check your health food store first.</li>
            <li>It doubles as a body wash too, great for taking on trips, saves on space and cuts down on shower clutter!</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this product, but using it once was enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, easy and natural.</li>
            <li>First I need to state that I am an avid no-poo-er, sulfate free for 3 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>EASY five stars for this find - one of my favorite new-to-me product discoveries in a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works just like their original formula, but with a very herb-y smell.</li>
            <li>This soap works very well and leaves my hair feeling clean and not stripped of</li>
            <li>The Original Formula is easier to find, and as far as the formulation, I see no difference between this one and the Original Formula.</li>
            <li>I am  becoming  Chemically sensitive</li>
            <li>Almost too clean, to the point that I really was hesitant to not use some conditioner the first time because my hair felt stripped out.</li>
            <li>hair feels wonderfully clean and doesn&#x27;t need an additional conditioner, since this bar doesn&#x27;t strip the natural (beneficial) oils, I LOVE the light &amp; fresh scent, and love how small a bar is compared to a bottle of regular shampoo, making it SUPER easy to pack for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, daily, on my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Then I was leary at the feeling after rinsing (it feels different than conditioned hair), but luckily I combed through it fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Great for if you have hard water.</li>
            <li>I have used this Ligget&#x27;s shampoo bar for years and really like it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this bar for a few weeks now (purchased locally,&lt;br /&gt;lower price) and couldn&#x27;t be more delighted and pleasantly surprised at what a fantastic product this is, what a terrific job it does on my hair - leaving it</li>
            <li>My hair feels cleaner, is more manageable and healthier since I made the switch from traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first bar shampoo i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I used a regular shampoo (Aveeno) and my hair was mostly okay again.</li>
            <li>At first it felt a bit oily, but after a short while (a couple of weeks at the most)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this quirky bar of shampoo a try!  </li>
            <li>My hair is a lot easier to work with and leave a pretty shine.</li>
            <li>Having a shampoo bar with a few ingredients is a good way to help.  </li>
            <li>But then I tried it on its own, without an extra conditioner, and WOW!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the other kind worked for me but not this one.</li>
            <li>They really are a friggin miracle for unforgivingly oily hair that needs to be washed daily (or more often).</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair has become so nice since I stopped dying it and using conventional hair products.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s pretty much my method.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen much progress compared to drugstore shampoos!</li>
            <li>I have used JR Liggetts bar shampoo in the past and had good results, but this herbal formula did not work out for me.</li>
            <li>I have short, colored, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This bar has a pretty decent weight &amp; density for its size.</li>
            <li>I also wish they had larger bars available as I think that would also help keep the bar from disappearing so fast.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and makes his scalp feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle shampoo or even really concerned with saving the planet</li>
            <li>I never knew my hair could have so much body.</li>
            <li>it has a very drying sticky consistency when you use it in the shower, but seems to leave my hair oily afterwards.</li>
            <li>How much it would lather without what I thought to be \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; ingredients, 2)</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair is really wet, and I rub it on my scalp and the lather happens with the friction of the soap and my hair.</li>
            <li>I also notice you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as much with these bars.  </li>
            <li>Really like the soap.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair feeling a bit less silky than a conventional or even an all natural liquid shampoo, but it looked nice and still felt nice.  </li>
            <li>I switched from Liggett&#x27;s original formula to the herbal about four months ago, because the herbal works better with our hard water.  </li>
            <li>For the first few weeks, I used a conditioner with it because it made my wet hair feel so sticky and clumpy that I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb it out.</li>
            <li>I also agree with another reviewer, this product gave my hair more body &amp; bounce than I&#x27;ve had before without using any other hair products.  </li>
            <li>This gave me MORE VOLUME THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT IVE EVER</li>
            <li>Not for normal hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural &amp; organic hair products, this one works very well!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pile it all up on top andscrub around, either, just let your hair hang down while you lather the roots.</li>
            <li>Plus, Liggett&#x27;s products contain no nasty ingredients - even better than expensive products like the Deva line - and I don&#x27;t have to toss or recycle any plastic containers.</li>
            <li>I can wash every *other* day, and as long as I keep my grubby little hands out of my hair, it still looks nice and clean for the full 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not difficult, it&#x27;s just different than most conventional shampoos in a bottle).</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I tried 2 of them and really can&#x27;t tell any difference - not even a fragrance which I like.</li>
            <li>I am looking for an all natural conditioner that really works.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are the same as the Original Formula and supposedly, this one smells different, but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>I like the earth friendly concentrated formula and minimal packaging.</li>
            <li>I live in Missouri.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s very soft and not at all tangled.</li>
            <li>would consider buying this shampoo bar again if it was about half the price, $7 can buy me a nice bottle of good quality natural shampoo that will last at least twice as long.  </li>
            <li>I tried it myself and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>left my hair feeling clean and even gives it some extra body.</li>
            <li>Since it allows me to wash less often, factoring in the additional cost savings on conditioner, hot water, and styling product, $6-7 for a 3.5 oz chunk of shampoo is actually dirt cheap, even for my waist-length wavy 2B</li>
            <li>Ingredients on this website: Olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, fresh pure new hampshire spring water, sodium hydroxide (a binder), rosemary-lavender-cedarwood and other essential oils for fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I switched brands last month and so far Liggett&#x27;s herbal shampoo bar appears to be working just as well as the pricey fancy pucks I&#x27;d been buying from a certain mall boutique.</li>
            <li>It did take a little extra care to make sure I got it rinsed out of my hair</li>
            <li>It does not strip the natural oils, yet cleans your hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>Old school.</li>
            <li>His hair is buzz cut, so he just rubs it directly onto his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bar shampoo is very drying so conditioner is necessary.</li>
            <li>I became a shampoo bar convert nearly two years ago.</li>
            <li>My scalp went wild with an allergic reaction to an ingredient.</li>
            <li>and I thought wow it works.</li>
            <li>The combo made my hair manageable and soft, but somewhat oily.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised by the sudsiness of this shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to leave it sitting out like solid incense...  </li>
            <li>(I can probably get use out of it for a couple more months at least).</li>
            <li>Even my occasional dandruff/itchy scalp is not as much of a problem anymore</li>
            <li>A classy, product.</li>
            <li>I bought several of these shampoo bars because they are economical and I wanted to try the different ingredients in each.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see why i would go back to liquid shampoos that have a short story worth of ingrediants.</li>
            <li>I use less products in my hair overall because I need less products, my hair looks good without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work, its great as a bar of soap but a night mare for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li>My husband has short shiny black hair and when he used the soap he didn&#x27;t (or wasn&#x27;t able to) rinse it out properly and some flakes fell off his head making him appear to have dandruff (which turned out to be soap on closer examination.)    </li>
            <li>this one i need to wash every day where as the original, i only need to wash every other day.</li>
            <li>I never felt like I could rinse out all of the soap properly without also using a regular shampoo, and consequently my hair looked kind of dull, sticky and frizzy even after trying to supplement with conditioner.</li>
            <li>Right after washing, your hair might feel a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or coarse, but once it begins to dry</li>
            <li>It does feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when you rinse it off when you first begin using it as other reviews have stated but this feeling goes away after a week or so of use.</li>
            <li>On first use, It made my hair feel so different that I was skeptical that I was going to be able to stick with using it.</li>
            <li>Rinses sqeaky clean and doesn&#x27;t waste plastic bottles!</li>
            <li>Feels stubborn like a squeaky clean, yet not squeaky clean, because it feels like there&#x27;s a minimal balance of my hair&#x27;s natural oils left behind?</li>
            <li>I  just wet my hair and  rub it gently a  couple times and</li>
            <li>Wow, arrived today &amp; before I got the carton open</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite all these concerns I still ordered three bars, the Herbal being one (I also ordered Peppermint and Jojoba and Tea Tree and Hemp oil, but so far I&#x27;ve only used the Herbal bar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely smell a difference in scent.</li>
            <li>I spent so much money over the years on fancy shampoo and conditioner and styling products.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so thick but never roughed up, it leaves the shaft smooth.</li>
            <li>I do still want to experiment with turning this into a liquid like I do with bar soap to see if I can get more uses and less waste.  </li>
            <li>, I usually rinse my hair in the tub before finishing in the shower and I had to scrub it out more thoroughly than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Found this for my husband to use when I started changing all of our personal products from commercial ones to natural, organic ones.  </li>
            <li>no tangles and no dry ends.</li>
            <li>The suds will drip down through the rest of it and cleanse it gently as you rinse.</li>
            <li>To anyone about to try this for the first time, it took about a week or week and a half to fully realize the benefits of using this shampoo, as i suppose my hair had to get used to being washed with such simple ingrediants.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been softer and the big deal is that it makes my hair fall smoother and not dry it out.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long and fine, though not too thin, with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>I have heavy, very straight and long hair, to the bottom of my ribs.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This soap was purchased for a traveling occasion as I&#x27;m attempting to perfect the one-bag packing technique while avoiding carrying liquids on the plane.</li>

            <li> Smells like a pleasantly nondescript cup of Celestial Seasonings.</li>

            <li> Its a good concept</li>
            <li> Good for hair though.</li>
            <li> but this works good,</li>
            <li> You need to learn to get a good lather on it</li>
            <li> We love them!</li>
            <li> I too do not need to use a separate conditioner on my hair, which is amazing, and it is easier to comb out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I really enjoyed the shampoo bar, it is made out of good quality ingredients and it cleaned my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice .</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Hair drys nice.</li>
            <li> foams up nicely when washing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product which doesn&#x27;t add more plastic to the landfills, it&#x27;s biodegradeable, sulfate free and my hair looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li> beautifully cleaned but not stripped of natural oils (which keep hair looking &amp; feeling great), and as a bonus, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very very light lavender smell.</li>
            <li> Like you bar so much better.  </li>
            <li> I am a retired hairdresser and I have never used a better shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I love the convenience of the bar.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> seems worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This also extends the life of your shampoo bar :)</li>
            <li> USED, more than mouse, hair spray, and blow drying.</li>
            <li> but I love this one.</li>
            <li> the top sources are wheat and soy.</li>
            <li> Love it, so now I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for more flavors.  </li>
            <li> Favorite formulation.</li>
            <li> I love them all.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Tea Tree formula to see if it makes even more of a difference there).</li>
            <li> I love shampoo bars, I don&#x27;t need conditioner</li>
            <li> I love the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> i thought this one would smell better.  </li>
            <li> It is low-cost, long-lasting, natural and is good for your hair!</li>
            <li> It prefer the rose scent of the original formula over this one, though.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my hair feels very clean.</li>
            <li> love how it smells and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker, has more body, and is easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> This gives me bouncy clean hair for 4 days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am happy to say that none of my concerns so far have been warranted.</li>
            <li> It is shiny and soft and has great texture.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers really nicely and best of all it rinses out very easily, so no standing under the shower head for five minutes trying to rinse out my hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the original version is better?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> i like the original better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different versions and have been happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li> It easily produces lots of lather and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Recommend strongly to all.</li>
            <li> I guess the best way to describe it was that I felt like I had slightly thicker, coarser hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it  suds up fine.</li>
            <li> I will continue to be a loyal customer and hope these shampoo bars are available for years to come!</li>
            <li> Apply in the shower after shampooing/rinse and rinse lightly.</li>
            <li> so i purchased this bar shampoo hoping it would be a good two in one for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> far as the shampoo itself, this is by far the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It lays just right and looks shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Each bar has unique properties so you can truly customize to your hair type.</li>
            <li> The original soap was recommended on a \\&quot;one-bag packing site\\&quot; and being into herbs</li>
            <li> Two quick swipes on my hair and the lather is tremendous!</li>
            <li> It rinses clean and is so easy to use,  more gentle than the baking soda.</li>
            <li> I love knowing exactly what&#x27;s going on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Gets your hair really clean</li>
            <li> After 3 washings I could feel a difference, squeeky clean improvement.</li>
            <li> Would it really clean my hair and get all the products out of it that I use, 3)</li>
            <li> my curly hair is curlier, more manageable, and generally looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> Our state does humidity like no one else, but it doesn&#x27;t do it in February, so this product hasn&#x27;t truly been put to the full test</li>
            <li> I loved the scent and the way it made my actual hair feel and look</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is most likely a more unique thing to some people but beware that it is a possiblity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The herbal scent is a bit strange, but pleasant still.</li>
            <li> But it did arrive quickly to my home.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Special stuff... love the old fashioned fragrance!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell a huge difference between this one and the Original Formula.</li>
            <li> My hair is squeaky clean after washing, and it&#x27;s generally better to not have to strip the natural oils from your hair.</li>
            <li> If you get free shipping this buy is worth it, but if not check your health food store first.</li>
            <li> It doubles as a body wash too, great for taking on trips, saves on space and cuts down on shower clutter!</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this product, but using it once was enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, easy and natural.</li>
            <li> First I need to state that I am an avid no-poo-er, sulfate free for 3 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> EASY five stars for this find - one of my favorite new-to-me product discoveries in a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one works just like their original formula, but with a very herb-y smell.</li>
            <li> This soap works very well and leaves my hair feeling clean and not stripped of</li>
            <li> The Original Formula is easier to find, and as far as the formulation, I see no difference between this one and the Original Formula.</li>
            <li> I am  becoming  Chemically sensitive</li>
            <li> Almost too clean, to the point that I really was hesitant to not use some conditioner the first time because my hair felt stripped out.</li>
            <li> hair feels wonderfully clean and doesn&#x27;t need an additional conditioner, since this bar doesn&#x27;t strip the natural (beneficial) oils, I LOVE the light &amp; fresh scent, and love how small a bar is compared to a bottle of regular shampoo, making it SUPER easy to pack for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, daily, on my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I was leary at the feeling after rinsing (it feels different than conditioned hair), but luckily I combed through it fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Great for if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> I have used this Ligget&#x27;s shampoo bar for years and really like it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this bar for a few weeks now (purchased locally,&lt;br /&gt;lower price) and couldn&#x27;t be more delighted and pleasantly surprised at what a fantastic product this is, what a terrific job it does on my hair - leaving it</li>
            <li> My hair feels cleaner, is more manageable and healthier since I made the switch from traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first bar shampoo i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I used a regular shampoo (Aveeno) and my hair was mostly okay again.</li>
            <li> At first it felt a bit oily, but after a short while (a couple of weeks at the most)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this quirky bar of shampoo a try!  </li>
            <li> My hair is a lot easier to work with and leave a pretty shine.</li>
            <li> Having a shampoo bar with a few ingredients is a good way to help.  </li>
            <li> But then I tried it on its own, without an extra conditioner, and WOW!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the other kind worked for me but not this one.</li>
            <li> They really are a friggin miracle for unforgivingly oily hair that needs to be washed daily (or more often).</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair has become so nice since I stopped dying it and using conventional hair products.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s pretty much my method.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen much progress compared to drugstore shampoos!</li>
            <li> I have used JR Liggetts bar shampoo in the past and had good results, but this herbal formula did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> I have short, colored, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This bar has a pretty decent weight &amp; density for its size.</li>
            <li> I also wish they had larger bars available as I think that would also help keep the bar from disappearing so fast.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and makes his scalp feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle shampoo or even really concerned with saving the planet</li>
            <li> I never knew my hair could have so much body.</li>
            <li> it has a very drying sticky consistency when you use it in the shower, but seems to leave my hair oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> How much it would lather without what I thought to be \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; ingredients, 2)</li>
            <li> Just make sure your hair is really wet, and I rub it on my scalp and the lather happens with the friction of the soap and my hair.</li>
            <li> I also notice you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as much with these bars.  </li>
            <li> Really like the soap.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling a bit less silky than a conventional or even an all natural liquid shampoo, but it looked nice and still felt nice.  </li>
            <li> I switched from Liggett&#x27;s original formula to the herbal about four months ago, because the herbal works better with our hard water.  </li>
            <li> For the first few weeks, I used a conditioner with it because it made my wet hair feel so sticky and clumpy that I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb it out.</li>
            <li> I also agree with another reviewer, this product gave my hair more body &amp; bounce than I&#x27;ve had before without using any other hair products.  </li>
            <li> This gave me MORE VOLUME THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT IVE EVER</li>
            <li> Not for normal hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural &amp; organic hair products, this one works very well!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pile it all up on top andscrub around, either, just let your hair hang down while you lather the roots.</li>
            <li> Plus, Liggett&#x27;s products contain no nasty ingredients - even better than expensive products like the Deva line - and I don&#x27;t have to toss or recycle any plastic containers.</li>
            <li> I can wash every *other* day, and as long as I keep my grubby little hands out of my hair, it still looks nice and clean for the full 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not difficult, it&#x27;s just different than most conventional shampoos in a bottle).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I tried 2 of them and really can&#x27;t tell any difference - not even a fragrance which I like.</li>
            <li> I am looking for an all natural conditioner that really works.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are the same as the Original Formula and supposedly, this one smells different, but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I like the earth friendly concentrated formula and minimal packaging.</li>
            <li> I live in Missouri.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s very soft and not at all tangled.</li>
            <li> would consider buying this shampoo bar again if it was about half the price, $7 can buy me a nice bottle of good quality natural shampoo that will last at least twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I tried it myself and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> left my hair feeling clean and even gives it some extra body.</li>
            <li> Since it allows me to wash less often, factoring in the additional cost savings on conditioner, hot water, and styling product, $6-7 for a 3.5 oz chunk of shampoo is actually dirt cheap, even for my waist-length wavy 2B</li>
            <li> Ingredients on this website: Olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, fresh pure new hampshire spring water, sodium hydroxide (a binder), rosemary-lavender-cedarwood and other essential oils for fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I switched brands last month and so far Liggett&#x27;s herbal shampoo bar appears to be working just as well as the pricey fancy pucks I&#x27;d been buying from a certain mall boutique.</li>
            <li> It did take a little extra care to make sure I got it rinsed out of my hair</li>
            <li> It does not strip the natural oils, yet cleans your hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> Old school.</li>
            <li> His hair is buzz cut, so he just rubs it directly onto his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bar shampoo is very drying so conditioner is necessary.</li>
            <li> I became a shampoo bar convert nearly two years ago.</li>
            <li> My scalp went wild with an allergic reaction to an ingredient.</li>
            <li> and I thought wow it works.</li>
            <li> The combo made my hair manageable and soft, but somewhat oily.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised by the sudsiness of this shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to leave it sitting out like solid incense...  </li>
            <li> (I can probably get use out of it for a couple more months at least).</li>
            <li> Even my occasional dandruff/itchy scalp is not as much of a problem anymore</li>
            <li> A classy, product.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these shampoo bars because they are economical and I wanted to try the different ingredients in each.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see why i would go back to liquid shampoos that have a short story worth of ingrediants.</li>
            <li> I use less products in my hair overall because I need less products, my hair looks good without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work, its great as a bar of soap but a night mare for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has short shiny black hair and when he used the soap he didn&#x27;t (or wasn&#x27;t able to) rinse it out properly and some flakes fell off his head making him appear to have dandruff (which turned out to be soap on closer examination.)    </li>
            <li> this one i need to wash every day where as the original, i only need to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> I never felt like I could rinse out all of the soap properly without also using a regular shampoo, and consequently my hair looked kind of dull, sticky and frizzy even after trying to supplement with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Right after washing, your hair might feel a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or coarse, but once it begins to dry</li>
            <li> It does feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when you rinse it off when you first begin using it as other reviews have stated but this feeling goes away after a week or so of use.</li>
            <li> On first use, It made my hair feel so different that I was skeptical that I was going to be able to stick with using it.</li>
            <li> Rinses sqeaky clean and doesn&#x27;t waste plastic bottles!</li>
            <li> Feels stubborn like a squeaky clean, yet not squeaky clean, because it feels like there&#x27;s a minimal balance of my hair&#x27;s natural oils left behind?</li>
            <li> I  just wet my hair and  rub it gently a  couple times and</li>
            <li> Wow, arrived today &amp; before I got the carton open</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite all these concerns I still ordered three bars, the Herbal being one (I also ordered Peppermint and Jojoba and Tea Tree and Hemp oil, but so far I&#x27;ve only used the Herbal bar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely smell a difference in scent.</li>
            <li> I spent so much money over the years on fancy shampoo and conditioner and styling products.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so thick but never roughed up, it leaves the shaft smooth.</li>
            <li> I do still want to experiment with turning this into a liquid like I do with bar soap to see if I can get more uses and less waste.  </li>
            <li> , I usually rinse my hair in the tub before finishing in the shower and I had to scrub it out more thoroughly than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Found this for my husband to use when I started changing all of our personal products from commercial ones to natural, organic ones.  </li>
            <li> no tangles and no dry ends.</li>
            <li> The suds will drip down through the rest of it and cleanse it gently as you rinse.</li>
            <li> To anyone about to try this for the first time, it took about a week or week and a half to fully realize the benefits of using this shampoo, as i suppose my hair had to get used to being washed with such simple ingrediants.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer and the big deal is that it makes my hair fall smoother and not dry it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long and fine, though not too thin, with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, very straight and long hair, to the bottom of my ribs.</li>
            <li> I have fine somewhat thick hair and after two uses this bar had my hair extremely oily like it hand been washed in days..</li>
            <li> I have used conditioning detangler after this shampoo, and I&#x27;ve also went without using any products to see what would happen, and both times my hair was soft (not dry), manageable, and got less oily over time compared to using regular liquid shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will definitely want to keep the bar someplace where it can drain well and dry completely between uses, so it will stay hard and last much longer.</li>
            <li> I think the only way to keep this bar in use for over a month is to thoroughly dry it after each use, it literally was smaller  between the time I left the shower and the time I got back in the shower the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really hoping my hair would be a little softer but it still looks dull and it doesn&#x27;t really cleanse my scalp of any oil/dandruff buildup..</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it seems to work just fine, though other customers with long hair have complained that it is a &amp;#34;nightmare&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> How long would it last, 4)</li>
            <li> One of my New Year&#x27;s resolutions this year was to try to pare down my personal care products, and put as few chemicals on my body as possible.</li>
            <li> As long as it can drain/dry</li>
            <li> Then again I don&#x27;t wash everyday so the natural oils help moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> There really is no residue left from it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long wavy hair almost to her waist.  </li>
            <li> have not yet tried the other varieties of this shampoo bar, but definitely will be trying them as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe, but fresh and green is a close description.</li>
            <li> I wash and let it air dry then comb it.</li>
            <li> I went to bed with with hair, and woke up to softer and seemingly fuller dry hair.</li>
            <li> Would it dry out my hair and leave it tangled</li>
            <li> My husband says this variety is more irritating if he gets it in his eyes than the other formulas so if you have small children that may be a factor for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made from all natural ingredients &amp; is 100% biodegradable, as well as having a small paper wrapper instead of bulky plastic to fill up garbage &amp; landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After getting that process down, now my 4 day hair seems like second day hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too, this doesn&#x27;t disintegrate or soften to mush like other shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> I went from washing my hair every other day with a conventional shampoo to twice a week with this shampoo bar, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel gross by wash day.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it in the stores where I live!</li>
            <li> I also figured other users were overusing the bar and that was why it was used up so quickly, but again I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> My typical nopoo will give me clean hair for 3 days(the third day being a bit dirty toward the evening).</li>
            <li> My hair felt as though the soap had left a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> b careful not to leave this thing wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Herbal bar for a few weeks now, washing my hair every 2-3 days, and have only just started to make a dent in it</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair and it cleansed it thoroughly without weighing it down or stripping it.  </li>

            <li> I have short, colored, fine hair.  I switched from Liggett&#x27;s original formula to the herbal about four months ago, because the herbal works better with our hard water.  It&#x27;s a great product which doesn&#x27;t add more plastic to the landfills, it&#x27;s biodegradeable, sulfate free and my hair looks very healthy.  After about a week or week and a half I find that I do get a little bit of build up, but I just keep a spray bottle of vinegar in the shower and that takes care of that.  My only real complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it in the stores where I live!</li>
            <li> I was using a different shampoo bar from another mfg. but foubnd out it had several different chemicals in it, very similar to comercial shampoos.  Like you bar so much better.  Very good pproduct without the added chemicals...it truly is &amp;#34;NATURAL&amp;#34; will order it again.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these shampoo bars because they are economical and I wanted to try the different ingredients in each.&lt;br /&gt;So far I tried 2 of them and really can&#x27;t tell any difference - not even a fragrance which I like. Each bar has unique properties so you can truly customize to your hair type.</li>
            <li> I have used this Ligget&#x27;s shampoo bar for years and really like it! It is low-cost, long-lasting, natural and is good for your hair! It does not strip the natural oils, yet cleans your hair. It is very gentle and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> This soap was purchased for a traveling occasion as I&#x27;m attempting to perfect the one-bag packing technique while avoiding carrying liquids on the plane. The original soap was recommended on a \\&quot;one-bag packing site\\&quot; and being into herbs I went with the herbal version.     My hair is pretty long and fine, though not too thin, with a slight wave. It does have a tendency to get frizzy if I don&#x27;t condition it properly. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I never felt like I could rinse out all of the soap properly without also using a regular shampoo, and consequently my hair looked kind of dull, sticky and frizzy even after trying to supplement with conditioner. It also didn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping considering the ingredient list.    My husband has short shiny black hair and when he used the soap he didn&#x27;t (or wasn&#x27;t able to) rinse it out properly and some flakes fell off his head making him appear to have dandruff (which turned out to be soap on closer examination.)    Perhaps the original version is better? I&#x27;m hesitant now to try it though, and am going to try Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Rosemary Mint shampoo bar next and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Its a good concept but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work, its great as a bar of soap but a night mare for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Reading the ingredients list, you&#x27;d think this shampoo would be great.  But it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It dries out your hair, and leaves it a tangled mangled mess. And as the previous reviewer said, it leaves your hair \\&quot;dull\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I use a TON of hair products, and let me tell you, this one is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;Under no circumstances would I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely oily. I have fine somewhat thick hair and after two uses this bar had my hair extremely oily like it hand been washed in days.. definitely will not be purchasing again~</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that said it was small, but I figured they were just comparing it to the price, nope, this is a tiny bar of soap. The bar is about 1.5 inches x .75 inches x 3 inches.  I also figured other users were overusing the bar and that was why it was used up so quickly, but again I was wrong.  I think the only way to keep this bar in use for over a month is to thoroughly dry it after each use, it literally was smaller  between the time I left the shower and the time I got back in the shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I really enjoyed the shampoo bar, it is made out of good quality ingredients and it cleaned my hair nicely.  It did take a little extra care to make sure I got it rinsed out of my hair, I usually rinse my hair in the tub before finishing in the shower and I had to scrub it out more thoroughly than other shampoos.  It did leave my hair feeling a bit less silky than a conventional or even an all natural liquid shampoo, but it looked nice and still felt nice.  I guess the best way to describe it was that I felt like I had slightly thicker, coarser hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I would consider buying this shampoo bar again if it was about half the price, $7 can buy me a nice bottle of good quality natural shampoo that will last at least twice as long.  I do still want to experiment with turning this into a liquid like I do with bar soap to see if I can get more uses and less waste.  If I do that I will amend this review with my results.  I also wish they had larger bars available as I think that would also help keep the bar from disappearing so fast.</li>
            <li> It smells divine.  Works great, daily, on my short hair.  Rinses sqeaky clean and doesn&#x27;t waste plastic bottles!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try solid shampoo, and bought two different brands to compare. I liked the smell of this product, but using it once was enough. My hair felt as though the soap had left a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> This soap works very well and leaves my hair feeling clean and not stripped of it&#x27;s natural oils. I would recommend it to anyone trying to get away from nasty chemical shampoos. I use it with a vinegar rinse (as conditioner) and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this bar for a few weeks now (purchased locally,&lt;br /&gt;lower price) and couldn&#x27;t be more delighted and pleasantly surprised at what a fantastic product this is, what a terrific job it does on my hair - leaving it beautifully cleaned but not stripped of natural oils (which keep hair looking &amp; feeling great), and as a bonus, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels wonderfully clean and doesn&#x27;t need an additional conditioner, since this bar doesn&#x27;t strip the natural (beneficial) oils, I LOVE the light &amp; fresh scent, and love how small a bar is compared to a bottle of regular shampoo, making it SUPER easy to pack for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made from all natural ingredients &amp; is 100% biodegradable, as well as having a small paper wrapper instead of bulky plastic to fill up garbage &amp; landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried the other varieties of this shampoo bar, but definitely will be trying them as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An EASY five stars for this find - one of my favorite new-to-me product discoveries in a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely want to keep the bar someplace where it can drain well and dry completely between uses, so it will stay hard and last much longer.</li>
            <li> This was good for my hair but awful and burned&lt;br /&gt;My skin and face and eyes. Yikes ! Good for hair though. Smells nice . Old school.</li>
            <li> I am a retired hairdresser and I have never used a better shampoo.  It lathers great and it leaves the hair feeling like you have&lt;br /&gt;conditioned it but not oily.  Gets your hair really clean and I love the convenience of the bar. That&#x27;s nice. 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Found this for my husband to use when I started changing all of our personal products from commercial ones to natural, organic ones.  He loves it!  It lathers very well and makes his scalp feel cleaner.  His hair is buzz cut, so he just rubs it directly onto his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I tried it myself and was pleasantly surprised!  I have long, curly hair and it cleansed it thoroughly without weighing it down or stripping it.  The bar lasts a long time too, doesn&#x27;t melt down in the shower!  The trick to using it is to rub it between your hands and build up the lather and then work that into your hair, if you have lengthy hair that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also agree with another reviewer, this product gave my hair more body &amp; bounce than I&#x27;ve had before without using any other hair products.  I too do not need to use a separate conditioner on my hair, which is amazing, and it is easier to comb out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural &amp; organic hair products, this one works very well!  It doubles as a body wash too, great for taking on trips, saves on space and cuts down on shower clutter!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I will use!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar. It&#x27;s clean, easy and natural. My hair feels cleaner, is more manageable and healthier since I made the switch from traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am  becoming  Chemically sensitive and I have lots of  allergies.I bought two of  Liggetts bars and like them. My hair stays cleaner longer and I don&#x27;t get itchy scalp or  greasy scalp when I was using  fancy bottled shampoo&#x27;s and  conditioners. I  just wet my hair and  rub it gently a  couple times and it  suds up fine. Hair drys nice.</li>
            <li> This bar lasts forever! Two quick swipes on my hair and the lather is tremendous! I am looking for an all natural conditioner that really works. Not vinegar! It doesn&#x27;t! This bar shampoo is very drying so conditioner is necessary. Other than that it meets all my expectations!</li>
            <li> I became a shampoo bar convert nearly two years ago. They really are a friggin miracle for unforgivingly oily hair that needs to be washed daily (or more often). I switched brands last month and so far Liggett&#x27;s herbal shampoo bar appears to be working just as well as the pricey fancy pucks I&#x27;d been buying from a certain mall boutique. I can wash every *other* day, and as long as I keep my grubby little hands out of my hair, it still looks nice and clean for the full 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;herbal formula&amp;#34; is rosemary, lavender, and cedarwood essential oils. Not obvious in this combination, but not overwhelming either. Smells like a pleasantly nondescript cup of Celestial Seasonings. The rest is the usual saponified vegetable oils and spring water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost seems worthwhile. This bar has a pretty decent weight &amp; density for its size. As long as it can drain/dry (common sense, y&#x27;all - any bar soap will melt into goo if left in water), it&#x27;ll last a couple months at least. Since it allows me to wash less often, factoring in the additional cost savings on conditioner, hot water, and styling product, $6-7 for a 3.5 oz chunk of shampoo is actually dirt cheap, even for my waist-length wavy 2B hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yet still only four stars? I live in Missouri. Our state does humidity like no one else, but it doesn&#x27;t do it in February, so this product hasn&#x27;t truly been put to the full test yet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That weird feel other reviewers mention Liggett shampoos leaving on wet hair: for me it&#x27;s no big deal. Feels stubborn like a squeaky clean, yet not squeaky clean, because it feels like there&#x27;s a minimal balance of my hair&#x27;s natural oils left behind? I dunno. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a residue, anyway, and doesn&#x27;t linger as hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP* If this bar is giving iffy results or bad tangles, try shampooing/lathering just your scalp. Depending on hair type, chances are that&#x27;s the only area that needs serious attention anyway. Don&#x27;t pile it all up on top andscrub around, either, just let your hair hang down while you lather the roots. The suds will drip down through the rest of it and cleanse it gently as you rinse. This also extends the life of your shampoo bar :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Since I switched to bar shampoo, that&#x27;s pretty much my method. Wide-tooth-comb conditioner through from nape to ends, leave it in while I shampoo my roots/scalp, then rinse everything out at the same time. This has cut way down on tangles and cumulative damage.)</li>
            <li> This is the first bar shampoo i&#x27;ve used and I can&#x27;t see why i would go back to liquid shampoos that have a short story worth of ingrediants. My hair has never been softer and the big deal is that it makes my hair fall smoother and not dry it out. I&#x27;m usually plauged with puffy hair once my hair dries after a shower but not anymore. To anyone about to try this for the first time, it took about a week or week and a half to fully realize the benefits of using this shampoo, as i suppose my hair had to get used to being washed with such simple ingrediants. also, this herbal one smells great.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both been using these bars for months. We love them! I occasionally get some buildup if my softener isn&#x27;t  working well because we have very hard water. My husband says this variety is more irritating if he gets it in his eyes than the other formulas so if you have small children that may be a factor for you. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> great idea. love how it smells and its easy to use. foams up nicely when washing.  b careful not to leave this thing wet. it will melt away faster than a snowman in june.</li>
            <li> I have used JR Liggetts bar shampoo in the past and had good results, but this herbal formula did not work out for me. After using it, my hair became dull, tangled (even when using conditioner) and started to break. I don&#x27;t know why the other kind worked for me but not this one. I used a regular shampoo (Aveeno) and my hair was mostly okay again. I&#x27;ll just use the remainder of this as a body wash.</li>
            <li> First I need to state that I am an avid no-poo-er, sulfate free for 3 years. I usually wash with baking soda solution . My typical nopoo will give me clean hair for 3 days(the third day being a bit dirty toward the evening). This gives me bouncy clean hair for 4 days! Yet it is not drying. I don&#x27;t need to condition or use oils in my hair with it either, no tangles and no dry ends. Then again I don&#x27;t wash everyday so the natural oils help moisturize my hair. It rinses clean and is so easy to use,  more gentle than the baking soda. There really is no residue left from it. It lasts a long time too, this doesn&#x27;t disintegrate or soften to mush like other shampoo bars. It has a very very light lavender smell. I have heavy, very straight and long hair, to the bottom of my ribs. This gave me MORE VOLUME THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT IVE EVER USED, more than mouse, hair spray, and blow drying. The herbal  formula contains lavender, rosemary and cedarwood oils which all promote thicker longer hair. I have not tried other formulas yet so I can&#x27;t vouch for those but I love this one. I wash and let it air dry then comb it. My hair feels so thick but never roughed up, it leaves the shaft smooth. I bought this at a health food store not from amazon, it cost me 6.49. If you get free shipping this buy is worth it, but if not check your health food store first.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent and the way it made my actual hair feel and look BUT oh no! My scalp went wild with an allergic reaction to an ingredient. Not sure which one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is most likely a more unique thing to some people but beware that it is a possiblity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiddle sticks! If only I hadn&#x27;t had it happen.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle shampoo or even really concerned with saving the planet but this works good, left my hair feeling clean and even gives it some extra body. It does feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when you rinse it off when you first begin using it as other reviews have stated but this feeling goes away after a week or so of use.</li>
            <li> Ingredients on this website: Olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, fresh pure new hampshire spring water, sodium hydroxide (a binder), rosemary-lavender-cedarwood and other essential oils for fragrance.  Ingredients on the one I received: Saponified Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Sunflower Oil, and Organic Palm Kernel Oil, Vit. E  The formula seems to have changed.  I contacted the company as to the source of Vit E.,as the top sources are wheat and soy. The company responded quickly--the source for Vit E is rapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> My scalp took a little time getting used to this shampoo. At first it felt a bit oily, but after a short while (a couple of weeks at the most) it balanced out. Right after washing, your hair might feel a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or coarse, but once it begins to dry I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s very soft and not at all tangled. I&#x27;ve found that since I started using bar shampoo my curly hair is curlier, more manageable, and generally looks and feels better. Plus, Liggett&#x27;s products contain no nasty ingredients - even better than expensive products like the Deva line - and I don&#x27;t have to toss or recycle any plastic containers. Big bonus.</li>
            <li> I have been using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars exclusively for over two years now, and have made a point of trying every one of their different formulas. This one works just like their original formula, but with a very herb-y smell. It is hard to describe, but fresh and green is a close description. It prefer the rose scent of the original formula over this one, though. The herbal scent is a bit strange, but pleasant still.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this quirky bar of shampoo a try!  It was weird at first rubbing the bar around my hair (very long hair), but then it started lathering up and I thought wow it works. Then I was leary at the feeling after rinsing (it feels different than conditioned hair), but luckily I combed through it fairly easily. I went to bed with with hair, and woke up to softer and seemingly fuller dry hair. Love it, so now I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for more flavors.  What a great find!</li>
            <li> Favorite formulation. Great for if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> One of my New Year&#x27;s resolutions this year was to try to pare down my personal care products, and put as few chemicals on my body as possible. To that end, I decided to try this shampoo bar, with its short list of ingredients. On first use, It made my hair feel so different that I was skeptical that I was going to be able to stick with using it. For the first few weeks, I used a conditioner with it because it made my wet hair feel so sticky and clumpy that I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb it out. The combo made my hair manageable and soft, but somewhat oily. But then I tried it on its own, without an extra conditioner, and WOW! I never knew my hair could have so much body. It lays just right and looks shiny and healthy.  AND it combs out just fine,,with few tangles. I&#x27;m sold... No more liquid shampoo for me!</li>
            <li> Happily surprised by the sudsiness of this shampoo bar.  After 3 washings I could feel a difference, squeeky clean improvement.</li>
            <li> Put off ordering because of price... Wow, arrived today &amp; before I got the carton open I could smell the wonderful Herbal  (rosemary, lavender, cedarwood) fragrance.  I was ready to leave it sitting out like solid incense...  Special stuff... love the old fashioned fragrance! and label.</li>
            <li> I have bought this shampoo for my daughter. She has allergy  for  liquid shampoo.  and this shampoo is very nice for her.</li>
            <li> Read my review to this shampoo on a different formulas. I love them all. Recommend strongly to all.</li>
            <li> i was trying to simplify my hygiene routine so i purchased this bar shampoo hoping it would be a good two in one for my naturally curly hair. i was definitely wrong. it has a very drying sticky consistency when you use it in the shower, but seems to leave my hair oily afterwards. i will not be using or purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I was a little worried about some things before I tried it: 1) How much it would lather without what I thought to be \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; ingredients, 2) Would it really clean my hair and get all the products out of it that I use, 3) How long would it last, 4) Would it dry out my hair and leave it tangled OR would it leave my hair sticky/oily/not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all these concerns I still ordered three bars, the Herbal being one (I also ordered Peppermint and Jojoba and Tea Tree and Hemp oil, but so far I&#x27;ve only used the Herbal bar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that none of my concerns so far have been warranted. I&#x27;ve used the Herbal bar for a few weeks now, washing my hair every 2-3 days, and have only just started to make a dent in it (I can probably get use out of it for a couple more months at least). My hair is not short either, it is past my shoulders. The shampoo lathers really nicely and best of all it rinses out very easily, so no standing under the shower head for five minutes trying to rinse out my hair. After rinsing, my hair feels very clean. Almost too clean, to the point that I really was hesitant to not use some conditioner the first time because my hair felt stripped out. But I went without conditioner just to see what would happen. I have used conditioning detangler after this shampoo, and I&#x27;ve also went without using any products to see what would happen, and both times my hair was soft (not dry), manageable, and got less oily over time compared to using regular liquid shampoos and conditioners. Even my occasional dandruff/itchy scalp is not as much of a problem anymore (I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Tea Tree formula to see if it makes even more of a difference there). I use less products in my hair overall because I need less products, my hair looks good without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to be a loyal customer and hope these shampoo bars are available for years to come!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen much progress compared to drugstore shampoos! I was really hoping my hair would be a little softer but it still looks dull and it doesn&#x27;t really cleanse my scalp of any oil/dandruff buildup.. Would not purchase this again.. really wish it worked for me :(</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Herbal Formula a try since I like different scented shampoos. Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell a huge difference between this one and the Original Formula. The Original Formula is easier to find, and as far as the formulation, I see no difference between this one and the Original Formula. I barely smell a difference in scent. The main ingredients are the same as the Original Formula and supposedly, this one smells different, but I really can&#x27;t tell. I can&#x27;t knock it any stars for the scent, because I find the scent of either formula is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shampoo itself, this is by far the best shampoo that I have ever used. It&#x27;s a slight learning curve. You need to learn to get a good lather on it (it&#x27;s not difficult, it&#x27;s just different than most conventional shampoos in a bottle). It&#x27;s worth it. Just make sure your hair is really wet, and I rub it on my scalp and the lather happens with the friction of the soap and my hair. After getting that process down, now my 4 day hair seems like second day hair. I went from washing my hair every other day with a conventional shampoo to twice a week with this shampoo bar, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel gross by wash day. My hair is squeaky clean after washing, and it&#x27;s generally better to not have to strip the natural oils from your hair. Bonus: I also use it as a body soap at the gym, so no need to lug a bunch of bottles when I go to the shower. So convenient!</li>
            <li> JR Liggett Bar Shampoo made my hair greasy. It was awful and I had to rewash right after drying. I did not like it at all and would not buy again. The bar is really tiny too, the picture makes it look larger. Not for normal hair!</li>
            <li> I love shampoo bars, I don&#x27;t need conditioner and I feel like I am not bathing in chemicals.  I have been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals my family is exposed to.  Having a shampoo bar with a few ingredients is a good way to help.  I also have a shower filter on my shower, so that also helps the shampoo bar perform. I love the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.  I have tried many different versions and have been happy with all of them.  I also notice you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as much with these bars.  The texture of my hair has become so nice since I stopped dying it and using conventional hair products.  I spent so much money over the years on fancy shampoo and conditioner and styling products.  I could probably have a small fortune now.  My hair looks better than it has in years.  It is shiny and soft and has great texture.  My daughter has long wavy hair almost to her waist.  I can comb her hair with no conditioner after using this bar.  She loves it because it is one step.  It is also great for travel.</li>
            <li> Really like the soap. My hair is a lot easier to work with and leave a pretty shine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the soap yet.  But it did arrive quickly to my home.  I&#x27;m planning on making this my travel shampoo to save weight.  It is much lighter than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> i like the original better.  i thought this one would smell better.  also, it leaves my hair too oily.  it still cleans well.  this one i need to wash every day where as the original, i only need to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> A classy, product. Just wish it came in larger bars.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this shampoo bar</li>
            <li> I like the earth friendly concentrated formula and minimal packaging. It easily produces lots of lather and seems to do the job. I&#x27;m not too fussy or tuned into the nuances of hair products. I have long hair and it seems to work just fine, though other customers with long hair have complained that it is a &amp;#34;nightmare&amp;#34;. So, I guess your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> as advertised. takes some getting used to. scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> I tried some more expensive, similar products - but will return to Liggett&#x27;s.  I love knowing exactly what&#x27;s going on my hair.  It&#x27;s thicker, has more body, and is easy to comb through.  The shampoo does leave a different &#x27;feel&#x27; on your hair, that you will have to get used to.  I also recommend a vinegar rinse with it to remove build up, this what I find works:  One part apple cider vinegar and 4+ parts water.  Apply in the shower after shampooing/rinse and rinse lightly.</li>
