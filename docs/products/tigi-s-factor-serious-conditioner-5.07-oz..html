            <li>glad I found it online!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real huge difference in the texture or body of my hair</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, like strawberries and cream.</li>
            <li>My hair had never been able to go more than two days without being washed and still look as good as the day I styled it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair super silky and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love, Love,  Love this product!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, curly, detangled, and easy to style and best yet, conquers the dryness!  </li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not in love with the smell, but I tend to like more fruity smelling things.</li>
            <li>but this product is definitely healthy.  </li>
            <li>So glad I can afford to buy it now.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested this to me as a deep conditioner that leaves your hair feeling great!</li>
            <li>I love the way it detangles my hair, and how it feels.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair healthy and shiny and can be used for shave cream too.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, but love Wen&#x27;s Re-moist better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others like Redken Rich Recovery, Brocato Cloud 9, Kerastase (prob my second fave), but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>creates a healthy, smooth shine.</li>
            <li>When you rinse it out, it leaves your hair feeling smooth, tangle-free and, most importantly, moisturized.</li>
            <li>I highlight my hair so at times it can get a bit dry, but this product works brilliantly.</li>
            <li>and I find it helps smooth out my curls.  </li>
            <li>S factor is one of my favorite deep conditioners and it smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>but I think this does just as good, half the price, and love the smell better.</li>
            <li>but I defintely thing they&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li>Which is great for your hair because it allows the natural oils to build up and make your hair much healthier over time.</li>
            <li>Best product ever, ships in exactly the container you see, I cut it open when it&#x27;s empty and scoop out all the last parts of it because it&#x27;s the best conditioner in the world.  </li>
            <li>My hair is completely straight and this product makes it look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>S Factor&#x27;s Serious Conditioner is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for my 3B curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Something to plump up fine hair pretty well if you have a layered look is Paul Mitchell Root Lifter and Thicken up.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this conditioner because I love S Factor products.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I can&#x27;t say it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>However, this combination allowed me to go nearly a week still looking shiny, healthy, and fresh (unless you have a workout regimen that causes the sweat to really drench your hair).</li>
            <li>so I use this conditioner 2-3 times a week to keep my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Really thick great stuff</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner on a regular basis  as I love the S Factor Products.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This was a much better price and was exactly the same product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous conditioner for my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Bumble and Bumble deep conditioner and love that one</li>
            <li>Love this product - leaves your hair de-frizzy but not greasy or flat!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this stuff and its worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>and  all were positive.</li>
            <li>But then again, I&#x27;m a huge fan of S-factor products in general.  </li>
            <li>and I must say, it&#x27;d the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Ive gotten fakes before, but this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li>I especially look forward to scent; it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, got her before date</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was any more conditioned than when using any other conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Truly remarkable hair treatment that transforms thin lifeless hair into silky stylable hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works well on long fine normal hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They tend to be a little bit more pricey side of the cost spectrum</li>
            <li>GREAT but went to wrong address.</li>
            <li>I normally shampoo with whatever I have on hand and then apply this once a week.</li>
            <li>With this combo you have a nice layer of conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down if you only use a drop.</li>
            <li>It melts into your hair and you will notice an instant difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>product completely saved my hair!</li>
            <li>It has also completely gotten rid of all my frizz!</li>
            <li>My hair had so much damage from dye jobs and constant heat</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s shine and bounce came back after using the whole tube.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to those with damaged hair</li>
            <li>I will update after more usage, I intend on using it at least once a week, maybe twice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After you shampoo, massage small amount in your hair, leave on 1-3 minutes and rinse hair very lightly with cool (not hot) water, towel dry, and then style and your hair will feel like silk - not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband used to work for a beaty supply distributor and after sampling dozens of products out there I found that a combination of this product along with Catwalk (Curls Rock, Curl Amplifier), and Redken Heatglide was a home run for a blow dry and straight iron combination.</li>
            <li>I recently went plantinum blonde and I am very concerned that my hair not look all fried out on its ends</li>
            <li>Large pink circle scratches off with finger nail but when bought from salon, it doesn&#x27;t scratch off.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a long time and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is thick and rich.</li>

            <li> The price, somewhat on the high side, not a cheap product</li>
            <li> I wash my colored hair daily (I work out daily), so my hair gets dry if untreated.</li>
            <li> and/or flat iron your hair</li>
            <li> Makes flat ironing easier.</li>
            <li> Either way, this priduct works and my dry hair comes back to life</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works long term, but I used it this morning and my hair already feels much softer than it has.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used it for so long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long curly hair</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner and leave it in while I do other stuff.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on for 20 minutes and then blow dry</li>
            <li> I am hoping to strengthen my dry hair with this product.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair everyday, and only condition withe it once a week</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> This may dry your hair out after a while, though, if you do not condition it properly so using this conditioner as a treatment every few weeks works gloriously.    </li>
            <li> It seems to penetrate the hair and even my dry hair was shiny and not weighed down after blowing dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is to die for as well— it reminds me of pink lemonade</li>
            <li> I am careful about buying hair product</li>
            <li> It smells like yummy pink sugar and the conditioner is pink itself.</li>
            <li> Serious Conditioner leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And lastly, a styling product in Curl Amplifier that on thin hair actually plumps it up</li>
            <li> (if you just use one pump or even half a pump) and will keep your style locked in place (no flyaways, etc) without adversely interfering with the other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years, but could only find it for ridiculous prices at salons around me.</li>
            <li> Then a coat of heatglide providing shine to the max without making your hair greasy (if you just use a few pumps tops).</li>
            <li> Not too heavy</li>
            <li> so products have always been hard for me to use without making my hair look either too thin, too weighed down, too dry, or too greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the conditioner on and then put a plastic cap</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which means naturally dry/frizzy hair as well, especially bad in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> Just started using Serious S-Factor conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and this is seriously a miracle.</li>
            <li> I believe the product is a fake.</li>
            <li> Totally wrong product !</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this conditioner! As the title states, it is a miracle. I highlight my hair so at times it can get a bit dry, but this product works brilliantly. I normally shampoo with whatever I have on hand and then apply this once a week. I usually leave the conditioner on and then put a plastic cap and I will either sit in the sun for about 20 minutes or I will heat a damp towel and then wrap that over the cap. Either way, this priduct works and my dry hair comes back to life and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I see why the term &amp;#34;serious &amp;#34; was used on this product.  I did some research on reviews and  all were positive. Had to give it a try and I must say, it&#x27;d the real deal.  I need a larger size.  The price, somewhat on the high side, not a cheap product but sometimes u get what u pay for, right?  It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> S Factor&#x27;s Serious Conditioner is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for my 3B curly hair.  If you leave it on for 20 minutes and then blow dry and/or flat iron your hair, you will have the silkiest, softest hair ever.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  I recently went plantinum blonde and I am very concerned that my hair not look all fried out on its ends so I use this conditioner 2-3 times a week to keep my hair smooth and soft.  You only have to leave it in for about five minutes for it to do its thing.  But then again, I&#x27;m a huge fan of S-factor products in general.  They tend to be a little bit more pricey side of the cost spectrum but I defintely thing they&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> My husband used to work for a beaty supply distributor and after sampling dozens of products out there I found that a combination of this product along with Catwalk (Curls Rock, Curl Amplifier), and Redken Heatglide was a home run for a blow dry and straight iron combination. I have very, very fine hair so products have always been hard for me to use without making my hair look either too thin, too weighed down, too dry, or too greasy. My hair had never been able to go more than two days without being washed and still look as good as the day I styled it. However, this combination allowed me to go nearly a week still looking shiny, healthy, and fresh (unless you have a workout regimen that causes the sweat to really drench your hair). Which is great for your hair because it allows the natural oils to build up and make your hair much healthier over time. With this combo you have a nice layer of conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down if you only use a drop. Then a coat of heatglide providing shine to the max without making your hair greasy (if you just use a few pumps tops). And lastly, a styling product in Curl Amplifier that on thin hair actually plumps it up (if you just use one pump or even half a pump) and will keep your style locked in place (no flyaways, etc) without adversely interfering with the other products. All three of these should be applied to damp hair.     Something to plump up fine hair pretty well if you have a layered look is Paul Mitchell Root Lifter and Thicken up. This may dry your hair out after a while, though, if you do not condition it properly so using this conditioner as a treatment every few weeks works gloriously.    Happy hairdays!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve used others like Redken Rich Recovery, Brocato Cloud 9, Kerastase (prob my second fave), but this one is the best. It melts into your hair and you will notice an instant difference the first time you use it. Leaves your hair super silky and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> great conditioner!  The best I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Just started using Serious S-Factor conditioner.  My hair is coarse and I&#x27;m coloring it to cover gray.  This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Large pink circle scratches off with finger nail but when bought from salon, it doesn&#x27;t scratch off.  Eventually after use, all labels will come off.  I believe the product is a fake.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It is the best I have ever used. I flat iron my hair everyday, and only condition withe it once a week and my hair is in great condition!</li>
            <li> Best product for after color!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t but the one they try to sell you in the salon, this is it!</li>
            <li> Really thick great stuff, my go to if the weather is Humid, or If I am by the water or the beach. Not in love with the smell, but I tend to like more fruity smelling things.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner on a regular basis  as I love the S Factor Products.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any real huge difference in the texture or body of my hair but this product is definitely healthy.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used it for so long.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have very dry hair and this moisturizes my hair. I will continue to buy this product off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  My hair is completely straight and this product makes it look shiny and healthy.  Great smell too.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years, but could only find it for ridiculous prices at salons around me. This was a much better price and was exactly the same product. So glad I can afford to buy it now.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this to me as a deep conditioner that leaves your hair feeling great! Love this product - leaves your hair de-frizzy but not greasy or flat!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which means naturally dry/frizzy hair as well, especially bad in the summer time.  This conditioner gets me through the summer w/o chopping my hair off.  It leaves my hair soft, curly, detangled, and easy to style and best yet, conquers the dryness!  Nothing else I&#x27;ve found works as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love, Love,  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner and leave it in while I do other stuff. LOVE how this makes my hair feel! When you rinse it out, it leaves your hair feeling smooth, tangle-free and, most importantly, moisturized. The smell is to die for as well— it reminds me of pink lemonade/strawberries with a hint of mint. I would suggest buying the 25 oz because it&#x27;ll be gone in no time. Very impressed, everything arrived in order and on time.</li>
            <li> Totally wrong product !</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional for curly hair.  My hair is curly and it has been colored.  S factor Serious Conditioner leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and rich. It seems to penetrate the hair and even my dry hair was shiny and not weighed down after blowing dry.</li>
            <li> S factor is one of my favorite deep conditioners and it smells soooo good. I am careful about buying hair product online cause Ive gotten fakes before, but this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li> I once drove 4 hrs to purchase this item from a salon...glad I found it online! I love the way it detangles my hair, and how it feels. The smell is incredible. Definitely a class above the products I find on the store shelf or even any Paul Mitchell products I&#x27; ve tried.</li>
            <li> Truly remarkable hair treatment that transforms thin lifeless hair into silky stylable hair.&lt;br /&gt;After you shampoo, massage small amount in your hair, leave on 1-3 minutes and rinse hair very lightly with cool (not hot) water, towel dry, and then style and your hair will feel like silk - not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this product from my stylist about 4 years ago and I&#x27;ve been buying it online ever since and I even give it to close friends and family so they know about this &amp;#34;secret weapon&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li> My hair had so much damage from dye jobs and constant heat styling,&lt;br /&gt;this product completely saved my hair! My hair&#x27;s shine and bounce came back after using the whole tube.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to those with damaged hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely long curly hair and this is seriously a miracle. It smells amazing, like strawberries and cream. It has also completely gotten rid of all my frizz! LITERALLY NO FRIZZ! AHHH I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> best conditioner i&#x27;ve ever found. works well on long fine normal hair. creates a healthy, smooth shine.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff. Leaves your hair healthy and shiny and can be used for shave cream too. It smells like yummy pink sugar and the conditioner is pink itself. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, but love Wen&#x27;s Re-moist better. i leave it in overnight.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works long term, but I used it this morning and my hair already feels much softer than it has.  I am hoping to strengthen my dry hair with this product.  I will update after more usage, I intend on using it at least once a week, maybe twice.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner out there. Been using it for a long time and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioner for my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this years ago as a weekly or semi weekly treatment as needed between visits.  I absolutely love this stuff and have been using it for years.  Keeps my hair soft and healthy.  I love the smell of the conditioner.  My husband is always asking what I put in my hair after I use it.  I would highly recommend this stuff and its worth the price tag.  I&#x27;ve used the Bumble and Bumble deep conditioner and love that one as well but I think this does just as good, half the price, and love the smell better.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of conditioning. Not too heavy and I find it helps smooth out my curls.  Makes flat ironing easier.</li>
            <li> GREAT but went to wrong address.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this conditioner because I love S Factor products.  I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was any more conditioned than when using any other conditioner.  For the price, I can&#x27;t say it was worth it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wash my colored hair daily (I work out daily), so my hair gets dry if untreated. I use S Factor Sunflower Seed Oil once a week, and also after I color my hair or spend a day in the sun. I especially look forward to scent; it is fabulous. I have been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> Best product ever, ships in exactly the container you see, I cut it open when it&#x27;s empty and scoop out all the last parts of it because it&#x27;s the best conditioner in the world.  Fast shipping, got her before date and I would order from them again, and again, and again.</li>
