            <li>This is a great sunblock!  </li>
            <li>I think a seal over the bottle opening with the pump handle packaged separately would be ideal.</li>
            <li>Nothing harmful... works great.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen itself is great, but the spray is severe drawback.</li>

            <li>This is a good sunscreen from a cruelty-free company.  </li>
            <li>Good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself seems quite good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply to kids in spray bottle, but is not an aerosol, which is good!</li>
            <li>Used this product and had a very enjoyable vacation without any sunburn.</li>
            <li>We all love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this one!</li>
            <li>My first use of the pump though, I now know what others have experienced!</li>
            <li>The sunscreen itself is amazing though</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen as well as</li>
            <li>I like the smell, kind of pepperminty.  </li>
            <li>A nice lotion but</li>
            <li>This product smells alright and goes on like a good lotion,keeps me from getting burned and is petrolium free.</li>
            <li>Lovely product, smells great, very effective, leaves skin feeling soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Easy application for kids!</li>
            <li>Everyone in my house loves the consistency of this product,  Goes on easily!</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen lotion, but the cap/sprayer broke very fast.</li>
            <li>Safer ingredients, the spray works just fine!</li>
            <li>Very light and no greasy feeling after applying it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this Sunscreen, I found it easy to apply to mine and my kids skin with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>I liked the  quality of this product and is easy to apply on children.</li>
            <li>Smells good, cruelty free, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen; it goes on well and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I poured this sunscreen on my hand and rubbed it in grand kids</li>
            <li>Researched looking for best sunscreens, this was on several lists.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals here.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had much better luck with the Alba line of kids sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather not have a spray bottle than deal with the frustration of the top coming off in my hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this after having a baby and reading all of the reviews on the harmful chemicals in most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula</li>
            <li>use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact</li>
            <li>may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO.</li>
            <li>The spray is not as convenient as the aerosols but better than a squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing this</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power</li>
            <li>Love this product and bought many bottles but the sprayer trigger broke on ALL bottles.</li>
            <li>The should come up with better quality trigger.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be getting more-</li>
            <li>The smell is okay but doesn&#x27;t have that summer time smell</li>
            <li>I have reordered this many times.  </li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this</li>
            <li>and I feel safe putting it on my kids.</li>
            <li>This provides some protection, but it is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Now we have to unscrew the top to use it.</li>
            <li>did ok for walking around at the market etc.</li>
            <li>seemed like the &amp;#34;cheap-o&amp;#34; stuff our friends wore worked better?</li>
            <li>I just took the top of it off and used it as I would a bottle of non-spray sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If they could make the pumps more reliable, it would be outstanding.</li>
            <li>Just love it for my oily skin</li>
            <li>Warning: you must use a stronger and more reliable sunscreen than this one if you plan on being in the sun.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good sunscreen, it&#x27;s right in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Great natural sunscreen, nice spray, easily applicable.</li>
            <li>The product itself works great, however, 3 days into our vacation, the spraying function on the bottle broke, leave us to have to unscrew it and use it like normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It sprays out in a mist you can see and its super easy to rub in, which I love!</li>
            <li>Great price and came super fast!</li>
            <li>If chemicals are not disturbing to you, then roofing tar offers the best sunscreen on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li>love this sunscreen, but the bottles have always had issues and the sprayers don&#x27;t work after a while, so I decided to buy a large bottle and fill my own bottles with the contents.</li>
            <li>Great concept and the sunscreen is nice but our pump broke on e second day and now we have a bottle full of lotion with no working pump....</li>
            <li>Came back with a gorgeous tan!</li>
            <li>there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to spray.  </li>
            <li>The spray makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li>Lasts awhile and easy to pump.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to rinse off in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave greasy skin.</li>
            <li>but the scent is too strong for my daughter</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, feels great, and most importantly, we actually use it!</li>
            <li>The spray comes out kind of funny</li>
            <li>The lotion is quite nice; however, the spray bottle broke within the first 2 minutes of opening it.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenient sprayer which helps get this on quick and easily with squirming kids.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle broke very quickly after buying which was of course a huge pain.  </li>
            <li>lotion is light and has almost no scent.</li>
            <li>get it people say they have problems with bottle is a great price too for such a big&lt;br /&gt;bottle</li>
            <li>It has a light coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>When you spray it, you actually get a great amount of lotion.</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and makes getting 4 kids lathered up for the sun quick and easy.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>With this one I&#x27;ve been good so far.</li>
            <li>Worked really good for my sensitive, allergic child.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>originally purchased this for a Mexico vacation for a snorkel trip where they require biodegradable sunscreen.</li>
            <li>is nature friendly too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, we certainly want you to be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>But I love the product and the value of the large format.</li>
            <li>Kiss My Face, please make this right!</li>
            <li>That being said, I will give it one more try on the chance that I did not reapply as much as I should have.</li>
            <li>The only good things about this</li>
            <li>Even though the bottle is defective, the sunscreen is still a good alternative to traditional sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The trajectory of the spray sucks if this formula was in a squeeze bottle, it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t ask for more in any sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My family loved this sunscreen last year.</li>
            <li>no bad or toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy, rubs in clear even on very tan/dark skin and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild scent</li>
            <li>It has made it super sticky and I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane, alcohol.</li>
            <li>I bought this spray hoping it would be so quick and easy to put on that I would be more likely to do it.  </li>
            <li>Living in Hawaii we go through sun screen like water and thus stuff works well, is fairly priced, and not full of too many chemicals that will kill you later in life :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not talking clogged nozzles; the sprayer head just popped right off and cannot be reattached...on both bottles.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine if I&#x27;m spraying someone else, but if I have to use my left hand to spray myself, let&#x27;s say to get my right arm, the whole top seems to just come off.</li>
            <li>I opted to buy Alba Botanical Dry Oil to replace it and also noticed a huge difference in the protection it provided, as well as a much better spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Worked fine as far as sun protection goes.</li>
            <li>Whole point of having spray sunscreen is to add spray!</li>
            <li>If the company replaces the packaging I would be willing to try it again, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>My kids like this sunscreen above all the others I&#x27;ve tried that were rated 4 or better from ewg.com.  </li>
            <li>, I would use this for cooler weather rather than hot weather as although it does feel sticky and clammy when you first wear it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Kiss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two of these bottles and both spray tops broke within the first five sprays.</li>
            <li>I am willing to spend money on quality products but this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and not a greasy sunscreen either!</li>
            <li>I just started using this product more in the last week or so and already the pump/sprayer broke.</li>
            <li>Overall I really love &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li>This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have any of that, goes on easily, and comes at a much better price than all of the other natural sunscreens I researched.  </li>
            <li>Will will review later if sprayer is easily replaced.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason I buy it is because of how easy it is to apply and rub in.</li>
            <li>My Face product I&#x27;ve been less than thrilled with.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast but for how well it moisturize while protecting you from the sun, I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I just HOPE I received one of the older bottles and this was not the redesign!</li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t too much of an issue as this type of sunscreen needs to be rubbed on anyways.</li>
            <li>The pump with lotion makes putting this on squirmy kids so much easier - I don&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>but really, I don&#x27;t feel like this should be happening EVERY time I use it.</li>
            <li>, that is a whole world by itself.</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.</li>
            <li>The whole handle mechanism broke</li>
            <li>I really like that is</li>
            <li>We value your feedback and these comments are taken very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids got so much color</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land on your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it this year again, maybe it was expired so it was ineffective due to that.</li>
            <li>Decent smell with no irritating or breaking out.  </li>
            <li>For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear, no mess spray that goes on quickly and dries in seconds.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in quickly and does not leave a white residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>my face spf 50, which was a little better.  </li>
            <li>It is not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal on a less harsh sunscreen for the family.</li>
            <li>I love the sunscreen, it&#x27;s great, all of the sun protection but none of the bad stuff!</li>
            <li>I wrote the company and they sent me 3 new pumps which also broke.</li>
            <li>I bought this again this year (2015) and there is a new formula.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The first bottle broke on the third use.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time in Aruba in 50SPF, reapplied every 2 hours, and got 3rd degree burns on my skin.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>arrival ontime, we live in the snshine and this sunblock is natural and sprays perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li>Gave three starts because I would give old formula 5 stars and new formula 1.</li>
            <li>It went on easy and dried well.</li>
            <li>the sunscreen feels a bit on the thin side which slightly concerns me in terms of how long it is effective, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super oily like other sun screens and sprays on well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural, no oxybenzone, sunscreen in a larger size for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>My child has sensitive skin and the sunscreen does not bother him.</li>
            <li>Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen must be applied so frequently that it becomes cumbersome.</li>
            <li>up using it anyway, a real pain to unscrew what was left of the cap</li>
            <li>I have resorted to leaving the bottle on the counter and spraying the lotion into my hand rather than trying to spray directly onto my arms or legs.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>Even though I ended up not using it for that purpose, I still really like this sunscreen and ended up using it throughout my entire vacation.</li>
            <li>nearly 3/4 of the bottle is gone so maybe they fixed the issue with it breaking?</li>
            <li>only problem is that the spray mechanism on the bottle is absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen seems to be effective and non irritating, but it doesn&#x27;t spray on at all evenly.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is handy and mine hasn&#x27;t broken or given any problems (knock on wood).  </li>
            <li>But I spent a little extra for the spray top and it broke right away.</li>
            <li>While I do live in Florida, I generally spend minutes, rather than hours in the sun, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about how the lotion sprays out, but I knew what I was getting into when I read other reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sprayer hasn&#x27;t broken yet and the sunscreen goes on easily without requiring too much time to rub in.</li>
            <li>The pumper broke on third use with normal usage.  </li>
            <li>Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 1.70% and more unneeded ingredients.</li>
            <li>It would be a major pain for me to return</li>
            <li>The second time I purchased it, the bottle was a completely different shape than the first but same ounces</li>
            <li>All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>Once the pump is broken, the sunscreen looses its convenience and you go through much more of it.</li>
            <li>Sunblock is fine, but the spay top is terrible and consistently brakes or is inoperable.</li>
            <li>Spray cap broke within first few days of use.</li>
            <li>It drys to a soft powdery feel once dry.  </li>
            <li>The spray feature allows you to use what you need rather than the tubes where you usually end up using far too much in areas.</li>
            <li>I received an uneven tan and burn, despite applying the product evenly over my entire body and reapplying practically every hour the first two days.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>Also love the way this product feels compared to other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past this one is not very greasy.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other non toxic sunscreens, I have tried this rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick film on your skin.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> We went to Aruba for 2 weeks and from experience we fly thru SPF</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen,bad pump design</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very handy in a group setting at the pool</li>
            <li> Im very happy that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals most sunscreens have in them either.</li>
            <li> It works great and feels good on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All in all, it is good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good price, goes on well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I feel provided a good protection.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen from a cruelty-free company.  </li>
            <li> Good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself seems quite good.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply to kids in spray bottle, but is not an aerosol, which is good!</li>
            <li> Used this product and had a very enjoyable vacation without any sunburn.</li>
            <li> We all love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this one!</li>
            <li> My first use of the pump though, I now know what others have experienced!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself is amazing though</li>
            <li> make my own sunscreen as well as</li>
            <li> I like the smell, kind of pepperminty.  </li>
            <li> A nice lotion but</li>
            <li> This product smells alright and goes on like a good lotion,keeps me from getting burned and is petrolium free.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, smells great, very effective, leaves skin feeling soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Easy application for kids!</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house loves the consistency of this product,  Goes on easily!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen lotion, but the cap/sprayer broke very fast.</li>
            <li> Safer ingredients, the spray works just fine!</li>
            <li> Very light and no greasy feeling after applying it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Sunscreen, I found it easy to apply to mine and my kids skin with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I liked the  quality of this product and is easy to apply on children.</li>
            <li> Smells good, cruelty free, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen; it goes on well and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I poured this sunscreen on my hand and rubbed it in grand kids</li>
            <li> Researched looking for best sunscreens, this was on several lists.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals here.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had much better luck with the Alba line of kids sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather not have a spray bottle than deal with the frustration of the top coming off in my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having a baby and reading all of the reviews on the harmful chemicals in most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula</li>
            <li> use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact</li>
            <li> may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li> but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO.</li>
            <li> The spray is not as convenient as the aerosols but better than a squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love wearing this</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power</li>
            <li> Love this product and bought many bottles but the sprayer trigger broke on ALL bottles.</li>
            <li> The should come up with better quality trigger.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be getting more-</li>
            <li> The smell is okay but doesn&#x27;t have that summer time smell</li>
            <li> I have reordered this many times.  </li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this</li>
            <li> and I feel safe putting it on my kids.</li>
            <li> This provides some protection, but it is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Now we have to unscrew the top to use it.</li>
            <li> did ok for walking around at the market etc.</li>
            <li> seemed like the &amp;#34;cheap-o&amp;#34; stuff our friends wore worked better?</li>
            <li> I just took the top of it off and used it as I would a bottle of non-spray sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If they could make the pumps more reliable, it would be outstanding.</li>
            <li> Just love it for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Warning: you must use a stronger and more reliable sunscreen than this one if you plan on being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good sunscreen, it&#x27;s right in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen, nice spray, easily applicable.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, however, 3 days into our vacation, the spraying function on the bottle broke, leave us to have to unscrew it and use it like normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It sprays out in a mist you can see and its super easy to rub in, which I love!</li>
            <li> Great price and came super fast!</li>
            <li> If chemicals are not disturbing to you, then roofing tar offers the best sunscreen on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen, but the bottles have always had issues and the sprayers don&#x27;t work after a while, so I decided to buy a large bottle and fill my own bottles with the contents.</li>
            <li> Great concept and the sunscreen is nice but our pump broke on e second day and now we have a bottle full of lotion with no working pump....</li>
            <li> Came back with a gorgeous tan!</li>
            <li> there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to spray.  </li>
            <li> The spray makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li> Lasts awhile and easy to pump.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to rinse off in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave greasy skin.</li>
            <li> but the scent is too strong for my daughter</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, feels great, and most importantly, we actually use it!</li>
            <li> The spray comes out kind of funny</li>
            <li> The lotion is quite nice; however, the spray bottle broke within the first 2 minutes of opening it.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenient sprayer which helps get this on quick and easily with squirming kids.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle broke very quickly after buying which was of course a huge pain.  </li>
            <li> lotion is light and has almost no scent.</li>
            <li> get it people say they have problems with bottle is a great price too for such a big&lt;br /&gt;bottle</li>
            <li> It has a light coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> When you spray it, you actually get a great amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily and makes getting 4 kids lathered up for the sun quick and easy.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> With this one I&#x27;ve been good so far.</li>
            <li> Worked really good for my sensitive, allergic child.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> originally purchased this for a Mexico vacation for a snorkel trip where they require biodegradable sunscreen.</li>
            <li> is nature friendly too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, we certainly want you to be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> But I love the product and the value of the large format.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face, please make this right!</li>
            <li> That being said, I will give it one more try on the chance that I did not reapply as much as I should have.</li>
            <li> The only good things about this</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is defective, the sunscreen is still a good alternative to traditional sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The trajectory of the spray sucks if this formula was in a squeeze bottle, it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t ask for more in any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My family loved this sunscreen last year.</li>
            <li> no bad or toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy, rubs in clear even on very tan/dark skin and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild scent</li>
            <li> It has made it super sticky and I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane, alcohol.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray hoping it would be so quick and easy to put on that I would be more likely to do it.  </li>
            <li> Living in Hawaii we go through sun screen like water and thus stuff works well, is fairly priced, and not full of too many chemicals that will kill you later in life :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not talking clogged nozzles; the sprayer head just popped right off and cannot be reattached...on both bottles.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine if I&#x27;m spraying someone else, but if I have to use my left hand to spray myself, let&#x27;s say to get my right arm, the whole top seems to just come off.</li>
            <li> I opted to buy Alba Botanical Dry Oil to replace it and also noticed a huge difference in the protection it provided, as well as a much better spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as far as sun protection goes.</li>
            <li> Whole point of having spray sunscreen is to add spray!</li>
            <li> If the company replaces the packaging I would be willing to try it again, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My kids like this sunscreen above all the others I&#x27;ve tried that were rated 4 or better from ewg.com.  </li>
            <li> , I would use this for cooler weather rather than hot weather as although it does feel sticky and clammy when you first wear it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Kiss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these bottles and both spray tops broke within the first five sprays.</li>
            <li> I am willing to spend money on quality products but this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and not a greasy sunscreen either!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product more in the last week or so and already the pump/sprayer broke.</li>
            <li> Overall I really love &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have any of that, goes on easily, and comes at a much better price than all of the other natural sunscreens I researched.  </li>
            <li> Will will review later if sprayer is easily replaced.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I buy it is because of how easy it is to apply and rub in.</li>
            <li> My Face product I&#x27;ve been less than thrilled with.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast but for how well it moisturize while protecting you from the sun, I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I just HOPE I received one of the older bottles and this was not the redesign!</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t too much of an issue as this type of sunscreen needs to be rubbed on anyways.</li>
            <li> The pump with lotion makes putting this on squirmy kids so much easier - I don&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> but really, I don&#x27;t feel like this should be happening EVERY time I use it.</li>
            <li> , that is a whole world by itself.</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it.</li>
            <li> The whole handle mechanism broke</li>
            <li> I really like that is</li>
            <li> We value your feedback and these comments are taken very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids got so much color</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land on your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it this year again, maybe it was expired so it was ineffective due to that.</li>
            <li> Decent smell with no irritating or breaking out.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear, no mess spray that goes on quickly and dries in seconds.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in quickly and does not leave a white residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> my face spf 50, which was a little better.  </li>
            <li> It is not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal on a less harsh sunscreen for the family.</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen, it&#x27;s great, all of the sun protection but none of the bad stuff!</li>
            <li> I wrote the company and they sent me 3 new pumps which also broke.</li>
            <li> I bought this again this year (2015) and there is a new formula.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first bottle broke on the third use.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time in Aruba in 50SPF, reapplied every 2 hours, and got 3rd degree burns on my skin.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> arrival ontime, we live in the snshine and this sunblock is natural and sprays perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li> Gave three starts because I would give old formula 5 stars and new formula 1.</li>
            <li> It went on easy and dried well.</li>
            <li> the sunscreen feels a bit on the thin side which slightly concerns me in terms of how long it is effective, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super oily like other sun screens and sprays on well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, no oxybenzone, sunscreen in a larger size for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> My child has sensitive skin and the sunscreen does not bother him.</li>
            <li> Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen must be applied so frequently that it becomes cumbersome.</li>
            <li> up using it anyway, a real pain to unscrew what was left of the cap</li>
            <li> I have resorted to leaving the bottle on the counter and spraying the lotion into my hand rather than trying to spray directly onto my arms or legs.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Even though I ended up not using it for that purpose, I still really like this sunscreen and ended up using it throughout my entire vacation.</li>
            <li> nearly 3/4 of the bottle is gone so maybe they fixed the issue with it breaking?</li>
            <li> only problem is that the spray mechanism on the bottle is absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen seems to be effective and non irritating, but it doesn&#x27;t spray on at all evenly.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is handy and mine hasn&#x27;t broken or given any problems (knock on wood).  </li>
            <li> But I spent a little extra for the spray top and it broke right away.</li>
            <li> While I do live in Florida, I generally spend minutes, rather than hours in the sun, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about how the lotion sprays out, but I knew what I was getting into when I read other reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sprayer hasn&#x27;t broken yet and the sunscreen goes on easily without requiring too much time to rub in.</li>
            <li> The pumper broke on third use with normal usage.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 1.70% and more unneeded ingredients.</li>
            <li> It would be a major pain for me to return</li>
            <li> The second time I purchased it, the bottle was a completely different shape than the first but same ounces</li>
            <li> All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> Once the pump is broken, the sunscreen looses its convenience and you go through much more of it.</li>
            <li> Sunblock is fine, but the spay top is terrible and consistently brakes or is inoperable.</li>
            <li> Spray cap broke within first few days of use.</li>
            <li> It drys to a soft powdery feel once dry.  </li>
            <li> The spray feature allows you to use what you need rather than the tubes where you usually end up using far too much in areas.</li>
            <li> I received an uneven tan and burn, despite applying the product evenly over my entire body and reapplying practically every hour the first two days.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> Also love the way this product feels compared to other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past this one is not very greasy.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other non toxic sunscreens, I have tried this rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick film on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rubs into the skin a lot easier than other natural products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, i tend to break out with a lot of other sun screens.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems to sink into skin pretty well, but hard to say since I cannot use if for a while.</li>
            <li> , 14 Fluid Ounce due to its reported lack of harmful chemicals, and the reliability and safety of Kiss My Face products in general.</li>
            <li> After the first few broke we started being very careful with them</li>
            <li> I usually heed reviews pretty carefully, but I decided to roll the dice with this one.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a common theme in amazon reviews, and I wish I saw said reviews before I bought this at my Whole</li>
            <li> I ride a motorcycle and carry this with me on long rides..</li>
            <li> We used this all summer long and never got burned.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for a few years now and only this summer discovered this larger size bottle.</li>
            <li> A family of four had regular coatings of this sunscreen during a two week vacation and we still only used about half of the bottle!  </li>
            <li> and I like that it has less chemicals than traditional sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad and is definitely better than a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Great formula, horrible bottle.  </li>
            <li> Sinks in so its not greasy or sweaty.</li>
            <li> I purchased another bottle of this sunscreen since mine is almost empty and we were heading to another beach.</li>
            <li> Sticky, not really a lotion...</li>
            <li> I will have to go buy an empty spray bottle and use the sprayer from that to use for this Kiss My Face product.</li>
            <li> but this spray can go along with all other sprays for their damaging qualities.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> Stops pumping, leaks, prepare to transfer to other container.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients:</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself is fantastic, but the pump is still bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The hassle of a return is not worth returning the produce.</li>
            <li> I could only be so frustrated though after having plenty of warning from other disappointed purchasers lol</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time/money buying this spray nozzle sunscreen, buy the other KISS MY FACE sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I typically like with Hawaiian Tropic or Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> and we put it on a half hour to an hour before we went to the pool.  </li>
            <li> Sprays are a mess &amp; go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to use.  </li>
            <li> I ended up just opening the bottle and pouring a little out at a time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its just the pump with this bottle though since my other one is still working.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of a tan when I went on vacation in Mexico.</li>
            <li> and while wearing clothing, but at the beach we still burned a little.  </li>
            <li> My Face brand could put out such a poor product bottle.  </li>
            <li> (Aloe Vera Gel) Juice, Polysorbate-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates Copolymer, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Extract, Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin-E), Agaricus Bisporus (Mushroom</li>
            <li> so I was trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> but I was not about to waste it all.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m gardening, but not for everyday.  </li>
            <li> But the spray bottle broke after I&#x27;d only used it a few times, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 6 bottles now and the trigger in EVERY SINGLE one has broken.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have not had one of the trigger/pumps fail.</li>
            <li> We have given this sunscreen several chances to protect our family- failed each time.  </li>
            <li> But that becomes totally irrelevant when you&#x27;re forced to dump it in your hand and apply while kids are in constant motion, you&#x27;re chasing them and sunscreen ends up everywhere.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it smells like soured milk.</li>
            <li> This product however was not effective.  </li>
            <li> The only inconvenient is the size, we traveled and couldn&#x27;t take it my backpack to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why they would use a flimsy trigger to apply a thick liquid.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble the sprayer not working as some have claimed but there is a piece that locks the sprayer so it won&#x27;t spray out in your beach bag, maybe this has been turned and the person doesn&#x27;t realize it and thinks it is broken?</li>
            <li> and I was forced to dump the sunscreen out in my hand.</li>
            <li> Not a good product AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the concept of a very thick lotion in a spray dispenser.  </li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>
            <li> ONE spray and bam, broken.</li>
            <li> But the clowns who sell it packaged it so poorly that it exploded all over the envelope and leaked everywhere by the time it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because the pump was supposed to be improved after other reviewers said it was bad, but both of mine broke on me.</li>
            <li> The spray head/trigger is quite small and awkward to use if you want to pick it up and spray.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews about the faulty spray nozzle and figured it was either bad luck or misuse.  </li>
            <li> Sprayer came broken!</li>
            <li> Then it was realllly difficult to get the sunscreen out.</li>
            <li> ill have to use it for myself</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no suntan lotion newbie; every other lotion I&#x27;ve used never caused this issue for me, and I&#x27;ve never experienced a sunburn as terrible as the one while using this product.</li>
            <li> WHY WHY WHY use this crazy spray head design???  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> hate this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I hate the way this sprays out</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Read the Ingredients and the shocking price of those ingredients which will be sprayed in the air and some probably will land on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just hate the darn spray!</li>
            <li> Worst pump bottle ever.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this sunscreen; it goes on well and isn&#x27;t greasy. Im very happy that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals most sunscreens have in them either. The spray comes out kind of funny but that isn&#x27;t too much of an issue as this type of sunscreen needs to be rubbed on anyways. The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that the sprayer drips all over the place when using. Your spraying hand will be covered in sunscreen as will the ground below you. I&#x27;d recommend getting the regular lotion over this bottle</li>
            <li> Sprayer came broken! Will will review later if sprayer is easily replaced. I poured this sunscreen on my hand and rubbed it in grand kids and they were not sticky nor greasy NOR red!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about how the lotion sprays out, but I knew what I was getting into when I read other reviews so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. All in all, it is good sunscreen. It rubs in quickly and does not leave a white residue on the skin. My child has sensitive skin and the sunscreen does not bother him.</li>
            <li> 2 days in..spray head breaks. Whole point of having spray sunscreen is to add spray! Now have to pour out onto my hand. Defeats purpose. Fix the bottle.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, smells great, very effective, leaves skin feeling soft and not sticky.  But the spray bottle broke after I&#x27;d only used it a few times, rendering it useless.  If the company replaces the packaging I would be willing to try it again, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, no oxybenzone, sunscreen in a larger size for the whole family.  I read the negative reviews about the faulty spray nozzle and figured it was either bad luck or misuse.  I didn&#x27;t believe the Kiss My Face brand could put out such a poor product bottle.  Unfortunately, my experience was the same as many others.  After using the spray pump the 2nd outing, the spray pump would not work and could not be repaired.  I opted to buy Alba Botanical Dry Oil to replace it and also noticed a huge difference in the protection it provided, as well as a much better spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Researched looking for best sunscreens, this was on several lists. I purchased a bunch of different brands, looking for something that my family would actually use on a regular basis. We all love this sunscreen! It is not thick and greasy. Goes on smooth, feels great, and most importantly, we actually use it! Easy to apply to kids in spray bottle, but is not an aerosol, which is good!</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen, nice spray, easily applicable.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Works well on my sensitive skin. Sinks in so its not greasy or sweaty. It&#x27;s the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> The pump with lotion makes putting this on squirmy kids so much easier - I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Sprays are a mess &amp; go everywhere.  Love this one!</li>
            <li> Had the same problem with this as with the regular lotion of the same name; namely I got burned.  That being said, I will give it one more try on the chance that I did not reapply as much as I should have.</li>
            <li> Living in Hawaii we go through sun screen like water and thus stuff works well, is fairly priced, and not full of too many chemicals that will kill you later in life :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this.  Both my kids are swimmers and I thought the price for a spray on was great!  UNTIL I got it home.  Sprayer broke within a week.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was not greasy since I have to wear it daily.  The dermatologist recommended this and it is great!</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals here. Good price, goes on well. Its a touch greasy, but not enough to bother us.</li>
            <li> The nozzle broke very quickly after buying which was of course a huge pain.  Aside from that, the big issue is that my kids and I got sunburned through the sunscreen.  Not a good product AT ALL.  We&#x27;ve had much better luck with the Alba line of kids sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said, the sprayer didn&#x27;t work. Not even once. The sunscreen itself is amazing though and because of that, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the concept of a very thick lotion in a spray dispenser.  I cannot use this without getting it all over the bathroom and my clothes, even though I cup my hand over the sprayer to try to contain it.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients... Nothing harmful... works great. I ride a motorcycle and carry this with me on long rides..</li>
            <li> Great price and came super fast! Also love the way this product feels compared to other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past this one is not very greasy.</li>
            <li> Lotion made skin sticky and greasy looking. Sprayer broke 2nd time I used it. Did alright get blocking sun.</li>
            <li> This is our second KMF sunscreen bought this year, and the spray nozzle broke the second time we used it. The first bottle broke on the third use. The ONLY reason I buy it is because of how easy it is to apply and rub in. IF you have a working bottle, it&#x27;s the best sunscreen around. But that becomes totally irrelevant when you&#x27;re forced to dump it in your hand and apply while kids are in constant motion, you&#x27;re chasing them and sunscreen ends up everywhere.</li>
            <li> Smells good, cruelty free, and is easy to apply. The only good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First issue: spray nozzle broke on the second day of my vacation. This seems to be a common theme in amazon reviews, and I wish I saw said reviews before I bought this at my Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second issue: the lotion just did not work for me. I received an uneven tan and burn, despite applying the product evenly over my entire body and reapplying practically every hour the first two days. I&#x27;m no suntan lotion newbie; every other lotion I&#x27;ve used never caused this issue for me, and I&#x27;ve never experienced a sunburn as terrible as the one while using this product. For that reason, I say avoid.</li>
            <li> The bottle never worked from day 1 of arrival. I just unscrew the spray cap and spread the sunscreen with my hands. Even though the bottle is defective, the sunscreen is still a good alternative to traditional sunscreen. It&#x27;s rubs into the skin a lot easier than other natural products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; look either. It&#x27;s a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The lotion is quite nice; however, the spray bottle broke within the first 2 minutes of opening it.  The trigger broke.  Will not be buying again!</li>
            <li> I really liked this Sunscreen, I found it easy to apply to mine and my kids skin with the spray nozzle. I feel provided a good protection. Great Value!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it smells like soured milk. Gross. It would be a major pain for me to return or I would. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen, it&#x27;s great, all of the sun protection but none of the bad stuff! That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this spray bottle. It seems to be fine if I&#x27;m spraying someone else, but if I have to use my left hand to spray myself, let&#x27;s say to get my right arm, the whole top seems to just come off. My husband manages to fix it afterward but really, I don&#x27;t feel like this should be happening EVERY time I use it. I&#x27;d rather not have a spray bottle than deal with the frustration of the top coming off in my hand.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super oily like other sun screens and sprays on well. It also, held it consistency after being left in my car in the middle of a Florida summer.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen seems to be effective and non irritating, but it doesn&#x27;t spray on at all evenly. It will mist in one place and shoot globs elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Safer ingredients, the spray works just fine! Easy application for kids! Just spray and rub in.</li>
            <li> I hate the way this sprays out but it works great!  I ended up just opening the bottle and pouring a little out at a time.</li>
            <li> WHY WHY WHY use this crazy spray head design???  I can&#x27;t understand why they would use a flimsy trigger to apply a thick liquid.  The sunscreen itself is great, but the spray is severe drawback.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having a baby and reading all of the reviews on the harmful chemicals in most sunscreens.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have any of that, goes on easily, and comes at a much better price than all of the other natural sunscreens I researched.  The sprayer is handy and mine hasn&#x27;t broken or given any problems (knock on wood).  We used this all summer long and never got burned.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house loves the consistency of this product,  Goes on easily!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen pictured works well.  Non-irritating, effective,easy to apply.  This isn&#x27;t the sunscreen I received however.  The one I received has the irritant Hydresia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for a few years now and only this summer discovered this larger size bottle. This is a great deal on a less harsh sunscreen for the family. I prefer to spray it into my hands and than apply to my kids. It rubs in easily and makes getting 4 kids lathered up for the sun quick and easy. It has a mild scent and I like that it has less chemicals than traditional sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Great concept and the sunscreen is nice but our pump broke on e second day and now we have a bottle full of lotion with no working pump....</li>
            <li> the sunscreen feels a bit on the thin side which slightly concerns me in terms of how long it is effective, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 7.50%, Octisalate 4.00%, Zinc Oxide 1.70%, Avobenzone 1.00%.&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: Aqua (Deionized Water), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Gel) Juice, Polysorbate-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates Copolymer, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Extract, Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin-E), Agaricus Bisporus (Mushroom) Betaglucans, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land on your face. Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 1.70% and more unneeded ingredients. Kiss My Face has the best soap but forget about the sunscreens, that is a whole world by itself. Kiss My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula but this spray can go along with all other sprays for their damaging qualities. Read the Ingredients and the shocking price of those ingredients which will be sprayed in the air and some probably will land on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, Nutrogina, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce. If chemicals are not disturbing to you, then roofing tar offers the best sunscreen on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane, alcohol. What goes on skin is the same as being consumed through the skin. Chemicals, alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin.V Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane, alcohol.

            <li> My kids like this sunscreen above all the others I&#x27;ve tried that were rated 4 or better from ewg.com.  It does not feel greasy, rubs in clear even on very tan/dark skin and smells pleasant.  The spray is not as convenient as the aerosols but better than a squeeze bottle.  Just Spray and rub in.</li>
            <li> Great formula, horrible bottle.  It&#x27;s a mess to use.  The trajectory of the spray sucks if this formula was in a squeeze bottle, it would be perfect.  It drys to a soft powdery feel once dry.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I like the smell, kind of pepperminty.  I love wearing this I just hate the darn spray! Another note, I would use this for cooler weather rather than hot weather as although it does feel sticky and clammy when you first wear it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast but for how well it moisturize while protecting you from the sun, I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the first Kiss My Face product I&#x27;ve been less than thrilled with. This sunscreen must be applied so frequently that it becomes cumbersome. I wanted to love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power and I ended up with a burn.</li>
            <li> Love this product and bought many bottles but the sprayer trigger broke on ALL bottles. The should come up with better quality trigger.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself is fantastic, but the pump is still bad. I have now had two of them break on me. I bought this sunscreen because the pump was supposed to be improved after other reviewers said it was bad, but both of mine broke on me. Once the pump is broken, the sunscreen looses its convenience and you go through much more of it.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. But I spent a little extra for the spray top and it broke right away. Then it was realllly difficult to get the sunscreen out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good sunscreen, it&#x27;s right in this bottle. Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll have to unscrew the spray top and pour out the sunscreen to use it. I&#x27;ve purchased two of these bottles and both spray tops broke within the first five sprays. We&#x27;re not talking clogged nozzles; the sprayer head just popped right off and cannot be reattached...on both bottles. I&#x27;m still using the sunscreen, because I like this brand, and it works well, but I wish KMF would fix this issue.</li>
            <li> We went to Aruba for 2 weeks and from experience we fly thru SPF so I was trying to save a few bucks. I usually heed reviews pretty carefully, but I decided to roll the dice with this one. The spray nozzle that everyone complains about breaking? It literally worked ONE time. ONE spray and bam, broken. I could only be so frustrated though after having plenty of warning from other disappointed purchasers lol&lt;br /&gt;Ended up using it anyway, a real pain to unscrew what was left of the cap but I was not about to waste it all. Worked fine as far as sun protection goes.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen,bad pump design</li>
            <li> The store brand spray-on sunscreen I buy at the local grocery store was out of stock, so I tried this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light and has almost no scent. It&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re wearing it. While I do live in Florida, I generally spend minutes, rather than hours in the sun, so I don&#x27;t know how this product works for long-term sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I found was getting the product out of the container. The spray head/trigger is quite small and awkward to use if you want to pick it up and spray. I have resorted to leaving the bottle on the counter and spraying the lotion into my hand rather than trying to spray directly onto my arms or legs. I would not even attempt to use this on a trip or outside where I might drop it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to put on sunscreen everyday.  I&#x27;ll have periods of remembering to put it on each morning, but I ultimately fall out of it.  I bought this spray hoping it would be so quick and easy to put on that I would be more likely to do it.  So far, so good.  I&#x27;m planning to get another bottle to keep at my desk at work, so I can put some on mid-day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer hasn&#x27;t broken yet and the sunscreen goes on easily without requiring too much time to rub in.</li>
            <li> No burns, breakouts, or rashes on anyone from baby to adults all summer.  It was easy to spray.  It didn&#x27;t mix with sweat and burn my eyes.  I really can&#x27;t ask for more in any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I love the convenient sprayer which helps get this on quick and easily with squirming kids.  Seems to work well and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. I haven&#x27;t had trouble the sprayer not working as some have claimed but there is a piece that locks the sprayer so it won&#x27;t spray out in your beach bag, maybe this has been turned and the person doesn&#x27;t realize it and thinks it is broken?</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen ! Worst pump bottle ever. Stops pumping, leaks, prepare to transfer to other container.</li>
            <li> I like this but the scent is too strong for my daughter so I won&#x27;t be getting more- ill have to use it for myself</li>
            <li> arrival ontime, we live in the snshine and this sunblock is natural and sprays perfectly&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get it people say they have problems with bottle is a great price too for such a big&lt;br /&gt;bottle</li>
            <li> This is the second summer I have stocked up in this product. Non toxic and no nanoparticles were what drew me to try it out. Unlike some other non toxic sunscreens, I have tried this rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick film on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER I have purchased 6 bottles now and the trigger in EVERY SINGLE one has broken. I had to start pouring it out on to my hands which of course wasted it and made me go through it way too fast. I wrote the company and they sent me 3 new pumps which also broke. After the first few broke we started being very careful with them but they still didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that they would improve this problem from last year but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t. After I use it all up I may have to start shopping for something else. I am willing to spend money on quality products but this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> UPDATE - June, 10, 2013 - I purchased another bottle of this sunscreen since mine is almost empty and we were heading to another beach. The second time I purchased it, the bottle was a completely different shape than the first but same ounces so I didn&#x27;t think too much about it. My first use of the pump though, I now know what others have experienced! The whole handle mechanism broke and I was forced to dump the sunscreen out in my hand. Not sure if its just the pump with this bottle though since my other one is still working. I plan on transferring the remaining product into my working bottle but still, I would hope they could fix this. I stand by this sunscreen though. It works great and feels good on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this for a Mexico vacation for a snorkel trip where they require biodegradable sunscreen. Even though I ended up not using it for that purpose, I still really like this sunscreen and ended up using it throughout my entire vacation. My nozzle is still working even after nearly 3/4 of the bottle is gone so maybe they fixed the issue with it breaking? It sprays out in a mist you can see and its super easy to rub in, which I love! The smell is okay but doesn&#x27;t have that summer time smell I typically like with Hawaiian Tropic or Banana Boat. I&#x27;ve been using the aerosol cans for the last year out of convenience but don&#x27;t like the film they end up leaving on your skin. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> A nice lotion but the spray doesn&#x27;t work that well. Next time I would buy a bottle or tube.</li>
            <li> After 3 attempts to receive this product intact, i have given up.  I think a seal over the bottle opening with the pump handle packaged separately would be ideal.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen!! with favorable rating on EWG.com!! no bad or toxic ingredients.  I have reordered this many times.  Even my husband likes it and keeps a bottle in his truck.  The spray makes it so easy.  Spray into hands to use on face.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this and I feel safe putting it on my kids. The only thing is that the nozzle sometimes doesn&#x27;t squirt the lotion out well and I still don&#x27;t know why. But I will keep buying this product either way.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and not a greasy sunscreen either!</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen from a cruelty-free company.  I use this when I&#x27;m gardening, but not for everyday.  It leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, however, 3 days into our vacation, the spraying function on the bottle broke, leave us to have to unscrew it and use it like normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This provides some protection, but it is not my favorite.  I will use it up but will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of a tan when I went on vacation in Mexico. Used this product and had a very enjoyable vacation without any sunburn. Came back with a gorgeous tan!</li>
            <li> This product smells alright and goes on like a good lotion,keeps me from getting burned and is petrolium free.Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen. This product is great. I really like that is is nature friendly too. Just a heads-up. All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue. It&#x27;s not that bad and is definitely better than a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Sticky, not really a lotion... But it does work.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen lotion, but the cap/sprayer broke very fast.</li>
            <li> The suncreen is the best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the spray mechanism on the bottle is absolute garbage.  I&#x27;ve had to buy a separate spray bottle that I transfer the lotion to when the bottle breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for years and the bottle is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself has worked well for our family.  The pumper broke on third use with normal usage.  Now we have to unscrew the top to use it.</li>
            <li> My pump also broke about 1/2 way into using the product.  I wrote to customer service and they said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for using Kiss My Face sunscreen!  I have checked with our production team; there has been an issue with some of these bottles with the pumps and they are working with our manufacturer now to fix the problem.  Please note that the sunscreen can still be applied as a lotion if you would like to still use it.  Please email me the lot code # that starts with EXP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, we certainly want you to be satisfied.  We would like to replace it for you with our Sports Spray SPF50.  It&#x27;s a clear, no mess spray that goes on quickly and dries in seconds.  It has a light coconut scent.  Please let me know if this is ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And be assured that I will add your comments to the customer service log that is reviewed at the manager&#x27;s meeting every month.  We value your feedback and these comments are taken very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---So I&#x27;m waiting to get the replacement bottle.....I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again for the pump spray, but I do like the smoothness of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, i tend to break out with a lot of other sun screens. With this one I&#x27;ve been good so far.</li>
            <li> Who sends a 14-ounce bottle of liquid in a padded envelope?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this sunscreen, but the bottles have always had issues and the sprayers don&#x27;t work after a while, so I decided to buy a large bottle and fill my own bottles with the contents. But the clowns who sell it packaged it so poorly that it exploded all over the envelope and leaked everywhere by the time it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen.  Didn&#x27;t clog my pores and did what it was intended to do.  Lasts awhile and easy to pump.  Decent smell with no irritating or breaking out.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The nozzle on the bottle broke after the 4th spray. I am still using the sunscreen, which I like, however its a pain to take the SPRAY NOZZLE off the bottle to use the sunscreen. I bought the spray for easier use.  Don&#x27;t waste your time/money buying this spray nozzle sunscreen, buy the other KISS MY FACE sunscreens. I would give the sunscreen a 5 star, it&#x27;s the bottle that gets the 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> Worked really good for my sensitive, allergic child. Very light and no greasy feeling after applying it. Only wish that it came with SPF 50</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock!  A family of four had regular coatings of this sunscreen during a two week vacation and we still only used about half of the bottle!  The spray feature allows you to use what you need rather than the tubes where you usually end up using far too much in areas.</li>
            <li> very handy in a group setting at the pool</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND&#x27;S SUNSCREEN! I used it for the first time in Aruba in 50SPF, reapplied every 2 hours, and got 3rd degree burns on my skin. I want to sue the company.&lt;br /&gt;Save your skin and don&#x27;t use this or any of Kiss My Face sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> Goes on weightless. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> works well in water but the darn bottle design keeps getting clogged</li>
            <li> My family loved this sunscreen last year. It went on easy and dried well. I bought this again this year (2015) and there is a new formula. It is now water resistant for 80 minutes. It has made it super sticky and I can&#x27;t stand it. So disappointed. I wish amazon listed them seperate so I could choose the 40 minute water resistant formula. Gave three starts because I would give old formula 5 stars and new formula 1.</li>
            <li> did ok for walking around at the market etc. and while wearing clothing, but at the beach we still burned a little.  went for kiss my face spf 50, which was a little better.  we still had to apply the spf 50 every 30-40 minutes.  seemed like the &amp;#34;cheap-o&amp;#34; stuff our friends wore worked better?</li>
            <li> The sunscreen worked, but the spray bottle broke (the nozzle) after about 10 sprays. I just took the top of it off and used it as I would a bottle of non-spray sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have not had one of the trigger/pumps fail. But my brother, within seconds of using one bottle, broke one. But I love the product and the value of the large format. If they could make the pumps more reliable, it would be outstanding.</li>
            <li> Lotion is not greasy. When you spray it, you actually get a great amount of lotion. Just love it for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this Kiss My Face Sun Spray Lotion Sunscreen SPF 30, 14 Fluid Ounce due to its reported lack of harmful chemicals, and the reliability and safety of Kiss My Face products in general. I had an experience identical to what others report here, despite Kiss My Face&#x27;s comment that they have redesigned the bottle to address this issue.  I just HOPE I received one of the older bottles and this was not the redesign! The trigger broke at the neck of the bottle after just one use.  The lotion itself seems quite good.  What a shame.  Kiss My Face, please make this right! We like your products and want to continue using them.</li>
            <li> Sunblock is fine, but the spay top is terrible and consistently brakes or is inoperable.</li>
            <li> *I bought they updated and corrected bottle, but it still broke. I just started using this product more in the last week or so and already the pump/sprayer broke. I will have to go buy an empty spray bottle and use the sprayer from that to use for this Kiss My Face product. The product itself seems to sink into skin pretty well, but hard to say since I cannot use if for a while. The hassle of a return is not worth returning the produce. I just will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK!  TERRIBLE!  We have given this sunscreen several chances to protect our family- failed each time.  We applied it liberally and thoroughly, then waited 15-20 minutes before sun exposure.  We reapplied it every 45 minutes.  We were ALL sunburned.  Warning: you must use a stronger and more reliable sunscreen than this one if you plan on being in the sun.  Spray nozzle broke the first day, and was never able to be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Product does not protect sun AND Spray nozzle defective.</li>
            <li> Overall I really love &amp;#34;Kiss My Face Sunscreen Lotion&amp;#34;.  This product however was not effective.  My kids got so much color and we put it on a half hour to an hour before we went to the pool.  I wanted to love it this year again, maybe it was expired so it was ineffective due to that.</li>
            <li> Spray cap broke within first few days of use.</li>
            <li> I liked the  quality of this product and is easy to apply on children. The only inconvenient is the size, we traveled and couldn&#x27;t take it my backpack to re-apply. It is easy to rinse off in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave greasy skin.</li>
            <li> Buy it and try it! It moisturizes too</li>
