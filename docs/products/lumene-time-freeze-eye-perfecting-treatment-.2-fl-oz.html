            <li>However, it does feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Many, if not all, hydrate and moisturize.</li>
            <li>Use it on top of the eye also, it will give you a lifted appearance.</li>
            <li>Should have know better.  </li>
            <li>Love the Lumene products.</li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>but it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before and enjoy it.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much money I have spent on eye creams. I kept purchasing them looking for one that would reduce puffiness under the eyes. Many, if not all, hydrate and moisturize. However prior to using Lumene Finland Time Freeze Eye Perfecting Treatment, none of them got rid of bags and puffiness under the eyes. This one does a great job! It&#x27;s not cosmetic surgery but it makes a huge difference. Use it on top of the eye also, it will give you a lifted appearance. This cream is better than the expensive Lancome Absolute eye cream, Olay Pro-X, Loreal Youth Code, Olay Regenerist and many more.  If you are looking for a remedy for puffiness, this is it. If conditioning and moisturizing is what you need, then any of them will do. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it. I hope this helps. None of the reviews I have read address the bag and puffiness issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this little two ounce thing.. Am I missing something?  Not sure that it is working.  Maybe, but am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.</li>
            <li> I got this by accident one time, but I kept so glad I did best I have ever used &amp; awesome price.</li>
            <li> I have seen no difference after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a while now.  Is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a product meant to refresh and tighten the skin on your eye lids, I&#x27;d read nothing but good reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot. After a few weeks I wholeheartedly agree with the other positive reviews. This is a soft exfoliating formula that brightens and tightens. After a few treatments I noticed flaking on my lids which told me it was doing its job. I gently removed the flaking to find the skin underneath was softer, brighter and tighter. Yea!  I use this in my PM skin routine only. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off~ there was almost nothing in the container. I used it once and when I went back the second day there was nothing to get out. I have written to either obtain another product and have my money refunded but no response!</li>
            <li> Waste of money&lt;br /&gt;No change around my eyes</li>
            <li> Does not do what it claims....imagine that.  Should have know better.  However, it does feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I struggle with bags under my eyes. I have tried so many things and this is one that works! I apply it before bed and wake up with much smaller bags! Get it, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Go Lumene and Finland. This cream delivers as promised, and I have seen a difference in my eye area.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Time will tell if it works.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOW GONE THROUGH 2 TUBES OF THIS AND i USE IT ALL THE TIME I GOT THE IDEA TO START USING THIS FROM BETHANY FRANKEL AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVER SINCE</li>
            <li> I heard this was a good product from someone on the Oz show but I was very disappointed. I feel like it made the wrinkles under my eyes worse. I would not recommend spending the money on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and enjoy it.I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it. Delivery was fast and price was right. I&#x27;m very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the Lumene products.</li>
            <li> Received this serum after following advice from Good Housekeeping.  As far as I am concerned, the product was not worth the money as I saw no results.</li>
            <li> It has not done the job I expected wrinkles still there and darkness not good at all.</li>
            <li> Product is ok. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference after using for a month.</li>
