            <li>This shampoo and conditioner came quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement since the company was sold to another company and many people were saying that the formula of Nexxus Therappe had changed.</li>

            <li>I love Aquage shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Could not find my favorite shampoo in any salon</li>
            <li>So far my hair is still holding color and smells great every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and safely packaged.</li>
            <li>I then bought a BIG bottle of the newer Nexxus Therappe for about 10 bucks and it is GREAT.</li>

            <li>Leaves your hair very silky and shinny.  </li>
            <li>Although it is expensive it is worth it and makes your hair feel silky smooth while smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to clean and tame my curls and frizz.</li>
            <li>But if I want to purchase the product again, I just hope I get a new and never been open package next time.</li>
            <li>This is the shampoo that my hairdresser uses and I was tired of trying to find a shampoo from the grocery store that says it is safe for colored hair and it actually strips my hair of all color.  </li>

            <li> The bottles are smaller than I expected, as 10.1 oz really is not a lot.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the 1 liter bottles, but they lasted a very long time, so I decided to go with the smaller set this time.  </li>
            <li> However, it should last me a few months, which is just what I wanted.</li>

            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my hair and for weaves. Leaves your hair silky to the touch every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Lots of suds hydrating</li>
            <li> I always want to try this product. When it came in the mail it was all open. The box was all dented and the conditioner was open ans spilling all over the box. I really want to return the product but my friend assist she want it for her dog to wash on. But if I want to purchase the product again, I just hope I get a new and never been open package next time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner came quickly and in good condition.  I have been using Joico K-Pak for over a year, and my hair is noticeably healthier.  I had previously purchased the 1 liter bottles, but they lasted a very long time, so I decided to go with the smaller set this time.  The bottles are smaller than I expected, as 10.1 oz really is not a lot.  However, it should last me a few months, which is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I switch shampoos a lot but I always go back to this one.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, you need to!!</li>
            <li> Always looking for great quality products that don&#x27;t test on animals. Look no further.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aquage Hydratiing Shampoo for years, it is the BEST amount all the others I had used before.  My hair is super hydrated, yet not having greasy feeling to the scalp.  I received the shipment within 4 days from the date I ordered, very well packed.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for hair that needs hydration.  Lathers nicely!!!</li>
            <li> WIth over processed hair I need the hydration that this gives and Aquage is just THE BEST brand out there~</li>
            <li> Overpriced and over rated. I have used Nexxus Therappe shampoo since it&#x27;s inception. I was looking for a replacement since the company was sold to another company and many people were saying that the formula of Nexxus Therappe had changed. So, I thought I&#x27;d buy this instead of the newer version of Nexxus. This is over priced shampoo that doesn&#x27;t do anything that any drug store discount shampoo can&#x27;t do. It just cleans your hair. It didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair. I then bought a BIG bottle of the newer Nexxus Therappe for about 10 bucks and it is GREAT. So, I&#x27;m back to Nexxus Therappe. I really find this Aquage to be all hype and no substance. Baloney.</li>
