            <li>/&gt;This really is a fantastic company, that I truly trust.  </li>
            <li>I understand it&#x27;s a rich balm</li>

            <li>I end up using this balm as hand cream instead and it works great on my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li>I liked everything else I tried by this brand so far..</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a little greasy and waxy.....</li>
            <li> Yes it has a little bit of grit</li>
            <li> This is a seemingly small jar, but has lasted me over a month already, and I am not even half way through it!</li>
            <li> They really do contain organic, natural products without anything nasty being snuck in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> A small complaint is how greasy/sticky it is!</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this product, but I hated it.. very disappointing, especially considering the price &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about it, but it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, but that&#x27;s not a problem since it&#x27;s meant to be used at night.</li>
            <li> though the balm felt horrible on my skin from day one, I still used the whole jar waiting for results &amp; keeping faith in it</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because the texture is too weird</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst eye product I have ever tried from 100%</li>
            <li> the amount I paid for this product, on a night cream that contains 3x the amount of crap!!</li>
            <li> Horrible pasty-like granual feeling and not at all creamy like a moisturizer should be.</li>

            <li> I love this balm!!! It is super greasy, however, if you apply it at night, it will absorb into your skin throughout the night making it feel so smooth in the morning. I partner this with a little hyaluronic acid serum or vitamin C serum before application and it does wonders. I have this really heavy crease (I&#x27;m not going to say the W word, I just hit my mid 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;m really not going there yet) on my forehead, I guess it&#x27;s from constantly looking surprised, and this balm is really helping to relax the crease, something that only a glycolic peel has helped me do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry skin that is in need of rejuvenation I recommend this night balm, but it should be paired with a serum for maximum results.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. It is safe and it works, what more can one want?! It scored 2 on the Cosmetic Database, and it really does a good job moisturizing. It&#x27;s very thick, but that&#x27;s not a problem since it&#x27;s meant to be used at night.It has a blueberry smell to it. I&#x27;m not too crazy about it, but it&#x27;s not very strong. Don&#x27;t use it during the day. It&#x27;s not meant to be used that way, and it contains Retinol which is unsafe when used in daylight. Some sources say it&#x27;s safe to use Retinol products under a sunscreen during the day, but I guess that would mean being pretty vigilant about applying sunscreen more than just once in the morning. I would skip it during the day.</li>
            <li> This was greasier than I expected. It is definitely a balm and takes time to absorb. However, my skin seems to like it while my pillow sheets do not.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft and smooth.  I have also noticed the appearance of my skin is better since using this.  I like the 100% pure face cleansers and moisturizers.  The body wash is good too.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so supple and soft. Will keep buying!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst eye product I have ever tried from 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like candle wax when you first open the jar. The balm feels like a solid lip balm and it&#x27;s hard to scoop the content out with finger. It has a weird grainy powder, and I have to rub it hard around my eyes that already have fine lines to make it work. I stopped using it because the texture is too weird and it&#x27;s extremely greasy. I end up using this balm as hand cream instead and it works great on my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> I love this night balm!  It&#x27;s so thick and my skin feels wonderful after wearing it all night.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I cannot BELIEVE that I have been spending (easily) 3x the amount I paid for this product, on a night cream that contains 3x the amount of crap!! Great price, great product. It&#x27;s a heavier cream (most night creams are) but when I wake in the morning my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I have used it once and plan on tossing it.  It is mainly the consistency that I don&#x27;t like, I have not used it enough to weigh in on if it works.  I needed a night time moisturizer that is slightly heavier that a gel moisturizer because i sleep on my side with a pillow.  I don&#x27;t want my face drying out during the night.  I thought this would be a light but more substantial moisturizer.  For me this was like putting pure shea butter on and my skin can not handle that.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve give it 1 star but I really like 100% Pure brand for being genuinely natural, &amp; I liked everything else I tried by this brand so far.. but this product definitely needs more work..&lt;br /&gt;Even though the balm felt horrible on my skin from day one, I still used the whole jar waiting for results &amp; keeping faith in it (that&#x27;s how much  like this brand).. I still didn&#x27;t see any improvement or even changes in my skin..  I understand it&#x27;s a rich balm but it was WAY too greasy &amp; felt like it never got absorbed by skin.. I would wake up &amp; my face would still be shiny, my pillow would be greasy &amp; my hair would need to be washed because it would get oily (&amp; no, I didn&#x27;t apply a TON of the product on my face, in fact I would try to use less because the grease was so out of control)..&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product, but I hated it.. very disappointing, especially considering the price &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(it is possible that I got an expired product, because it didn&#x27;t seem to be sealed very well when I received it &#x3D;/)</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I like even more that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
            <li> I like night balm A LOT!  Arrives very timely!  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Horrible pasty-like granual feeling and not at all creamy like a moisturizer should be. Feels greasy and does not absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> My Skin feels great - I live in a very arid climate - this has worked miracles - smells great too -</li>
            <li> For those complaining about the consistency and how it isn&#x27;t smooth and creamy, what part of BALM do you not understand?  It&#x27;s supposed to be a little greasy and waxy.....like lip balm.  There is nothing on here that says it&#x27;s a cream.  If that&#x27;s what you are looking for then try the creams.  And it&#x27;s for right before you go to bed, so it&#x27;s not like people will see your face.  I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this balm. Yes it has a little bit of grit but once it warms up on your skin it disappears. It&#x27;s been amazing during these cold winter days. No more dry skin. Can&#x27;t wait to use more products from this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I think my skin looks better since starting on the balm. A small complaint is how greasy/sticky it is! My hair gets stuck to my face after I use it at night. Ick.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for TRULY natural products to use on my face and skin, after an extensive episode where my skin reacted to the chemical-laden products I had been using for years.  There are many companies that label their products \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;, but once you read the label you will see differently.  The 100% pure brand is the one that I trust completely. I purchase their makeup, lotion, body care products, body wash, etc.. everything! They really do contain organic, natural products without anything nasty being snuck in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super fruits night balm is fantastic! When you go to apply it, it feels a little gritty, but once it warms to your face, it melts right in.  I don&#x27;t mind it, because it feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating just a bit before absorbing, which is great! But, if if bothers you, rub it between your fingers for about three seconds, which melts it, then apply! Voila! It feels great on my sensitive, dry skin.  It does contain vitamin a, a retinol (the very last ingredient), but it&#x27;s very non irritating (don&#x27;t use it right before going out in the sunlight though).  This is a seemingly small jar, but has lasted me over a month already, and I am not even half way through it! There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent, so it shouldn&#x27;t bother those with sensitive noses.  Using a natural product allows your skin to repair itself naturally.  Your skin is your biggest organ, and if you overload it with toxins, how will it be able to look and feel its best?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a fantastic company, that I truly trust.  If you are looking around for a new body cream, you must try their Honey Almond nourishing body lotion, it smells just like almond extract!</li>
            <li> I only use organic or all natural skin and body care and this balm has worked great at night against the dry cold weather of winter.</li>
