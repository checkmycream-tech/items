    <ol>
            <li>Has to be the best smelling conditioner on the planet!  </li>
            <li>I this works best when used with the glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great products!</li>
            <li>Really great, lightweight moisture.</li>
            <li>but this conditioner is a great complement.  </li>
            <li>This product is consistently great.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner .</li>
            <li>The shine was amazing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I use this after a leave-in treatment and a clarifying shampoo, and the result is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>it smells good too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good shampoo.....</li>
            <li>I received this conditioner as part of a Buzz Campaign (I&#x27;m a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!)</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>~i love that!</li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to give me that \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; shine.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, and does not make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li>In addition, I was surprised to discover that neither the shampoo nor conditioner smells very good</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it.</li>
            <li>I got samples of this product because I&#x27;m a bzz agent, and I immediately fell in love with the product.  </li>
            <li>i just love this product.</li>
            <li>I already have healthy, shiny hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my curls are conditioned, softer and have more shine.  </li>
            <li>I think the shampoo does more for my hair</li>
            <li>But after just 2 days I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered Fekkai.  </li>
            <li>The Glossing Shampoo, Conditioner and Cream make my hair look and feel better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>My wife love&#x27;s this product.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best smelling conditioner because it contains olive oil but definitely does the job if your looking for shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I would be sure to use the cream cautiously around the scalp as it will look too greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to add any detaingler or leave in conditioner after and  have to be sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of the Fekkai Glossing shampoo and conditioner and I am hooked!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair as I have after using these two products.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Even the split ends were more tamed.</li>
            <li>Also, I get a much more shine with One n</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing--not strong at all.</li>
            <li>When I want my hair to look beautiful for special occasions, this will definitely be the shampoo/conditioner that I use.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if the conditioner bottle was just a couple ounces larger than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Disclosure: I received a free sample of Fekkai glossing shampoo and conditioner for free from BzzAgent to sample.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and so much cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>make my hair smooth and shine</li>
            <li>These are minor complaints, and I&#x27;m going to stock up on Fekkai products to make my hair beautiful when it counts.</li>
            <li>From the scent to the rich texture, I feel like I&#x27;m at a salon when I use it.</li>
            <li>I know it costs more than drugstore brands, and I try to be frugal when spending money, but if I find a product that does exactly what I&#x27;m looking for (and I can&#x27;t find a cheaper version)</li>
            <li>Kinda clean apple ish.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but very light.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well and leaves your hair looking shiny and super healthy.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and makes my  hair really shiny!</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on fine, thin hair and gives incredible shine and volume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, just a gentle crisp clean scent.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because I need more conditioner than shampoo, so I&#x27;m going to run out of that before the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great for my thick, unruly hair.</li>
            <li>If you use it too many days in a row there could be a residual effect and it would be wise to do a day of regular shampoo and conditioner every few days.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a conditioning mask daily because my hair is very dry, but this stuff feels light, rinses easily, and somehow conditions better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>conditioner left my hair looking shiny and healthy, and less brittle than most conditioners in the price range.</li>
            <li>it also is real shinny because i buy the glossing it works on color treated hair also.</li>
            <li>I purchased just the conditioner (I use L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free smoothing shampoo daily to protect the color</li>
            <li>Along with the shampoo, this conditioner is the only hair product that leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>At first I was not sure about it because it was thicker then most conditioners.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it also helps my naturally wavy hair stay straight</li>
            <li>However, I have always had a dry, itchy scalp with mild dandruff that I thought I would have to live with forever--I&#x27;ve used T-Gel, Head and Shoulders, etc to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5 stars, but there&#x27;s nothing bad about this great product.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really see any major change in its \\&quot;glossiness,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft without being to heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for any hair product that will make my hair shiny and silky (and if it helps it stay straight, that&#x27;s a definite plus).</li>
            <li>Smoother and straighter and so so so soft.</li>
            <li>you will drop your old shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>comparison, I have thin fine hair but a high number of follicles, split ends, and highlights and lowlights.</li>
            <li>barely* had to use any John Frieda frizz-ease</li>
            <li>Most hair products leave my hair dry, coarse, and dull.</li>
            <li>My hair went from dry and frizzy to soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Too bad this original version is not available any more !</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a light weight conditioner, I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> but they seem to last a really long time.  </li>
            <li> $22 (Target price) is more than I usually spend on shampoo/conditioner, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it everyday post-Bzz Campaign, but I know I&#x27;ll replace it when gone and will use it when I need to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> No greasiness, no need to wash every single day.</li>
            <li> Only brand argan oil conditioner, which costs less.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad by any means, but for a $80 shampoo-conditioner combo, I&#x27;d like it to smell a bit better.  </li>
            <li> and have been using it the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, I know, but it&#x27;s well worth it if it cures my dandruff and itchiness.  </li>
            <li> and then once a week I use Shimmer Lights to enhance my color) expecting a high-end smell but not much else</li>
            <li> A little of each of theses go a long way.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work well, due to rave reviews and the olive</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair sufficiently for everyday use, so it won&#x27;t replace my daily hair products.</li>
            <li> I also put on the glossing cream which helps tame the curls.</li>
            <li> , usually I have to pile it on to tame the frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> --boy was I wrong!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people with thick hair. Friends with thinner hair who have tried this say that it makes their hair to greasy. Personally, I love it. It smells fantastic and makes my  hair really shiny!</li>
            <li> I got samples of this product because I&#x27;m a bzz agent, and I immediately fell in love with the product.  My hair went from dry and frizzy to soft and shiny!  The prices are a little on the high side for the size bottle but they seem to last a really long time.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because I need more conditioner than shampoo, so I&#x27;m going to run out of that before the shampoo.  It would be great if the conditioner bottle was just a couple ounces larger than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received a free sample of Fekkai glossing shampoo and conditioner for free from BzzAgent to sample. This does not affect my review of the product.  My hair is frizzy and dry. Most hair products leave my hair dry, coarse, and dull. Fekkai&#x27;s glossing conditioner left my hair looking shiny and healthy, and less brittle than most conditioners in the price range. When I want my hair to look beautiful for special occasions, this will definitely be the shampoo/conditioner that I use.  On the negative side, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair sufficiently for everyday use, so it won&#x27;t replace my daily hair products. In addition, I was surprised to discover that neither the shampoo nor conditioner smells very good (they don&#x27;t have any scents added to cover up the shampoo/conditioner smell). These are minor complaints, and I&#x27;m going to stock up on Fekkai products to make my hair beautiful when it counts.</li>
            <li> i just love this product. my hair is softandmanageable. it also is real shinny because i buy the glossing it works on color treated hair also.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner as part of a Buzz Campaign (I&#x27;m a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!) and have been using it the last few weeks. It&#x27;s luxurious! I rarely give out 5 stars, but there&#x27;s nothing bad about this great product. From the scent to the rich texture, I feel like I&#x27;m at a salon when I use it. $22 (Target price) is more than I usually spend on shampoo/conditioner, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it everyday post-Bzz Campaign, but I know I&#x27;ll replace it when gone and will use it when I need to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> Has to be the best smelling conditioner on the planet!  Works wonders on fine, thin hair and gives incredible shine and volume. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I initially received this product as a sample from Costco and was amazed.  I already have healthy, shiny hair so I didn&#x27;t really see any major change in its \\&quot;glossiness,\\&quot; although maybe I will with continued usage. However, I have always had a dry, itchy scalp with mild dandruff that I thought I would have to live with forever--I&#x27;ve used T-Gel, Head and Shoulders, etc to no avail.  However, after just one use, I had NO dandruff.  My scalp also didn&#x27;t itch! I bought this product immediately.  I&#x27;m using the conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo, though, so I can&#x27;t necessary say which one is doing the job, but I suspect it&#x27;s both.  They&#x27;re expensive, I know, but it&#x27;s well worth it if it cures my dandruff and itchiness.  The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad by any means, but for a $80 shampoo-conditioner combo, I&#x27;d like it to smell a bit better.  I recommend this product, especially if you have scalp problems like me.</li>
            <li> Really great, lightweight moisture. Won&#x27;t weigh hair down. Great for my thick, unruly hair. I use this after a leave-in treatment and a clarifying shampoo, and the result is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and recently received my BzzKit of Fekkai glossing conditioner.  I&#x27;ve noticed my curls are conditioned, softer and have more shine.  I also put on the glossing cream which helps tame the curls. The scent is refreshing--not strong at all. I this works best when used with the glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo does more for my hair but this conditioner is a great complement.  It makes your hair soft without being to heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a Buzz marketing promotion. At first I was not sure about it because it was thicker then most conditioners. But after just 2 days I can say that I love it. It has a very light scent, and does not make my hair look oily. I think I have found my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered Fekkai.  The Glossing Shampoo, Conditioner and Cream make my hair look and feel better than it has in years.  Great products!</li>
            <li> This product is consistently great.  My daughter loves this product because it makes her hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light weight conditioner, I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Plus it makes my hair shiny</li>
            <li> Outstanding. My wife love&#x27;s this product.....</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well and leaves your hair looking shiny and super healthy.  It&#x27;s not the best smelling conditioner because it contains olive oil but definitely does the job if your looking for shiny hair.  You can buy this at Target for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have the sample pack ( shampoo, conditioner, and glossing cream).  A little of each of theses go a long way. I would be sure to use the cream cautiously around the scalp as it will look too greasy. I love this stuff.  If it does look too greasy a blowdry will help. I didn&#x27;t need to add any detaingler or leave in conditioner after and  have to be sure to rinse well. I love the smell. Kinda clean apple ish.  If you use it too many days in a row there could be a residual effect and it would be wise to do a day of regular shampoo and conditioner every few days.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and so much cheaper on amazon. It makes your hair really soft and manageable. Also adds shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for any hair product that will make my hair shiny and silky (and if it helps it stay straight, that&#x27;s a definite plus). I received a free sample of the Fekkai Glossing shampoo and conditioner and I am hooked! It is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to give me that \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; shine. As a bonus, it also helps my naturally wavy hair stay straight (after I&#x27;ve dried it straight with a hair dryer). I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair as I have after using these two products. I know it costs more than drugstore brands, and I try to be frugal when spending money, but if I find a product that does exactly what I&#x27;m looking for (and I can&#x27;t find a cheaper version) then I&#x27;ll shell out the extra money for it. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as well at any price so I&#x27;ll be buying this shampoo and conditioner again and again.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but very light. I used to use a conditioning mask daily because my hair is very dry, but this stuff feels light, rinses easily, and somehow conditions better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner . Too bad this original version is not available any more !</li>
            <li> I purchased just the conditioner (I use L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free smoothing shampoo daily to protect the color and then once a week I use Shimmer Lights to enhance my color) expecting a high-end smell but not much else--boy was I wrong! I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, just a gentle crisp clean scent. The shine was amazing! One use turned my hair into frizz-free glossy shiny hair heaven! Smoother and straighter and so so so soft. I&#x27;m a total convert...the products do matter. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair all day. Even the split ends were more tamed. I *barely* had to use any John Frieda frizz-ease, usually I have to pile it on to tame the frizzy ends. A tip for expensive products--the conditioner matters more than the shampoo, because the conditioner is what stays on longer, coats your strands, does all the work. So if you can&#x27;t afford high-end shampoo, conditioner AND styling cream...go with the conditioner. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I have thin fine hair but a high number of follicles, split ends, and highlights and lowlights. About 1/4th of my hair is virgin hair because I&#x27;m growing the dye out.</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo, this conditioner is the only hair product that leaves my hair smooth and shiny. No greasiness, no need to wash every single day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good shampoo.....i just bought becaus it&#x27;s a deal,but after using, my hair just like changed!!!! it&#x27;s amazing! make my hair smooth and shine~i love that!</li>
            <li> Try it with the shampoo..you will drop your old shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s and at last a product that gets rid of the frizz  and leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair shinning</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and I need to condition it with oil. I thought this would work well, due to rave reviews and the olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;The description claims it is made for different hair types. But my hair did not feel conditioned after use. Also, I get a much more shine with One n Only brand argan oil conditioner, which costs less.</li>
