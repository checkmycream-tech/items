    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And my optometrist&#x27;s have always said my eyes are in excellent condition whenever I come in for a checkup.  </li>
            <li>These tablets are great for removing protein build up once a week.</li>
            <li>So pricey but a great product .needs</li>
            <li>so Unizyme lovers will still have this great product</li>
            <li>My wife was happy to see her package arrive.</li>
            <li>Happy buyer</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>stuffs works great, though it may work to good cause</li>
            <li>They are superior to anything else for weekly cleaning of gas permeable contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went a couple of years without a good protein remover for my RGP (Rigid Gas Permeable) contact lenses.  </li>
            <li>I always liked to use peroxide and an Ultrazyme tab to get really good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Great product, cleans lens very quickly.</li>
            <li>I always thought they were kind of a pain to use, but nothing ever cleaned the lenses like the enzyme tablets.</li>
            <li>anyway I found this, and was thrilled</li>
            <li>hopefully Walgreens or Lobob will create their own brand version</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not an eye doctor of any kind, just a wearer of contacts who is providing my experience with lens maintenance and care.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not providing advice or anything of the kind to you.  </li>
            <li>Weekly use of this product greatly extends the life of my contacts and they are more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>just like the liquid enzymatic cleaner better.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better.</li>
            <li>more revenue generating.</li>
            <li>Most manufacturers have discontinued tablet enzymes.</li>
            <li>If the tablet enzymes disappear then many more eye infections may result.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li>I tried several enzymatic cleaners and this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>Make sure the cleaner lathers up on your fingers while cleaning them and then rinse them off with running tap water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>but it was still better than nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse well with contact solution after cleaning and before putting in your eyes.</li>
            <li>The good news is Lobob now has the exact formula and is calling it Lobob SOF/</li>
            <li>I have looked in every store for enzyme tablets to clean my contact lenses and you have them!</li>
            <li>Those were taken off the market, I imagine because rigid contact wearers are becoming fewer and fewer.  </li>
            <li>Made a huge difference, and better than any of the liquid RGP products available.</li>
            <li>Have always used these in keeping my contacts clean and eyes healthy.  </li>
            <li>Even my optometrist encouraged me to continute using them because of the health of my eyes as well as what the great condition my contacts are in, even when wearing them for double the recommended duration.  </li>
            <li>I would have to stop wearing contacts if this product was no longer available.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they gave up two great products merely because their marketing people couldn&#x27;t figure out how to find more customers for great products.  </li>
            <li>Same great quality.</li>
            <li>My lenses are clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I then take out my lenses from my eyes (only touching my face with fingers that won&#x27;t be touching the lenses!) and rinse with saline and then put them in a case containing some saline to soak a couple minutes to help loosen any grit and grime.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind saying that Unizyme is the best weekly enzymatic cleaner, and better than Clear Care and the other liquids.</li>
            <li>Before reinserting lenses in my eyes in the morning, again, clean your fingers with filmless soap, then Walgreens cleaner, and THEN handle lenses from the case, rinsing them off with saline, and then inserting in your eye(s).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, I used to use Miroflow, the best cleaner I found, for countless years as my DAILY CLEANER but Ciba Vision (CV) discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>and it really does make a difference in keeping your lenses nice and clean and clear of protein deposits - much more comfortable too by far.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product.......Could have been packed a little better....</li>
            <li>This is the most reasonable and high quality tablet enzyme available for contact lens wearers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m his only patient still using them, but the drops don&#x27;t even come close to making my contacts comfortable.</li>
            <li>However, I have always had 100% success with ordering from amazon and chose to do so again.</li>
            <li>you find something useful here.</li>
            <li>Great enzyme cleaner, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Nothing gets contact lenses as clean and feeling like new like these enzyme tablets.</li>
            <li>Love it have been looking for them for years, miss them on the shelves in the stores wish they would bring them back</li>
            <li>thank you so much Ciba Vision!  </li>
            <li>funny how they can make things disappear.....</li>
            <li>now if they stop manufacturing those lenses, we really will have a problem!</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I was wearing a pair of contacts that were already pretty shot</li>
            <li>Recently, my local drug stores stopped carrying it, probably because most people wear disposable contact lenses that do not require enzymatic cleaning.</li>
            <li>Before handling my lenses I wash my hands in two steps, first with a film-free soap (use a non-filmy dish soap).  </li>
            <li>Thanks again and please keep these babies in production ;)</li>
            <li>alternate soaking solutions through the week, either B&amp;L Biotrue or CV Clear care, but mostly with Biotrue since using a peroxide solution every day seems to make my lenses less comfortable than using the Biotrue more often.</li>
            <li>I take such good care of my lenses that I got 9 and 11 years wear out of the last two sets of soft lenses I&#x27;ve had!  </li>
            <li>This is an important product for all lens wearers especially RGP lens wearers.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.  </li>
            <li>I dont think a product that cost this much should be purchased.</li>
            <li>Savings can really add up.</li>
            <li>You will get much cleaner contacts.</li>
            <li>It works as good as the far more expensive Ulrazyme which I used before.</li>
            <li>I hope they continue to be available because the new and supposedly better products are definitely not better, they are inferior to the tablets.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and have found ythat it is very effective in cleaning both hard and soft contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I have used this product each week for about four weeks now on a new set of contact lenses and it does seem to keep them feeling like a fresh new pair.  </li>
            <li>And, obviously my prescription didn&#x27;t change significantly over those two periods of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hunch is that CV and other lens makers are slowly moving away from these extended-wear products, even though they are excellent, to force people into daily wear lenses and such, where the money seems to be better for them.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this product at various stores but have noticed recent decreasing availability.  </li>
            <li>Using these tabs is super simple and extends the life of contacts by a lot when used every week or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them anyway, assuming that if they can&#x27;t hurt soft and more fragile lenses, they hopefully will be ok to use on my hard ones.</li>
            <li>I then take out a lens and clean it with two drops of Walgreens cleaner(mentioned above) for at least 30 seconds or longer for each lens (make sure the cleaner gets lathery when using it!), then rinse off with running tap water (make sure drain is closed) to get the majority of cleaner off, then further rinse with saline before putting into your lens case/</li>
            <li>I wore and slept with them around 2 weeks before putting in new ones.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting on a new pair.</li>
            <li>They felt literally like brand new and lasted just as long, as a fresh pair, until needing to be soaked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve learned that getting sufficient sleep each night is a key factor in your eyes naturally producing the proper amounts of eye-oils to help your contacts wear comfortably through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of daily care of my lenses, here&#x27;s how I do it, in case you&#x27;re interested (those of you with \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; lenses might especially want to check this out), and since my optometrists have told me people don&#x27;t get much wear time or longevity out of their lenses.  </li>
            <li>this stuff will keep your lenses like new with that like new feeling, (actually no feeling at all &amp; crystal clear acuity)!!</li>
            <li>The enzymes keep your lens clear of bacteria that can and do lead to infections.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve never tried putting it in Clear Care</li>
            <li>I had around 14 old lenses soaking in old saline solution in one of my old lens cases.</li>
            <li>I think they just are trying to get folks to wear the soft lenses..</li>
            <li>You are fully responsible for trying my cleaning regimen above or any version of it.  </li>
            <li>I forgot I&#x27;d even used the tablets on my old lenses.</li>
            <li>I really needed to, I could cycle through the same 3 pair of disposable lenses for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>ahead to my college years and being dirt poor, I would wear my lenses until they, literally,  started popping out on their own (around a month &amp; 1/2, day and night).</li>
            <li>I know a few things about what works and doesn&#x27;t to keep them optimally clean.</li>
            <li>produce is hard to find on the shelf these days, but it really rejuvinates my contacts and extends the life.&lt;br /&gt;Arrival time was quick.</li>
            <li>I live in Mumbai, India... and wear various coloured lenses which are powered ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crucial to get as much oils and soiling removed from your fingers as possible before handling lenses.  </li>
            <li>for some background in case it helps with my credibility in the matter of lens care, I started off wearing the original hard plastic lenses in the late &#x27;60s, switched to gas permeable in the early &#x27;70s, but they kept warping, so then to soft (toric) lenses quickly after, and now, the last year, I&#x27;m in RGPs since my strong-plus prescription (11 diopters) can&#x27;t be fitted in softs any longer (two highly recommended docs tried).</li>
            <li>This is an essential product for those who wear non-disposable soft contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I just took out into the same old tablet solution to soak until I need them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tablets like these are becoming harder and harder to find, and since these kind of cleaning tablets have shockingly reduced the # of contacts I must purchase, and if there are more people that use the tablets as I do, well, the disposable lens manufacturers might not care for cleaning products such as these.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see this product as it was advertised to be for hard contacts.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble with a certain brand of 2 week disposable contact lenses having excess protein buildup.  </li>

            <li> I live in Mumbai, India... and wear various coloured lenses which are powered ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crucial to get as much oils and soiling removed from your fingers as possible before handling lenses.  </li>
            <li> for some background in case it helps with my credibility in the matter of lens care, I started off wearing the original hard plastic lenses in the late &#x27;60s, switched to gas permeable in the early &#x27;70s, but they kept warping, so then to soft (toric) lenses quickly after, and now, the last year, I&#x27;m in RGPs since my strong-plus prescription (11 diopters) can&#x27;t be fitted in softs any longer (two highly recommended docs tried).</li>
            <li> This is an essential product for those who wear non-disposable soft contact lenses.</li>
            <li> I just took out into the same old tablet solution to soak until I need them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tablets like these are becoming harder and harder to find, and since these kind of cleaning tablets have shockingly reduced the # of contacts I must purchase, and if there are more people that use the tablets as I do, well, the disposable lens manufacturers might not care for cleaning products such as these.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this product as it was advertised to be for hard contacts.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble with a certain brand of 2 week disposable contact lenses having excess protein buildup.  </li>
            <li> I would keep some old ones in saline in case something happened and was unable to get fresh ones immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Searching brought me to Unizyme - much cheaper, but also hard to find, except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I do Unizyme once a week, I put it in CV AOsept, not Clear Care.  </li>
            <li> Use it in the same cleaning process as with the other tab, no matter which one you use.  </li>
            <li> Availability limited, you have to order on line.</li>
            <li> The liquid drops....are a complete waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Just switch every 1 1/2 months with another old pair that had been soaking, (Oh, by the way, I have not noticed any negative effects to the lenses, regardless of how long they&#x27;ve soaked)</li>
            <li> The liquid daily protein removers just don&#x27;t do half the job Unizyme tablets</li>
            <li> Use with clear care 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and keep contacts soaked for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Unable to buy new ones like I was instructed, I often would keep wearing the same 3 pair over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I searched for it online and found it at amazon.com, among other places.</li>
            <li> Found this here and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> so far no matter how careful I am splitting it, half the tablet usually ends up flying across the room and a few little pieces break off.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you keep your contacts separated for each eye you have to break the tablet in half.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t found it (or any other enzymatic cleaner for that matter) in any retail store in the past year.</li>
            <li> and the tablets are not available in India  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> They want $80 for a $10 item - unbelievable.</li>
            <li> was shocked @ how clear and comfy my lenses had become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate to find these enzyme tablets because they work so well.  </li>
            <li> and it is so very difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was disappointed when I read the insert as there is nothing mentioned at all about use for gas permeable lenses.  </li>
            <li> I had cruddy, itchy contacts all that year.</li>
            <li> Its crazy!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it have been looking for them for years, miss them on the shelves in the stores wish they would bring them back</li>
            <li> These work well if you follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just like the liquid enzymatic cleaner better. It seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Thank you. I have looked in every store for enzyme tablets to clean my contact lenses and you have them! Thank you. They are superior to anything else for weekly cleaning of gas permeable contact lenses. I hope they continue to be available because the new and supposedly better products are definitely not better, they are inferior to the tablets.</li>
            <li> A must have if you wear contacts - Been using it all my life and it really does make a difference in keeping your lenses nice and clean and clear of protein deposits - much more comfortable too by far.  Once a week is all you need and it practically pay for itself in a longer lens life if you can&#x27;t wear disposables like me...this stuff will keep your lenses like new with that like new feeling, (actually no feeling at all &amp; crystal clear acuity)!!</li>
            <li> Great enzyme cleaner, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this product at various stores but have noticed recent decreasing availability.  I&#x27;ve been desperate to find these enzyme tablets because they work so well.  Even my optometrist encouraged me to continute using them because of the health of my eyes as well as what the great condition my contacts are in, even when wearing them for double the recommended duration.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m his only patient still using them, but the drops don&#x27;t even come close to making my contacts comfortable.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference, and better than any of the liquid RGP products available. If you wear RGP, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went a couple of years without a good protein remover for my RGP (Rigid Gas Permeable) contact lenses.  Then I found these on here...thank you so much Ciba Vision!  Please don&#x27;t stop production of these as they are the only type of protein remover that actually works for our lenses.  The liquid drops....are a complete waste of money!  Thanks again and please keep these babies in production ;)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wearing contacts for a while, when I finally went back to GP lenses, and when I started looking for the enzyming cleaners and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere... I was beginning to wonder... I always thought they were kind of a pain to use, but nothing ever cleaned the lenses like the enzyme tablets. I did some searches on line and found nothing... funny how they can make things disappear..... anyway I found this, and was thrilled, maybe we should be buying up all the product we can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows why these were pulled (it&#x27;s not going to make me stop using what I have) I&#x27;d like to know about it. I think they just are trying to get folks to wear the soft lenses..more revenue generating. I&#x27;ve had GP lenses that I had for over 5 years! now if they stop manufacturing those lenses, we really will have a problem!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only cleaner i trust for my gas permeable contact lenses.  It cleans well and it is so very difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is the most reasonable and high quality tablet enzyme available for contact lens wearers.  Most manufacturers have discontinued tablet enzymes. They are pushing the drops. However, I have found that the drops do not work well enough on RGP contact lens. You still need the tablets. If the tablet enzymes disappear then many more eye infections may result. The enzymes keep your lens clear of bacteria that can and do lead to infections.  Thank you Amazon for still carrying this product.  This is an important product for all lens wearers especially RGP lens wearers.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t found it (or any other enzymatic cleaner for that matter) in any retail store in the past year. Weekly use of this product greatly extends the life of my contacts and they are more comfortable to wear. Hopefully I will be able to continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> I have been searching stores for an enzymatic cleaner and figured they didn&#x27;t make them anymore until I found it on Amazon.  I used these enzyme tablets years ago but then they came out with the all-in-one no rub/cleaning/disinfectant solutions and seemed to do away with the tablets.  When I received this product, I was wearing a pair of contacts that were already pretty shot but I tried this product on them to see if it would help.  It didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.  I think the key is to use this product weekly to keep build-up off your contacts and not wait until the damage is already done.  I have used this product each week for about four weeks now on a new set of contact lenses and it does seem to keep them feeling like a fresh new pair.  My only complaint is that if you keep your contacts separated for each eye you have to break the tablet in half.  It is scored but I don&#x27;t have a pill cutter and so far no matter how careful I am splitting it, half the tablet usually ends up flying across the room and a few little pieces break off.  Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried several enzymatic cleaners and this one is the best!  My lenses are clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li> oh yeah..if u wear lenses,,,u do need to deproteinise them after every 15 wears... and regardless of what the eyewear companies tell u...the liquids dont work even 20 % as well as tablets  I live in Mumbai, India... and wear various coloured lenses which are powered ... for aesthetic looks as well as eye sight... and the tablets are not available in India  Used to search for them whenever i went abroad... and hioarded them when i found them at shops in Dubai and Singapore...   Now thankfully i can order them here.. and yes these tablets are efficient</li>
            <li> These tablets are great for removing protein build up once a week. Contact lenses are cleaner after using the tablets</li>
            <li> I have been using Unizyme for about 4  years in combination with Oxysept. It works as good as the far more expensive Ulrazyme which I used before.Plus, it is made in Switzerland rather than in a low wage country. Availability limited, you have to order on line.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for several years. Recently, my local drug stores stopped carrying it, probably because most people wear disposable contact lenses that do not require enzymatic cleaning. I searched for it online and found it at amazon.com, among other places. However, I have always had 100% success with ordering from amazon and chose to do so again.</li>
            <li> I dont think a product that cost this much should be purchased. It will run you broke if you keep buying it at the price they are offering it for. Its crazy!!!! Longs CVS has is for $11 for a box.</li>
            <li> This is an essential product for those who wear non-disposable soft contact lenses. I would have to stop wearing contacts if this product was no longer available.</li>
            <li> So pricey but a great product .needs to go back to 12 dollars per box. Just use once a week</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and have found ythat it is very effective in cleaning both hard and soft contact lenses.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this product as it was advertised to be for hard contacts.  I used to buy an enzyme tablet that was specifically for rigid gas permeable contact lenses.  Those were taken off the market, I imagine because rigid contact wearers are becoming fewer and fewer.  When I received this product I was disappointed when I read the insert as there is nothing mentioned at all about use for gas permeable lenses.  I&#x27;m using them anyway, assuming that if they can&#x27;t hurt soft and more fragile lenses, they hopefully will be ok to use on my hard ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing contact lenses since 1967.  I know a few things about what works and doesn&#x27;t to keep them optimally clean. I don&#x27;t mind saying that Unizyme is the best weekly enzymatic cleaner, and better than Clear Care and the other liquids. They just don&#x27;t get it done like Unizyme once a week does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for some background in case it helps with my credibility in the matter of lens care, I started off wearing the original hard plastic lenses in the late &#x27;60s, switched to gas permeable in the early &#x27;70s, but they kept warping, so then to soft (toric) lenses quickly after, and now, the last year, I&#x27;m in RGPs since my strong-plus prescription (11 diopters) can&#x27;t be fitted in softs any longer (two highly recommended docs tried). I take such good care of my lenses that I got 9 and 11 years wear out of the last two sets of soft lenses I&#x27;ve had!  Yes, 9 and 11 years for each pair!  And my optometrist&#x27;s have always said my eyes are in excellent condition whenever I come in for a checkup.  Point being, I&#x27;ve learned through trial and error how to take care of contact lenses over the years.  And, obviously my prescription didn&#x27;t change significantly over those two periods of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I used to use Miroflow, the best cleaner I found, for countless years as my DAILY CLEANER but Ciba Vision (CV) discontinued it.  But I thank God that Walgreens eventually started selling an identical-formula solution (it&#x27;s simply called \\&quot;Extra Strength Daily Cleaner\\&quot;), but they now seem to be out of stock. The good news is Lobob now has the exact formula and is calling it Lobob SOF/PRO2® STERILE &#x27;EXTRA STRENGTH&#x27; DAILY CLEANER, and it&#x27;s 1/3 the price that Miroflow was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now CV is also discontinuing UNIZYME, which I&#x27;ve been using for countless years as well, and hopefully Walgreens or Lobob will create their own brand version so Unizyme lovers will still have this great product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hunch is that CV and other lens makers are slowly moving away from these extended-wear products, even though they are excellent, to force people into daily wear lenses and such, where the money seems to be better for them. But I don&#x27;t know the facts on that.  I can&#x27;t believe they gave up two great products merely because their marketing people couldn&#x27;t figure out how to find more customers for great products.  But who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of daily care of my lenses, here&#x27;s how I do it, in case you&#x27;re interested (those of you with \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; lenses might especially want to check this out), and since my optometrists have told me people don&#x27;t get much wear time or longevity out of their lenses.  So here&#x27;s my details.  Before handling my lenses I wash my hands in two steps, first with a film-free soap (use a non-filmy dish soap).  Also I then wash my fingertips with 1 drop of the Walgreens (or Lobob) lens cleaner, all before handling my lenses! It&#x27;s crucial to get as much oils and soiling removed from your fingers as possible before handling lenses.  Make sure the cleaner lathers up on your fingers while cleaning them and then rinse them off with running tap water.  I then take out my lenses from my eyes (only touching my face with fingers that won&#x27;t be touching the lenses!) and rinse with saline and then put them in a case containing some saline to soak a couple minutes to help loosen any grit and grime. I then take out a lens and clean it with two drops of Walgreens cleaner(mentioned above) for at least 30 seconds or longer for each lens (make sure the cleaner gets lathery when using it!), then rinse off with running tap water (make sure drain is closed) to get the majority of cleaner off, then further rinse with saline before putting into your lens case/solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate soaking solutions through the week, either B&amp;L Biotrue or CV Clear care, but mostly with Biotrue since using a peroxide solution every day seems to make my lenses less comfortable than using the Biotrue more often. Before reinserting lenses in my eyes in the morning, again, clean your fingers with filmless soap, then Walgreens cleaner, and THEN handle lenses from the case, rinsing them off with saline, and then inserting in your eye(s). If wearing RGPs I recommend putting one drop of \\&quot;BLINK FOR CONTACTS\\&quot; solution (a brand) on each lens before inserting it.  When I do Unizyme once a week, I put it in CV AOsept, not Clear Care.  But I&#x27;ve never tried putting it in Clear Care so I don&#x27;t know what difference that makes, though I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s do-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case it needs saying, I&#x27;m not an eye doctor of any kind, just a wearer of contacts who is providing my experience with lens maintenance and care.  I&#x27;m not providing advice or anything of the kind to you.  You are fully responsible for trying my cleaning regimen above or any version of it.  I&#x27;m sure you understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve learned that getting sufficient sleep each night is a key factor in your eyes naturally producing the proper amounts of eye-oils to help your contacts wear comfortably through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you find something useful here.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with a certain brand of 2 week disposable contact lenses having excess protein buildup.  I use this product every week and it has extended the life of the contacts.</li>
            <li> Unizyme Enzymatic Cleaner Tablets-12 ct&lt;br /&gt;This produce is hard to find on the shelf these days, but it really rejuvinates my contacts and extends the life.&lt;br /&gt;Arrival time was quick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, now i can not find it&lt;br /&gt;anywhere in any store around here.</li>
            <li> I started wearing contact lenses about 25 years ago.  And I believe they were disposable as are the ones I wear now.  Though the ones I wear now are a lot softer I think.  Back then the instructions from my optometrist was to wear them 3 consecutive days, tops.  I was told to take them out whenever I slept as well.  Being 15 y/o @ the time though meant I stuck with this regiment about a month. I wore and slept with them around 2 weeks before putting in new ones. I would keep some old ones in saline in case something happened and was unable to get fresh ones immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip ahead to my college years and being dirt poor, I would wear my lenses until they, literally,  started popping out on their own (around a month &amp; 1/2, day and night). Unable to buy new ones like I was instructed, I often would keep wearing the same 3 pair over &amp; over. They got cloudier and more uncomfortable every time I re wore a pair but it was still better than nothing at all.  Although I had tried some of the liquid cleaner, which did nothing, On a hunch one day I decided to buy some of these cleaning tablets. I had around 14 old lenses soaking in old saline solution in one of my old lens cases. I threw a tablet in with them, shook em, and let them soak. About a week later, a lens I was wearing ripped. I forgot I&#x27;d even used the tablets on my old lenses. I put an tablet soaked lens in and my eye and got scared cause my eye started to burn. After a minute or 2, though, they stopped burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked @ how clear and comfy my lenses had become. They felt literally like brand new and lasted just as long, as a fresh pair, until needing to be soaked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I really needed to, I could cycle through the same 3 pair of disposable lenses for about 2 years. Just switch every 1 1/2 months with another old pair that had been soaking, (Oh, by the way, I have not noticed any negative effects to the lenses, regardless of how long they&#x27;ve soaked) I then would throw theones I just took out into the same old tablet solution to soak until I need them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuffs works great, though it may work to good cause tablets like these are becoming harder and harder to find, and since these kind of cleaning tablets have shockingly reduced the # of contacts I must purchase, and if there are more people that use the tablets as I do, well, the disposable lens manufacturers might not care for cleaning products such as these.</li>
            <li> I think Gas Perm wearers are a dying breed...but we still need our enzyme cleaner!  Found this here and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Using these tabs is super simple and extends the life of contacts by a lot when used every week or so. Savings can really add up. After cleaning (which only takes about 10 minutes) it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting on a new pair. Just be sure to rinse well with contact solution after cleaning and before putting in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Nothing gets contact lenses as clean and feeling like new like these enzyme tablets. Using them once a week makes all the difference in the feel and wear of my lenses.</li>
            <li> My wife was happy to see her package arrive. Everything went well with the purchase. Happy buyer</li>
            <li> I always liked to use peroxide and an Ultrazyme tab to get really good cleaning. Then, I couldn&#x27;t find Ultrazyme. Searching brought me to Unizyme - much cheaper, but also hard to find, except on Amazon. Same great quality. Use it in the same cleaning process as with the other tab, no matter which one you use.  You will get much cleaner contacts.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product.......Could have been packed a little better....One of the three boxes were crushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can still use all three boxes of the tablets and overall satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> Great product, cleans lens very quickly.</li>
            <li> Have always used these in keeping my contacts clean and eyes healthy.  Was having difficulty finding them in stores locally, now I have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> The liquid daily protein removers just don&#x27;t do half the job Unizyme tablets do.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else comes close. I went without Unizyme for a year until I found it online.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had cruddy, itchy contacts all that year.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Use with clear care 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and keep contacts soaked for at least 12 hours. I am using my contacts for over a year with help of this product.</li>
            <li> They want $80 for a $10 item - unbelievable.</li>
