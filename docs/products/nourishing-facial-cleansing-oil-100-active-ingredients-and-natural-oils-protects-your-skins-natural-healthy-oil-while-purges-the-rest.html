    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My skin  feels so wonderful with this.</li>
            <li>the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best to use the products together than to leave some out.  </li>
            <li>However, the cleanser itself is so wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with all the COUI Skincare products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Washing my face with this product was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>What a joy COUI Nourishing Cleansing Oil is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol I has taken a couple of months using it as directed</li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing makeup and cleaning the skin without leaving it feeling stripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the COUI Vitamin C serum after dermarolling and have really liked the product, so I was happy to try this cleansing oil in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I was happy to try another product in the COUI line as I use a combination sunscreen/moisturizer from them that I love and have been using for a year.</li>
            <li>I was provided this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>melt away even stubborn makeup, ad when followed with the right toner, get your face delightfully</li>
            <li>whether it will erase a decade of wear and tear on my face, but it does feel good and I&#x27;m sure is good for the skin considering the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a rule, I would not like to put on my skin something I cannot eat, and this sure looks edible!</li>
            <li>I had NO tightness afterwards, which I found to be amazing.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>COUI has analyzed the most up-to-date research on the benefits of plant oils (and their derivatives, glycerides) for skin, and assembled them in one facial cleansing product:  All the latest and greatest and best, together in one bottle.  </li>
            <li>When cleansing oils became popular, I was eager to try one, as I hoped it might remove dirt, cosmetics, and excess oil from my skin without stripping it.</li>
            <li>I have really liked all of the COUI products until now.  </li>
            <li>Always 100% honest.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great, refreshed and clean when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I DO NOT give good review in trade for free product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite having almond oil, rosehip etc this cleanser is very lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Reordered and much better :)</li>
            <li>I do notice a neutral &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; scent during application, but it disappears when I rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worried that adding oil to an oil-prone face would create more oiliness.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil contains five oils, two fats, and five anti-oxidants, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use many Coui  products and I love all of them.</li>
            <li>and I sure don&#x27;t want to add toxins.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleansing oil requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li>I love using this after using a scrub or mask on my face to help lock in some moisture while cleansing the skin.</li>
            <li>once I  put it on and how something that looks and feels kind of like olive oil was ever going to clean all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean, yet moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to castor, macadamia, rose hip, and other fine oils, the ingredients I am most impressed with include astaxanthin (which greatly reduces inflammation causing wrinkles), lycopene, lutein and alpha lipoic acid (all fine and natural antioxidants/nutrients).</li>
            <li>I have oily skin still and cant think that you can clean oil using oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The bottle lasted nearly three months, which IMO makes it a great cost for value, and I&#x27;ve since reordered.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not afraid to add any kind of moisture.  </li>
            <li>THis is very easy to use and rinses off easily leaving your face smooth but not oily smooth if that makes sense..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very favorably impressed with the list of natural ingredients for this product, that together provide a pleasing, healing cleansing experience that feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself with every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very nicely for overall cleansing of the face after removing most of my makeup.</li>
            <li>Cleansing oils are very much in vogue right now, and with good reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I received a sample for review, the surprisingly positive opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a lot of amazing, natural ingredients in it and the texture of my face has improved since use.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li>free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li>and I like the light</li>

            <li>[In compliance with FTC rules, I am disclosing that I received a free product for review.]</li>
            <li>amber glass bottle protects the contents from light and the formula contains carotenes and E vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 and it has helped smooth out wrinkles, plump my skin and leave my skin glowing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Received this free for review</li>
            <li>Rinsing off the oil leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>But my face feels wonderful after cleansing, more so than any other cleansing oil product I&#x27;ve tried, because this COUI oil is light and makes a very light emulsion when mixed with water in your palms as instructed.</li>
            <li>It stimulate collagen production, and that&#x27;s good against fine lines especially around</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily, too, yet leaves a fresh, moist feeling to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle efficient and comfortable cleanser I have ever</li>
            <li>My face was not feeling clean after using soap.</li>
            <li>I own several of the COUI skincare line and a Huge Fan!</li>
            <li>Finding cleansers that clean without drying can be a challenge.</li>
            <li>Guys, if you happen to see a bottle of this COUI Skincare sitting around in the bathroom, try a bit on your face, clean shaven or even those sporting the trim and neat goatees and van dykes.  </li>
            <li>and it felt clean, yet moist, but not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product are:  Castor Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, PEG-16</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find any real solution</li>
            <li>The COUI Staff are very helpful getting your regime together :)  </li>
            <li>Added to the carrier oil, castor, there is sweet almond, macadamia, sunflower, rosehip, and pomegranate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seed Oil, Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis)</li>
            <li>Seed Oil, Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis)</li>
            <li>Castor (Ricinus communis) seed oil, sweet almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis) seed oil, PEG-16</li>
            <li>Tried it on heavier bristled parts, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, but for my cheeks and neck, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to love this stuff, but I do.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you have sensitive or very dry skin but need to remove foundation at night to give your skin a chance to breathe.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you have sensitive or very dry skin but need to remove foundation at night to give your skin a chance to breathe.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s and concerns quickly.</li>
            <li>I have combo try skin but love facial oils mostly for the fact that oil combats oil, so all the sebum buildup around my nose</li>
            <li>used Coui Cleansing Oil twice a day for a week as an experiment, more often than I normally would.</li>
            <li>, I thought this seemed like an easy thing to try even though I didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a gentle way to cleanse and nourish your face, you might enjoy this</li>
            <li>This is amazing facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The Nourishing facial cleaning oil is so nice on my face.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product in exchange for a review, but this does not affect my rating or review.</li>
            <li>It foams into a lovely lather, and removes every bit of dirt and makeup, leaving the skin feeling soft and well taken care of.  </li>
            <li>Really nice facial oil that gets a lot of the impurities off.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li>far I love the moisturizing oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>product contains a number of oils (apricot, macadamia, castor, sunflower, vitamin E) and other anti-oxidant components (beta-carotene, pomegranate seed) known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>pump cap is convenient and dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  </li>
            <li>have become increasingly aware of the chemicals I am using on and what is being absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin is very dry, so this cleansing oil is probably not something I would have bought on my own.</li>
            <li>I was interested to try this product since it was oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an oil for cleansing.</li>
            <li>I actually think it also did more for getting rid of my acne than the harsher substance.</li>
            <li>Need to double cleanse though, but I was planning to do that anyway! :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m adding a star because the company is very responsive to inquiries!</li>
            <li>When I first squirted this cleanser onto my hand I was wondering how I was ever going to get it off my face with just water</li>
            <li>, I made sure not to use my pre-wash facial wipes.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is completely counterintuitive - oil shouldn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, before I put on my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, even though it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily, it feels clean but not excessively dried out.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using the cleansing oil, my face felt soothed and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>first ingredient, castor oil, is used to treat acne, dry skin, itchy skin, athlete&#x27;s foot, warts, and more.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredient list for Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil is not very long, and all ingredients are easy to identify.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredient list for Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil is not very long, and all ingredients are easy to identify.</li>
            <li>Massages and cleans out those hair follicles, keeping a soft yet firm skin - come shaving time, nice and smooth strokes.  </li>
            <li>This combination of oils removes dirt and impurities, and actually helps prevent my skin from producing too much oil during the hot, humid days of Spring and Summer down on the Gulf Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using the cleansing oil, I had been using a strong glycolic acid cleanser</li>
            <li>think this is a very cost-effective way to use under one&#x27;s eyes if one has dry skin and desires more collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my dry and sensitive skin, Coui Facial Cleansing Oil is a great choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many soaps and cleansers and they all seem to leave my face feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my face looks so much tighter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>As someone who has had oily skin all her life, how could an oil really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read that makeup doesn&#x27;t really come off all the way without an oil based cleanser</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier</li>
            <li>is now gone thanks to this cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>I wondered if it would make my skin feel clean enough afterwards.</li>
            <li>COUI has succeeded magnificently in these goals with this Nourishing Cleansing Oil, since after a week of regular use my face is softer and actually less greasy than when I&#x27;ve used other combinations of cleansers and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two full squirts is enough for one wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that bargain-priced cleansers contain fewer and less exotic oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that bargain-priced cleansers contain fewer and less exotic oils.</li>
            <li>The concept that oil dissolves oil is an interesting one, but my concern was that the product might not adequately cleanse but also might clog my pores.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that if your searching for a cleansing oil that works, COUI is the brand for you.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t normally use a cleansing oil, I read on the forum online that using a cleansing oil regimen can help get rid of sebaceous filaments on the sides of one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li>I have also been using Coui Ocean Toner and my normal serum after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I went in straight with this cleansing oil and while it didn&#x27;t get it all in the first pass, it grabbed whatever it missed on the second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great new product to add to my list for keeping time at bay . . .</li>
            <li>I may add a few drops of essential oil--rose--to go along with the Ocean Toner from COUI, which contains rose water and marine</li>
            <li>and they suggested using the product on eye make-up first, then use over the entire face.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>The natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>If you have a problem with sebaceous filaments, I would absolutely recommend trying a cleansing oil such as this one to help dissolve any oil build up clogging your skin.</li>
            <li>Well, I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and my skin was a bit sore and sensitive.</li>
            <li>So I have extremely sensitive, oily skin that tends to get so parched that it&#x27;s like rice</li>
            <li>Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is.</li>
            <li>All Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is.</li>
            <li>That added an extra step to my regimen and really was not that helpful.  </li>
            <li>Wow, a cleansing oil made from the oils of nuts and seeds.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple NOT oily.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight warming effect when you&#x27;re rubbing it together in your palms, it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular washes--it&#x27;s more of a white film, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not fond of the smell, but mercifully it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>, the various glycerides are well-known for their benefits to skin and in particular under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleansing Oil leaves my skin feeling soft and protected, not stripped, which no other cleanser has ever done.</li>
            <li>Where I would normally have 4-6 solid gushers on my face, I had two barely noticeable dots on my chin and cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now my forehead is almost free of acne, and my skin is less dry to boot!</li>
            <li>It not only cleans off all traces of makeup but it leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>(because, for us folks with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s inevitable), but it never came.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle--using it both morning and evening.</li>
            <li>This modern blend of oils and plant-derived emollients and surfactants is especially helpful for use on dry or irritated skin as a substitute for drying soaps and skin washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my past very positive experience with other COUI skin care products, I trusted their thinking in creating this gentle cleanser--that rather than aggressively strip off all the oils without properly replacing moisture in the washing process, it is possible to ensure a gentle cleansing treatment that ensures proper balance through facial washing in a way that lasts.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use Oil of Olay, or most over-the-counter sun screens for example, due to my skin reacting badly to some of the strong chemicals included in those product blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I use argan oil and rosehip oil on my face when it&#x27;s feeling dry or sensitive, I have never tried cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions--wetting my hands, my face, pumping a few squirts, and working it into my skin for a few seconds before rinsing--and my skin turned out clean and surprisingly soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>oil has a very slight medicinal smell when first applied, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A single small pump is all that is needed to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I do notice a neutral &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; scent during application, but it disappears when I rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worried that adding oil to an oil-prone face would create more oiliness.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil contains five oils, two fats, and five anti-oxidants, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use many Coui  products and I love all of them.</li>
            <li> and I sure don&#x27;t want to add toxins.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleansing oil requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> I love using this after using a scrub or mask on my face to help lock in some moisture while cleansing the skin.</li>
            <li> once I  put it on and how something that looks and feels kind of like olive oil was ever going to clean all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean, yet moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition to castor, macadamia, rose hip, and other fine oils, the ingredients I am most impressed with include astaxanthin (which greatly reduces inflammation causing wrinkles), lycopene, lutein and alpha lipoic acid (all fine and natural antioxidants/nutrients).</li>
            <li> I have oily skin still and cant think that you can clean oil using oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: The bottle lasted nearly three months, which IMO makes it a great cost for value, and I&#x27;ve since reordered.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not afraid to add any kind of moisture.  </li>
            <li> THis is very easy to use and rinses off easily leaving your face smooth but not oily smooth if that makes sense..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very favorably impressed with the list of natural ingredients for this product, that together provide a pleasing, healing cleansing experience that feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself with every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very nicely for overall cleansing of the face after removing most of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Cleansing oils are very much in vogue right now, and with good reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I received a sample for review, the surprisingly positive opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a lot of amazing, natural ingredients in it and the texture of my face has improved since use.</li>

            <li> Rinsing off the oil leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> But my face feels wonderful after cleansing, more so than any other cleansing oil product I&#x27;ve tried, because this COUI oil is light and makes a very light emulsion when mixed with water in your palms as instructed.</li>
            <li> It stimulate collagen production, and that&#x27;s good against fine lines especially around</li>
            <li> It rinses off easily, too, yet leaves a fresh, moist feeling to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle efficient and comfortable cleanser I have ever</li>
            <li> My face was not feeling clean after using soap.</li>
            <li> I own several of the COUI skincare line and a Huge Fan!</li>
            <li> Finding cleansers that clean without drying can be a challenge.</li>
            <li> Guys, if you happen to see a bottle of this COUI Skincare sitting around in the bathroom, try a bit on your face, clean shaven or even those sporting the trim and neat goatees and van dykes.  </li>
            <li> and it felt clean, yet moist, but not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are:  Castor Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, PEG-16</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to find any real solution</li>
            <li> The COUI Staff are very helpful getting your regime together :)  </li>
            <li> Added to the carrier oil, castor, there is sweet almond, macadamia, sunflower, rosehip, and pomegranate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seed Oil, Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis)</li>
            <li> Seed Oil, Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis)</li>
            <li> Castor (Ricinus communis) seed oil, sweet almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis) seed oil, PEG-16</li>
            <li> Tried it on heavier bristled parts, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, but for my cheeks and neck, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to love this stuff, but I do.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you have sensitive or very dry skin but need to remove foundation at night to give your skin a chance to breathe.</li>

            <li> &#x27;s and concerns quickly.</li>
            <li> I have combo try skin but love facial oils mostly for the fact that oil combats oil, so all the sebum buildup around my nose</li>
            <li> used Coui Cleansing Oil twice a day for a week as an experiment, more often than I normally would.</li>
            <li> , I thought this seemed like an easy thing to try even though I didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a gentle way to cleanse and nourish your face, you might enjoy this</li>
            <li> This is amazing facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The Nourishing facial cleaning oil is so nice on my face.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product in exchange for a review, but this does not affect my rating or review.</li>
            <li> It foams into a lovely lather, and removes every bit of dirt and makeup, leaving the skin feeling soft and well taken care of.  </li>
            <li> Really nice facial oil that gets a lot of the impurities off.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> far I love the moisturizing oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> product contains a number of oils (apricot, macadamia, castor, sunflower, vitamin E) and other anti-oxidant components (beta-carotene, pomegranate seed) known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li> pump cap is convenient and dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  </li>
            <li> have become increasingly aware of the chemicals I am using on and what is being absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin is very dry, so this cleansing oil is probably not something I would have bought on my own.</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this product since it was oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an oil for cleansing.</li>
            <li> I actually think it also did more for getting rid of my acne than the harsher substance.</li>
            <li> Need to double cleanse though, but I was planning to do that anyway! :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m adding a star because the company is very responsive to inquiries!</li>
            <li> When I first squirted this cleanser onto my hand I was wondering how I was ever going to get it off my face with just water</li>
            <li> , I made sure not to use my pre-wash facial wipes.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is completely counterintuitive - oil shouldn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, before I put on my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, even though it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily, it feels clean but not excessively dried out.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using the cleansing oil, my face felt soothed and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> first ingredient, castor oil, is used to treat acne, dry skin, itchy skin, athlete&#x27;s foot, warts, and more.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredient list for Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil is not very long, and all ingredients are easy to identify.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredient list for Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil is not very long, and all ingredients are easy to identify.</li>
            <li> Massages and cleans out those hair follicles, keeping a soft yet firm skin - come shaving time, nice and smooth strokes.  </li>
            <li> This combination of oils removes dirt and impurities, and actually helps prevent my skin from producing too much oil during the hot, humid days of Spring and Summer down on the Gulf Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using the cleansing oil, I had been using a strong glycolic acid cleanser</li>
            <li> think this is a very cost-effective way to use under one&#x27;s eyes if one has dry skin and desires more collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my dry and sensitive skin, Coui Facial Cleansing Oil is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many soaps and cleansers and they all seem to leave my face feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face looks so much tighter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> As someone who has had oily skin all her life, how could an oil really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read that makeup doesn&#x27;t really come off all the way without an oil based cleanser</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier</li>
            <li> is now gone thanks to this cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> I wondered if it would make my skin feel clean enough afterwards.</li>
            <li> COUI has succeeded magnificently in these goals with this Nourishing Cleansing Oil, since after a week of regular use my face is softer and actually less greasy than when I&#x27;ve used other combinations of cleansers and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two full squirts is enough for one wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that bargain-priced cleansers contain fewer and less exotic oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that bargain-priced cleansers contain fewer and less exotic oils.</li>
            <li> The concept that oil dissolves oil is an interesting one, but my concern was that the product might not adequately cleanse but also might clog my pores.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that if your searching for a cleansing oil that works, COUI is the brand for you.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t normally use a cleansing oil, I read on the forum online that using a cleansing oil regimen can help get rid of sebaceous filaments on the sides of one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> I have also been using Coui Ocean Toner and my normal serum after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I went in straight with this cleansing oil and while it didn&#x27;t get it all in the first pass, it grabbed whatever it missed on the second.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great new product to add to my list for keeping time at bay . . .</li>
            <li> I may add a few drops of essential oil--rose--to go along with the Ocean Toner from COUI, which contains rose water and marine</li>
            <li> and they suggested using the product on eye make-up first, then use over the entire face.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> The natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> If you have a problem with sebaceous filaments, I would absolutely recommend trying a cleansing oil such as this one to help dissolve any oil build up clogging your skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and my skin was a bit sore and sensitive.</li>
            <li> So I have extremely sensitive, oily skin that tends to get so parched that it&#x27;s like rice</li>
            <li> Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is.</li>
            <li> All Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is.</li>
            <li> That added an extra step to my regimen and really was not that helpful.  </li>
            <li> Wow, a cleansing oil made from the oils of nuts and seeds.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple NOT oily.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight warming effect when you&#x27;re rubbing it together in your palms, it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular washes--it&#x27;s more of a white film, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not fond of the smell, but mercifully it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> , the various glycerides are well-known for their benefits to skin and in particular under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleansing Oil leaves my skin feeling soft and protected, not stripped, which no other cleanser has ever done.</li>
            <li> Where I would normally have 4-6 solid gushers on my face, I had two barely noticeable dots on my chin and cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now my forehead is almost free of acne, and my skin is less dry to boot!</li>
            <li> It not only cleans off all traces of makeup but it leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> (because, for us folks with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s inevitable), but it never came.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle--using it both morning and evening.</li>
            <li> This modern blend of oils and plant-derived emollients and surfactants is especially helpful for use on dry or irritated skin as a substitute for drying soaps and skin washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on my past very positive experience with other COUI skin care products, I trusted their thinking in creating this gentle cleanser--that rather than aggressively strip off all the oils without properly replacing moisture in the washing process, it is possible to ensure a gentle cleansing treatment that ensures proper balance through facial washing in a way that lasts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Oil of Olay, or most over-the-counter sun screens for example, due to my skin reacting badly to some of the strong chemicals included in those product blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I use argan oil and rosehip oil on my face when it&#x27;s feeling dry or sensitive, I have never tried cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions--wetting my hands, my face, pumping a few squirts, and working it into my skin for a few seconds before rinsing--and my skin turned out clean and surprisingly soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> oil has a very slight medicinal smell when first applied, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A single small pump is all that is needed to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor, and other books</li>
            <li> It is dry in the sense that it has very little natural barrier, loses moisture fast, and will dry out like paper, producing cracks and fine lines if I wash it too often or expose it to wind or dry air.</li>
            <li> Usually, after showering, I can see the little white dots on my face, but in the last few days since I have been doing this, I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all, which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds up like other cleansers and I usually add a little more to my hand to cleans off the eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I leave it there for a few minutes in the shower, then wash my face as normal and move on with my day.</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no negative skin reactions, and my skin looks and feels soft and hydrated with a subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has dry and oily sections and although, as the year’s pass, it is getting drier, an occasional blemish can still form.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get the weird dry skin feeling that happens with most other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just be extra careful when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no identifiable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a pale yellow color and a faint nutty odor with a hint of the more vegetal rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my face tends toward being slightly oily, and I have sensitive skin, I am extremely cautious about which skin products I use.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry.</li>
            <li> With some cleansers I can feel my skin start to dry as I use the brush, this just kept the soothing feeling</li>
            <li> Dirt, make-up, and excess oil are removed without leaving skin dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have skin that&#x27;s on the dry side lately(age-related)</li>
            <li> And, I appreciate the fact that the pump dispenses just a small amount at a time rather than a large spurt that might unnecessarily waste the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I had dry skin as a teenager!</li>
            <li> Long due</li>
            <li> Typically, washing too frequently causes me to have uneven skin tone, but there has not been any hint of that with the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> Typically, washing too frequently causes me to have uneven skin tone, but there has not been any hint of that with the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a drop and a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> A little dab is all you need, which means the bottle will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using  the cleanser in the shower with wet hands</li>
            <li> Rinse with water or a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the product instructions I applied a few drops to the palms of my wet hands and rubbed them together until a white film appeared, which I then applied to my wet face.</li>
            <li> I received this a few months back for review purposes and have not stopped using it since.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with acne on my forehead, just small bumps that won&#x27;t go away with normal cleansing washes.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was totally wrong!</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> so I am trying to keep it simple by switching to natural products with as few additives, artificial colors and fragrances as possible on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Squirt the oil onto wet hands, rub palms together until a whitish film or subtle later is produced, then massage into your face.</li>
            <li> The COUI has a slight edge because it turns creamier</li>
            <li> Oil should push dirt into my face and not clean it.</li>
            <li> I just put a little dab of this cleansing oil over the areas where I have problems with sebaceous filaments (little plugged ducts in my skin).</li>
            <li> it would be the glass container and little plastic lid.</li>
            <li> few pumps from the bottle gives you a combination of oils in the palm of your hand, which turns into a milky emollient with a bit of water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only become worse as I age.</li>
            <li> I got a CVS brand benzyl peroxide wash which was so harsh on my skin that even though it was sort of working for the acne, it dried up my skin.</li>
            <li> few drops of the oil should be massaged into the skin and then rinsed thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It even helps remove excess makeup left behind by remover wipes.</li>
            <li> bottle has a convenient pump, and takes up very little space on the vanity.  </li>
            <li> so the lid was hard to get off, then I am just not comfortable using glass in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I was not sure about getting another Oil.</li>
            <li> The cleansing oil does a lousy job of removing make-up, especially eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is painful, stressed, and ghastly-looking if I wash it every day.</li>
            <li> And I can only use glycerin-based soaps or cleansers, as all others leave a film on my skin that is painful.</li>
            <li> My skin has not been dry, irritated, stressed, or painful in this time.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my acne worse; surface oil has no effect on acne.</li>
            <li> Well how wrong could I be?</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong..</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of a product called &amp;#34;cleansing oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Figured the worst that would happen would be my face exploding in a mess of pimples and looking like Quasimodo for a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried &amp;#34;oil cleansing&amp;#34; before with disastrous results, but I&#x27;m an eternal optimist, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> No oil should leave my face feeling greasy and nasty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  I&#x27;ve tried many soaps and cleansers and they all seem to leave my face feeling very dry.  I was interested to try this product since it was oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It leaves my skin feeling very clean, yet moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients.  The ingredients in this product are:  Castor Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, PEG-10 Sunflower Glycerides, Tocotrienols, Alpha-D-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Astaxanthin, Lycopene, Lutein, Alpha-Lipoic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a very slight medicinal smell when first applied, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gentle way to cleanse and nourish your face, you might enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li> What a joy COUI Nourishing Cleansing Oil is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my face tends toward being slightly oily, and I have sensitive skin, I am extremely cautious about which skin products I use. I can&#x27;t use Oil of Olay, or most over-the-counter sun screens for example, due to my skin reacting badly to some of the strong chemicals included in those product blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my past very positive experience with other COUI skin care products, I trusted their thinking in creating this gentle cleanser--that rather than aggressively strip off all the oils without properly replacing moisture in the washing process, it is possible to ensure a gentle cleansing treatment that ensures proper balance through facial washing in a way that lasts. COUI has succeeded magnificently in these goals with this Nourishing Cleansing Oil, since after a week of regular use my face is softer and actually less greasy than when I&#x27;ve used other combinations of cleansers and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very favorably impressed with the list of natural ingredients for this product, that together provide a pleasing, healing cleansing experience that feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself with every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I use the COUI Vitamin C serum after dermarolling and have really liked the product, so I was happy to try this cleansing oil in return for an honest review. As some others mentioned, it took forever to prime the pump to get anything out of the bottle, but once it started working, it kept working well. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin is very dry, so this cleansing oil is probably not something I would have bought on my own. But my face feels wonderful after cleansing, more so than any other cleansing oil product I&#x27;ve tried, because this COUI oil is light and makes a very light emulsion when mixed with water in your palms as instructed. It rinses off easily, too, yet leaves a fresh, moist feeling to the skin. I like it!</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t normally use a cleansing oil, I read on the forum online that using a cleansing oil regimen can help get rid of sebaceous filaments on the sides of one&#x27;s nose. Given that this is an issue I have and I haven&#x27;t been able to find any real solution, I thought this seemed like an easy thing to try even though I didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work. Fortunately, I was totally wrong! I just put a little dab of this cleansing oil over the areas where I have problems with sebaceous filaments (little plugged ducts in my skin). I leave it there for a few minutes in the shower, then wash my face as normal and move on with my day. Usually, after showering, I can see the little white dots on my face, but in the last few days since I have been doing this, I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all, which is absolutely amazing. If you have a problem with sebaceous filaments, I would absolutely recommend trying a cleansing oil such as this one to help dissolve any oil build up clogging your skin. Though I received a sample for review, the surprisingly positive opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is completely counterintuitive - oil shouldn&#x27;t clean. No oil should leave my face feeling greasy and nasty. Oil should push dirt into my face and not clean it. Well how wrong could I be? This is the most gentle efficient and comfortable cleanser I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a drop and a little bit of water. My skin  feels so wonderful with this. I can see the dirt being lifted and removed from my skin. Rinsing off the oil leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth. I love the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is perfect. A single small pump is all that is needed to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> Cleansing oils are very much in vogue right now, and with good reason.&lt;br /&gt;They melt away even stubborn makeup, ad when followed with the right toner, get your face delightfully clean.&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are this COUI product and one from L&#x27;Occitaine. The COUI has a slight edge because it turns creamier and I like the light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> Upate 1/4: Same as the C Serum. I ran out, stopped using. My face was not feeling clean after using soap. Reordered and much better :) Best to use the products together than to leave some out.  I purchased this product based on the advise of COUI and could not be happier!  A while back a different company sent me a sample and it was So oily. A friend of mine couldnt wash it off so I was not sure about getting another Oil. I have oily skin still and cant think that you can clean oil using oil! THis is very easy to use and rinses off easily leaving your face smooth but not oily smooth if that makes sense.. I use it before applying the Vitamin C Serum and 3 times a week the Exfoliating Serum. You cannot go wrong.. The COUI Staff are very helpful getting your regime together :)  Update: Long due but I have found using this item and the Vitamin C Serum 20% my face looks so much tighter. Friends have asked me if I had Juvederm etc lol I has taken a couple of months using it as directed but I am very pleased and will continue to buy. THe staff is SO helpful and answered ?&#x27;s and concerns quickly.</li>
            <li> COUI has analyzed the most up-to-date research on the benefits of plant oils (and their derivatives, glycerides) for skin, and assembled them in one facial cleansing product:  All the latest and greatest and best, together in one bottle.  Added to the carrier oil, castor, there is sweet almond, macadamia, sunflower, rosehip, and pomegranate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few pumps from the bottle gives you a combination of oils in the palm of your hand, which turns into a milky emollient with a bit of water.  It cleanses my face and protects it at the same time.  It feels soothing and smoothing when I work it into my skin, and it rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance added.  I do notice a neutral &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; scent during application, but it disappears when I rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worried that adding oil to an oil-prone face would create more oiliness.  No, that is not the case.  This combination of oils removes dirt and impurities, and actually helps prevent my skin from producing too much oil during the hot, humid days of Spring and Summer down on the Gulf Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.  I may add a few drops of essential oil--rose--to go along with the Ocean Toner from COUI, which contains rose water and marine kelp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from COUI Skincare.</li>
            <li> This Facical Cleaning Oil is High-Quality, Gentile and Irritant Free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy and removes even stubborn makeup I highly recommend that if your searching for a cleansing oil that works, COUI is the brand for you. I own several of the COUI skincare line and a Huge Fan!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b2a6f826aeff33b360766d81afe779ba]] This was my first time using an oil for cleansing. It works very nicely for overall cleansing of the face after removing most of my makeup. I was happy to try another product in the COUI line as I use a combination sunscreen/moisturizer from them that I love and have been using for a year. I was provided this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See attached video for demonstration of using the cleansing oil, as well as its ingredients and directions for use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Coui Vitamin C Serum so when I was offered an opportunity to try the Coui Cleansing Oil, I thought why not. Although I use argan oil and rosehip oil on my face when it&#x27;s feeling dry or sensitive, I have never tried cleansing oil. I wondered if it would make my skin feel clean enough afterwards. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. Coui Facial Cleansing Oil removed my face makeup and cleansed my skin without stripping it. Prior to using the cleansing oil, I had been using a strong glycolic acid cleanser and my skin was a bit sore and sensitive. After a few days of using the cleansing oil, my face felt soothed and much more comfortable. For my dry and sensitive skin, Coui Facial Cleansing Oil is a great choice.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry. I had dry skin as a teenager! It&#x27;s only become worse as I age. Finding cleansers that clean without drying can be a challenge. The Nourishing facial cleaning oil is so nice on my face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, before I put on my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite having almond oil, rosehip etc this cleanser is very lightly scented.  It also worked well with my cleansing brush. With some cleansers I can feel my skin start to dry as I use the brush, this just kept the soothing feeling going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one issue it would be the glass container and little plastic lid. I am using  the cleanser in the shower with wet hands so the lid was hard to get off, then I am just not comfortable using glass in the shower. However, the cleanser itself is so wonderful I&#x27;ll just be extra careful when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for testing and evaluation</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have trouble with acne on my forehead, just small bumps that won&#x27;t go away with normal cleansing washes. I got a CVS brand benzyl peroxide wash which was so harsh on my skin that even though it was sort of working for the acne, it dried up my skin. I started alternating with this wash, and it did wonders for my skin. I actually think it also did more for getting rid of my acne than the harsher substance. Now my forehead is almost free of acne, and my skin is less dry to boot! Also, even though it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily, it feels clean but not excessively dried out. I highly recommend this product! I received a complimentary product in exchange for a review, but this does not affect my rating or review.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is painful, stressed, and ghastly-looking if I wash it every day. As a result, I haven&#x27;t washed my face every day since I was a teenager. That solves the problems, but I can&#x27;t sport the fresh-faced look every day. When cleansing oils became popular, I was eager to try one, as I hoped it might remove dirt, cosmetics, and excess oil from my skin without stripping it. Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil contains five oils, two fats, and five anti-oxidants, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. It comes in a 2 fl oz (60 ml) glass pump bottle. Two full squirts is enough for one wash. Squirt the oil onto wet hands, rub palms together until a whitish film or subtle later is produced, then massage into your face. You don&#x27;t need much. Rinse with water or a wet wash cloth. Dirt, make-up, and excess oil are removed without leaving skin dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Coui Cleansing Oil twice a day for a week as an experiment, more often than I normally would. My skin has not been dry, irritated, stressed, or painful in this time. In fact, it has the smoothest texture ever. I have also been using Coui Ocean Toner and my normal serum after cleansing. But I am amazed that I can wash my face this often without wrecking my skin. My skin is oily in the sense that I have always had moderate acne. It is dry in the sense that it has very little natural barrier, loses moisture fast, and will dry out like paper, producing cracks and fine lines if I wash it too often or expose it to wind or dry air. Moisturizers do not help this, though some serums do. And I can only use glycerin-based soaps or cleansers, as all others leave a film on my skin that is painful. So I have extremely sensitive, oily skin that tends to get so parched that it&#x27;s like rice paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coui Cleansing Oil leaves my skin feeling soft and protected, not stripped, which no other cleanser has ever done. It hasn&#x27;t made my acne worse; surface oil has no effect on acne. And I can get that fresh-faced look any time I want. Typically, washing too frequently causes me to have uneven skin tone, but there has not been any hint of that with the cleansing oil. I obviously should have tried cleansing oil sooner. This is perfect if you have sensitive or very dry skin but need to remove foundation at night to give your skin a chance to breathe. Go ahead and cleanse. It won&#x27;t dry out your skin. There are a lot of cleansing oils on the market. Coui seems to be priced in the middle, between the bargain and the boutique brands. I&#x27;ve noticed that bargain-priced cleansers contain fewer and less exotic oils. Coui is intended to be a high-end product at moderate cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is. I like that the ingredient list for Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil is not very long, and all ingredients are easy to identify. It saves me having to look a lot of stuff up. Ingredients are: Castor (Ricinus communis) Seed Oil, Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis) Seed Oil, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, PEG-10 Sunflower Glycerides, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate (surfactant), Rosehip Seed (Rosa affinis rubiginosa) Oil, Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Seed Oil, Tocotrienols, Alpha-D-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Astaxanthin, Lycopene, Lutein, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta Carotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[In compliance with FTC rules, I am disclosing that I received a free product for review.]h-faced look any time I want.

            <li> I was a bit skeptical of a product called &amp;#34;cleansing oil&amp;#34;.  As someone who has had oily skin all her life, how could an oil really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, just as promised!  It foams into a lovely lather, and removes every bit of dirt and makeup, leaving the skin feeling soft and well taken care of.  A pleasure to use, it&#x27;s an end of the day luxury.  A little dab is all you need, which means the bottle will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a convenient pump, and takes up very little space on the vanity.  I&#x27;m very impressed with all the COUI Skincare products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> Really nice facial oil that gets a lot of the impurities off. Need to double cleanse though, but I was planning to do that anyway! :)</li>
            <li> I have really liked all of the COUI products until now.  The cleansing oil does a lousy job of removing make-up, especially eye make-up.  I e-mailed the company and they suggested using the product on eye make-up first, then use over the entire face.  That added an extra step to my regimen and really was not that helpful.  I still had to use extra products to remove the last bit of make-up.  Also, my skin reacted to the product by breaking out around my mouth and chin. So I will continue to use the COUI serums but this one goes in the trash!  I would give this product one star but I&#x27;m adding a star because the company is very responsive to inquiries!</li>
            <li> The Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans used olive oil to cleanse the skin before bathing.  This modern blend of oils and plant-derived emollients and surfactants is especially helpful for use on dry or irritated skin as a substitute for drying soaps and skin washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pale yellow color and a faint nutty odor with a hint of the more vegetal rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops of the oil should be massaged into the skin and then rinsed thoroughly.  It does a good job of removing makeup and cleaning the skin without leaving it feeling stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber glass bottle protects the contents from light and the formula contains carotenes and E vitamins.  The date of manufacture is printed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump cap is convenient and dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Castor (Ricinus communis) seed oil, sweet almond (Prunus amygdalus dulcis) seed oil, PEG-16 macadamia glycerides, PEG-10 sunflower glycerides, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, rosehip seed (Rosa affinis rubiginosa) oil, pomegranate seed (Punica granatum) oil, tocotrienols, alpha-d-tocopherol (vitamin E), astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, alpha lipoic acid, beta carotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COUI provided cleansing oil for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> It smells rancid and made my face break out.</li>
            <li> When I first squirted this cleanser onto my hand I was wondering how I was ever going to get it off my face with just water once I  put it on and how something that looks and feels kind of like olive oil was ever going to clean all the makeup off.  Boy was I surprised!  It not only cleans off all traces of makeup but it leaves your skin so soft.  You won&#x27;t get the weird dry skin feeling that happens with most other cleansers.  And, your skin isn&#x27;t oily either.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up like other cleansers and I usually add a little more to my hand to cleans off the eye makeup.  (Probably don&#x27;t even  need to do that) I will purchase this product again.  I use many Coui  products and I love all of them.</li>
            <li> This is amazing facial cleanser. I read that makeup doesn&#x27;t really come off all the way without an oil based cleanser so I did some research and chose this one based on reviews and ingredients. I love that it has a lot of amazing, natural ingredients in it and the texture of my face has improved since use.</li>
            <li> Wow, a cleansing oil made from the oils of nuts and seeds. I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier and I sure don&#x27;t want to add toxins. As a rule, I would not like to put on my skin something I cannot eat, and this sure looks edible! In addition to castor, macadamia, rose hip, and other fine oils, the ingredients I am most impressed with include astaxanthin (which greatly reduces inflammation causing wrinkles), lycopene, lutein and alpha lipoic acid (all fine and natural antioxidants/nutrients). My skin feels great, refreshed and clean when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor, and other books</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be without this. Love it</li>
            <li> Guys, if you happen to see a bottle of this COUI Skincare sitting around in the bathroom, try a bit on your face, clean shaven or even those sporting the trim and neat goatees and van dykes.  Massages and cleans out those hair follicles, keeping a soft yet firm skin - come shaving time, nice and smooth strokes.  Tried it on heavier bristled parts, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, but for my cheeks and neck, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a fan of this line of skin care and have been buying their Vit. C serum for about a year, so when they asked me to try another product, I was totally onboard.  I&#x27;ve never cleansed with an oil, but I do use oils for on my skin so I thought why not?  This oil is wonderful. I have skin that&#x27;s on the dry side lately(age-related) so I&#x27;m not afraid to add any kind of moisture.  Washing my face with this product was wonderful.  I had NO tightness afterwards, which I found to be amazing. I&#x27;ve only started using it so I can&#x27;t whether it will erase a decade of wear and tear on my face, but it does feel good and I&#x27;m sure is good for the skin considering the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil(which is something Edgar Cayce is alway recommending)&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond oil&lt;br /&gt;Macadamia glycerides&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower glycerides . . . vitamin E, alpha Lipoid acid and beta carotene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great new product to add to my list for keeping time at bay . . .</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried an oil-based cleanser on my skin, so I was not sure what to expect. My skin has dry and oily sections and although, as the year’s pass, it is getting drier, an occasional blemish can still form. The concept that oil dissolves oil is an interesting one, but my concern was that the product might not adequately cleanse but also might clog my pores. I had to try it to see, but my concerns proved to be unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the product instructions I applied a few drops to the palms of my wet hands and rubbed them together until a white film appeared, which I then applied to my wet face. After gently massaging the oil around my face and eyes, I rinsed and dried my face and it felt clean, yet moist, but not at all greasy. And, I appreciate the fact that the pump dispenses just a small amount at a time rather than a large spurt that might unnecessarily waste the cleansing oil. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains a number of oils (apricot, macadamia, castor, sunflower, vitamin E) and other anti-oxidant components (beta-carotene, pomegranate seed) known to be good for the skin. There is no identifiable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become increasingly aware of the chemicals I am using on and what is being absorbed into my skin. I am not a chemist so I am trying to keep it simple by switching to natural products with as few additives, artificial colors and fragrances as possible on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love the moisturizing oil cleanser. I have had absolutely no negative skin reactions, and my skin looks and feels soft and hydrated with a subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample provided without any obligation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any skin product like this before and nothing with castor oil. I had no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient, castor oil, is used to treat acne, dry skin, itchy skin, athlete&#x27;s foot, warts, and more. It stimulate collagen production, and that&#x27;s good against fine lines especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the various glycerides are well-known for their benefits to skin and in particular under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a very cost-effective way to use under one&#x27;s eyes if one has dry skin and desires more collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing oil requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> I love using this after using a scrub or mask on my face to help lock in some moisture while cleansing the skin. I received this a few months back for review purposes and have not stopped using it since. It even helps remove excess makeup left behind by remover wipes. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried &amp;#34;oil cleansing&amp;#34; before with disastrous results, but I&#x27;m an eternal optimist, so I decided to give this a try. Figured the worst that would happen would be my face exploding in a mess of pimples and looking like Quasimodo for a week. That, however, did not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delight and surprise, this stuff worked. I followed the instructions--wetting my hands, my face, pumping a few squirts, and working it into my skin for a few seconds before rinsing--and my skin turned out clean and surprisingly soft to the touch. I did this for a solid two weeks, morning and night, waiting patiently for the breakout to occur (because, for us folks with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s inevitable), but it never came. In fact, something *else* happened--my regular hormonal breakout was lessened. Where I would normally have 4-6 solid gushers on my face, I had two barely noticeable dots on my chin and cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, I figured it would tank the makeup removal test when it rolled around. I got all dolled up in my mineral makeup, eyeliner, mascara, and shadow, and at the end of the evening when it was time to wash it all off, I made sure not to use my pre-wash facial wipes. I went in straight with this cleansing oil and while it didn&#x27;t get it all in the first pass, it grabbed whatever it missed on the second. Even my waterproof eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle--using it both morning and evening. Two pumps is enough to wash my entire face. It has a slight warming effect when you&#x27;re rubbing it together in your palms, it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular washes--it&#x27;s more of a white film, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not fond of the smell, but mercifully it doesn&#x27;t linger. I really didn&#x27;t want to love this stuff, but I do. Should anything change as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sample provided for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The bottle lasted nearly three months, which IMO makes it a great cost for value, and I&#x27;ve since reordered. This is now one of my favourite cleansers.st for value, and I&#x27;ve since reordered. This is now one of my favourite cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of facial oil forever. I have combo try skin but love facial oils mostly for the fact that oil combats oil, so all the sebum buildup around my nose is now gone thanks to this cleansing oil.  It leaves my skin soft and supple NOT oily.  I am 45 and it has helped smooth out wrinkles, plump my skin and leave my skin glowing.  People stop me all the time and ask me what face makeup I have on, when I tell them none, they are amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this free for review but I DO NOT give good review in trade for free product.  Always 100% honest.  See my review here: https://youtu.be/kxICTF51P3U</li>
