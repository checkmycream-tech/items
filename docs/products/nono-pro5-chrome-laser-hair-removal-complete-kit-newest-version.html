    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this!</li>
            <li>The advertising said it leaves you with no stubble, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair to say</li>
            <li>Awesome my girl never looked so smooth</li>
            <li>when I give the product four stars (three-and-a-half may be better), it&#x27;s because the NoNo!</li>
            <li>I bought three more for my sisters for Christmas!</li>
            <li>easy to use, results are great</li>
            <li>just to get a thinning of the hair is nice.</li>
            <li>Wow this product is awesome and it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than waxing.</li>
            <li>In the end, for the amount of time/money you have to invest, I think that most people will probably prefer to stick to shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>With this I was able to use it on any area I wanted to and saved me a lot of money and time.</li>
            <li>have something way better anyway.</li>
            <li>I guess it is Ok,</li>
            <li>Probably take time to really get experienced.</li>
            <li>This is the most fantastic price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Really, it does not do a good job at all.</li>
            <li>And easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called a lighter and fine grit sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I guess this device was meant for fine peach fuzz for even our fine hair was no match for this misleading product.</li>
            <li>Its claims to give &amp;#34;quick, silky, smooth, hair free results&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Pro 5 is a decent fit for me... but may not be a fit for most, depending on your needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>Followed directions to clean and now does not work.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more effective at permanenty removing hair, as of now it just burns the top hair off and needs to be repeated when stubble reappears in a few days.  </li>
            <li>Fast!!</li>
            <li>I also found the company very accommodating by sending me (for free)</li>
            <li>I hope this review gives an objective assessment of this seemingly controversial product.</li>
            <li>But, I do find that I have to pass over and over the same areas to remove the hair during each treatment... which is much more than the &amp;#34;three</li>
            <li>After the first use I called to return it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Pro 3 and then upgraded after a few months to the more powerful Pro 5.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend it to most people, because I just don&#x27;t think most would tolerate the slow, gradual results for the time/money</li>
            <li>Maybe with long term use it will give me better results.</li>
            <li>I think the only hair it will take off is the fine arm hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as I expected.</li>
            <li>Others have said that you get much faster results on &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hair, but as I guy, I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was a reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this works.</li>
            <li>This is very upsetting</li>
            <li>We let it over 5, 8 and 24 hours charging and yet the battery icon never reached the full status (only one bar)</li>
            <li>The only downside is the smell when in use but that quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>but I have seen enough positive results in thinning the hair over the months that it gives me the determination to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I used the ones I had from my old depilatory. )  </li>
            <li>Product did not perform anywhere near description.</li>
            <li>The insert used to singe the hair tips lacks the tensile strength to last more than a few passes over hairy areas,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, contrary to others&#x27; experiences, I have found the replacement tips to last pretty long... about 4 to 6 weeks each, using it twice a week for a total of one hour per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend sticking to small areas that are more manageable and less time-consuming to treat.</li>

            <li> We both tried this device on different areas of our body that had fine to coarse hair and it utterly fails each and every time.</li>
            <li> This works just like the expensive professional electrolysis just not quite as powerful.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really hard not to burn yourself, especially your face and underarms which were the main reason I got it.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with that little extra &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; that you want removed this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I will keep using it though because waxing is more painful</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> the larger replacement tips when I had complained that the smaller tips I bought were too small for</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman wanting silky smooth legs or underarms after each treatment, again, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> And mine would get stuck and just stay on all the time after about 5 minutes of use would have to move the little roller to get it off.</li>
            <li> When we recieved it, 2 of the 3 heads were broken and a half hour into using it the 3rd one broke.</li>
            <li> , after each treatment your skin is smooth-ish, but not *perfectly* smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this  for my chin area have a few of those pesky stiff hair that just have to grow there.</li>
            <li> Came with stuff missing and other things broken</li>
            <li> Also the head seemed to go bad after only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money ! !</li>
            <li> I even gave it another week of use with max power setting on my arm hair and all it did was singe my skin while leaving all the hair behind.</li>
            <li> FALSE.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the treatments can be really tedious...</li>
            <li> Bought the NoNo for both my wife and I to use and sad to say but we are highly disappointed in this device.</li>
            <li> If you think that after a month or two that you will be hair-free, then you will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This literally doesn&#x27;t do crap.</li>
            <li> Worthless product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow this product is awesome and it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than waxing. This is the most fantastic price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.I ordered this  for my chin area have a few of those pesky stiff hair that just have to grow there. Tried the no no  and still have the hair it would not get rid of them at all. So tried it on my legs same there still hair it will make the hair shorter but not gone I think the only hair it will take off is the fine arm hair. And mine would get stuck and just stay on all the time after about 5 minutes of use would have to move the little roller to get it off. Anyway sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Patience is the key.  Use twice a day on really coarse hair.  Follow directions and USE A SOOTHING CREAM.  (I used the ones I had from my old depilatory. )  I&#x27;m loving this!</li>
            <li> Product did not perform anywhere near description. Also the head seemed to go bad after only a few minutes. Seller did refund purchase price but not my return shipping costs.</li>
            <li> Did never work, we couldn&#x27;t find out if it is related to the charger or the device itself. We let it over 5, 8 and 24 hours charging and yet the battery icon never reached the full status (only one bar) In the USA our electricity power is of 110 V only.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway we would like to return it and ask for refund or receive another product in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Leila</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The insert used to singe the hair tips lacks the tensile strength to last more than a few passes over hairy areas,&lt;br /&gt;most especially if you have course hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> much more difficult to use than advertised</li>
            <li> Really, it does not do a good job at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one year now. I am a man using it on upper arms and shoulders. I originally bought the Pro 3 and then upgraded after a few months to the more powerful Pro 5. The company only charged me the difference in price between the two for the upgrade, since I was within the initial return period for the Pro 3 (which I believe was either 60 or 90 days). I also found the company very accommodating by sending me (for free) the larger replacement tips when I had complained that the smaller tips I bought were too small for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I completely understand why so many people are unhappy with this product. After one year, I have DEFINITELY seen a thinning of the hair... perhaps only half-ish or so of the hair is growing back from use to use. However, I have had to use this product a LOT to get these results - about 2 times a week for a year, with each session lasting about 30 minutes. If you think that after a month or two that you will be hair-free, then you will probably be disappointed. Others have said that you get much faster results on &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hair, but as I guy, I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after each treatment your skin is smooth-ish, but not *perfectly* smooth. The advertising said it leaves you with no stubble, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair to say - I would say there is a &amp;#34;light stubble&amp;#34;. If you are a woman wanting silky smooth legs or underarms after each treatment, again, you may be disappointed. For me as a guy, I don&#x27;t have a need for &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; shoulders... just to get a thinning of the hair is nice. But, I do find that I have to pass over and over the same areas to remove the hair during each treatment... which is much more than the &amp;#34;three to four passes&amp;#34; recommended by the company. Sometimes the treatments can be really tedious... but I have seen enough positive results in thinning the hair over the months that it gives me the determination to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying this, just keep in mind that you will have to invest a LOT of time, and that the results may fall short of expectations. I recommend sticking to small areas that are more manageable and less time-consuming to treat. In the end, for the amount of time/money you have to invest, I think that most people will probably prefer to stick to shaving or waxing. For me, shaving irritates my shoulders, so the NoNo! was a reasonable alternative. Having said that, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend it to most people, because I just don&#x27;t think most would tolerate the slow, gradual results for the time/money outlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out that after several months, my Pro 5 unit died out on me (it was under warranty), and the company replaced it with no questions asked... and even did so before receiving my defective unit (which they paid to return to them). Also, contrary to others&#x27; experiences, I have found the replacement tips to last pretty long... about 4 to 6 weeks each, using it twice a week for a total of one hour per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I give the product four stars (three-and-a-half may be better), it&#x27;s because the NoNo! Pro 5 is a decent fit for me... but may not be a fit for most, depending on your needs and expectations. I hope this review gives an objective assessment of this seemingly controversial product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more effective at permanenty removing hair, as of now it just burns the top hair off and needs to be repeated when stubble reappears in a few days.  Maybe with long term use it will give me better results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It took a bit of time before all the hair disappeared, but it worked! I think it works just as well as going to the medical spas, plus I had to keep going back to them. With this I was able to use it on any area I wanted to and saved me a lot of money and time. I bought three more for my sisters for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Came with stuff missing and other things broken</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money ! !</li>
            <li> This literally doesn&#x27;t do crap. And it smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I have something way better anyway. It&#x27;s called a lighter and fine grit sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is the lighter and sandpaper only cost me $5!</li>
            <li> If there was a zero stars choice I would have done that. After the first use I called to return it. The rep said I had to keep it 45 days in order for them to pay for shipping. So I tried it another 3 times, by the book.&lt;br /&gt;NO!&lt;br /&gt;I will not wait 45 days.&lt;br /&gt;The idea was for me to use this while on vacation so I wouldn&#x27;t have stubble. Its claims to give &amp;#34;quick, silky, smooth, hair free results&amp;#34;. FALSE.</li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the manual but it&#x27;s really hard not to burn yourself, especially your face and underarms which were the main reason I got it.  I will keep using it though because waxing is more painful and I&#x27;m hoping eventually the hair will stop growing back.</li>
            <li> Not working!!  Followed directions to clean and now does not work.</li>
            <li> I received this item for christmas from my boyfriend. I break out when I shave and he thought it would help. When we recieved it, 2 of the 3 heads were broken and a half hour into using it the 3rd one broke. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Expecially with the price it is.</li>
            <li> This works just like the expensive professional electrolysis just not quite as powerful.  The only downside is the smell when in use but that quickly dissipates.  For anyone with that little extra &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; that you want removed this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like what they advertise...</li>
            <li> Had to return it. Did not work properly. Waiting for credit card refund and Amazon gift cery.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Then tried to return  it and it was non returnable. This is very upsetting</li>
            <li> easy to use, results are great</li>
            <li> No pain!!! Fast!! And easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome my girl never looked so smooth</li>
            <li> I guess it is Ok, Probably take time to really get experienced.</li>
            <li> Bought the NoNo for both my wife and I to use and sad to say but we are highly disappointed in this device. We both tried this device on different areas of our body that had fine to coarse hair and it utterly fails each and every time. All it does it burn the hair and buffing it does nothing to remove the hair afterwards. Followed the DVD and Youtube instructions and the results were vastly different with us. I even gave it another week of use with max power setting on my arm hair and all it did was singe my skin while leaving all the hair behind. I guess this device was meant for fine peach fuzz for even our fine hair was no match for this misleading product.</li>
            <li> Worthless product. Never even buy this product..</li>
