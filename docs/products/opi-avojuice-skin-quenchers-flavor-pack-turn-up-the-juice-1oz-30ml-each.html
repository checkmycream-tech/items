            <li> Small enough to fit in your coat pocket and really does work wonders on your chapped, dry winter hands with delightful fragrance. I order a pack every year and have a bottle or 2 to give away as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, before time! I think these are one of the best hand creams because they aren&#x27;t heavy and done leave residue but are very effective and smell AMAZING! Also love how they fit in my purse and there is a lot of variety.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s small enough to carry in your pocket which is what i do when I&#x27;m at work. Being a cashier my hands dry up terrible and this is great to have right in my pocket, I will be ordering more, it&#x27;s funny because I will put some on and my customers will say it smells good over here and I show them the bottle, it lasts awhile too</li>
            <li> A co-worker friend is addicted to these and she recommended them to me.  These smell sooooo good.  I plan on getting a larger portion to have, but the little flavor pack is great for your purse or travel.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. All the scents except one are so nice. I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful, but lotion is thin and scent fades fast.</li>

            <li> I LOVE OPI Avojuice. I hate the feeling for normal lotions. They always feel heavy and oily. As a nurse lotion is very important to me. I wash my hands often. This goes on smooth, smells great does not leave a residue. Fast shipping and product as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this set in order to decide what overall fragrance I liked best so I could order a large size.  I love them all and can&#x27;t decide which I like best.  So, I&#x27;ll keep buying this set and keep them in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing lotion ever. It feels like your hands just soaked up water. There is no greasy feel to it and you don&#x27;t have to use it fifteen times a day.</li>
            <li> thanks you... have one in purse now.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have a set of Avojoice for the winter, especially.  I prefer the little packets of 6 so I can enjoy the different fragrances.</li>
