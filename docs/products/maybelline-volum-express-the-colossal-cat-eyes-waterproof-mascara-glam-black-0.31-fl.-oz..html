            <li>This is one of the best mascara products I&#x27;ve run across in a while.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look great!  </li>
            <li>anyway this mascara is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>But after I get it applied, it looks great and the color is great.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions and use the tip of the applicator to add length and the side to thicken it works great.</li>
            <li>The color is great and it curls lashes and makes them appear longer</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS MASCARA!!</li>
            <li>It lengthens well and the curve of the brush is very nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I have good eyelashes</li>
            <li>This mascara is good for adding length to lashes, but does not provide any volume at all</li>
            <li>It shapes the lashes surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Makes eyelashes look great so easily!  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more when this runs out!</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes still looked amazing?</li>
            <li>But it does have a nice color and a brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a one-swipe and go kind of mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so, this gave a good look.</li>
            <li>the cat eye effect looked really nice</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews on it</li>
            <li>i honestly feel like Maybelline knows mascara.</li>
            <li>The formula was really nice</li>
            <li>The older styles of Maybelline are still the best.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found my favorite kind when I started using Volume Express Mega Plush however</li>
            <li>Not all that much better than others of its kind though</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>Love love love the brush.</li>
            <li>And I mostly look for length and something that doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>The curved brush allows me to better blend/&#x27;glue&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline mascaras</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re going for a more &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; &amp; just want to coat your eyelashes to look thicker</li>
            <li>Maybelline is my favorite brand for mascara.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>and I was in love with it for a week.</li>
            <li>, I soon realized I could not stand the spidery feeling of my eyelashes after wearing it for more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I love the curved applicator</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>i always use waterproof mascaras and i am SO GLAD this comes in waterproof.</li>
            <li>I got this more than 4 months ago</li>
            <li>Maybelline has been my favorite for 35 years.</li>
            <li>This mascara is just ok.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara because it was on allure magazines list for top 10 mascaras.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline mascaras</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there is more a mascara than how</li>
            <li>With buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well and looks really good.  </li>
            <li>The curved wand is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It makes it is easy to apply and I like the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Water proof and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>well as when the new product arrives, it&#x27;s a good reminder to now toss the one you were using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It grips my tiny, frail lashes and provides great color.</li>
            <li>Mascara has the shortest life span of all make up because the risk of transferring bacteria back and forth from your eye into the mascara tube is so great.</li>
            <li>It does give a great effect on the eyelashes, especially at the corners.</li>
            <li>My lashes are Ling but light in color</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy, consistent, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for clump free, easy application, and the cool curves for cat eyes like the product advertised.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this one and see what it did.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>and i was so excited.</li>
            <li>The company advertises that lashes will become 8x as full, however I have noticed that my lashes do not become nearly as full as they say.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this one is great because it can get the very tiny outer lashes to make your eyes really pop, and then you can just hold it longways to get the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 other ones before this and so far it is the best one.</li>
            <li>I started with the Colossal by Maybelline.</li>
            <li>the beginning of my senior year, I started using Colossal Cat Eye mascara by Maybelline.</li>
            <li>It is just watery it does curl your lashes and lengthens them good, but you have to apply it fast if you want to apply multiple coats.</li>
            <li>it was a colossal letdown.</li>
            <li>The tube is bright yellow andÂ easy to spot in my purse so for that reason I put it in there for a quick lash pick me up in short term situations, since it does transfer.</li>
            <li>It lifts my lashes right up</li>
            <li>Product came very fast and works as espected.</li>
            <li>This one not only makes my lashes look longer, it doesn&#x27;t flake or clump like most of them</li>
            <li>if i just brushed it more to the side.</li>
            <li>so be aware if you are going to use it do not expect it to thicken your lashes at all.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes your eyelashes more noticeable.</li>
            <li>There are better mascaras at the Dollar Store (if only I could verify animal testing).  </li>
            <li>my Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Pumped Up Colossal Waterproof Mascara.</li>
            <li>Also if I forget to wash it off before bed I am likely to wake up with raccoon eyes that do not wash off easily.</li>
            <li>three months should be the absolute maximum length of time that anyone uses a tube of mascara.</li>
            <li>so this was a real shock to me.</li>
            <li>My one eye looks really</li>
            <li>and i really just wish i saw a review like this.</li>
            <li>the real wand works.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I got none of this, it was SO VERY CLUMPY</li>
            <li>but if anyone who does sees this I would like a lifetime supply thanks</li>
            <li>This one is very waterproof and doesn&#x27;t apply in clumps whatsoever.</li>
            <li>but it has a very chemically smell</li>
            <li>Really defines each and every lash.</li>
            <li>so it really brings out the length of them</li>
            <li>i have used many different brands over the years and alot of the different types from Maybelline.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this won&#x27;t happen with the Colossal Cat Eye because I don&#x27;t know what mascara I would use next.</li>
            <li>I have used mascara since I was fourteen years old as a freshman in high school.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that all the old mascara should be removed before adding new mascara to avoid clumping and the lashes bunching together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly i found i could get the same look by using my normal (hard candy) mascara</li>
            <li>The wand shape does the job of reaching my corner lashes perfectly, especially because I don&#x27;t have much lash to start.</li>
            <li>No clumps and lashes looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have to use waterproof mascara and have found vast differences between the different manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I then started changing back and forth between different brands and how much and how often I would apply it.</li>
            <li>A little more messy than I prefer.</li>
            <li>The curved brush allows for mostly even coverage and each coat I apply allows for control over how dark and thick I desire my lashes to be.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara because you don&#x27;t get too much or too little mascara on the brush.</li>

            <li> The curved brush allows for mostly even coverage and each coat I apply allows for control over how dark and thick I desire my lashes to be.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because you don&#x27;t get too much or too little mascara on the brush.</li>
            <li> problems I have noticed include: if I don&#x27;t wait for the first coat to dry before adding more coats, then it will become clumpy at the base.</li>
            <li> it is barely have any liquid inside, all dry out!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is curved too much and is hard to get mascara close to the lash line w/o out smudging it on the lid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my lashes become almost twice as long as they are when I have no makeup on.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for as long as I can, however I have heard that after a while mascara will no longer work because the body becomes accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> They make my eyelashes long and define.  </li>
            <li> Long long lashes.</li>
            <li> The curved brush was not pretty and yellow like the packet showed at it looked average just like all the other brushes, nothing new here.</li>
            <li> Make your eyelashes look very long</li>
            <li> If your mascara starts to dry out before its 90 days is up, throw it away.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t let it dry between coats, as the packet instructed so</li>
            <li> Dry brush with an eyelash brush to remove excess and to separate your lashes.</li>
            <li> It did not create volume or feline lashes, this is just a poor quality mascara in a pretty packet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have noticed that other Maybelline mascaras have this problem as well</li>
            <li> Length is average, though.</li>
            <li> Next time I wont do the waterproof though because that stuff sticks, very hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> I find a few coats does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it is thick texture and black color, but goopy and stinky</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to wash off because water proof.</li>
            <li> This gooped up in my eyelashes and smelled icky.</li>
            <li> Taking a wet Q-tip and rubbing the tip back and forth at the base of the lashes can fix this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this mascara has a curved brush, which is a little difficult for me to apply.  </li>
            <li> It also clumps really bad if you touch them anytime after applying it, such as if you rub your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my first terrible experience with makeup</li>
            <li> but the brush is not nice at all!</li>
            <li> have not experienced any irritation to my eyes, eyelids, or skin thereof from usage of this product.</li>
            <li> and if it is mildly irritating</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I was wearing it at all.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s Maybelline, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> like a crazy amount.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> It even smells bad.  </li>
            <li> And it would hurt and rip at my lashes :(</li>
            <li> Hours after it is still tacky, which is annoying in itself, but really annoying when it smudges.</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It might be waterproof, but it smudges awful.</li>

            <li> Love love love the brush. It grips my tiny, frail lashes and provides great color. Length is average, though. And I mostly look for length and something that doesn&#x27;t run. This one is a runner. About an hour after application it smeared to my under eye area. Not good! I did get waterproof, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t run and would hold a curl. Nope! But it does have a nice color and a brush I can work with. The tube is bright yellow andÂ easy to spot in my purse so for that reason I put it in there for a quick lash pick me up in short term situations, since it does transfer. Would not repurchase again, but will save the brush when it is finished to hopefully pair with a mascara formula that doesn&#x27;t run. 3.5/5</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascara products I&#x27;ve run across in a while. I have very oily skin and have to use waterproof mascara and have found vast differences between the different manufacturers. This one not only makes my lashes look longer, it doesn&#x27;t flake or clump like most of them and it&#x27;s easy to remove with makeup remover. Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy, consistent, and goes on easily. I find a few coats does the trick. The curved brush allows for mostly even coverage and each coat I apply allows for control over how dark and thick I desire my lashes to be. I especially like using this when after I&#x27;ve applied strip lashes. The curved brush allows me to better blend/&#x27;glue&#x27; my natural lashes into the artificial ones for better believability.&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any irritation to my eyes, eyelids, or skin thereof from usage of this product. However, if I&#x27;m a klutz and accidentally touch the tip of the wand to my eye during application....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a cotton pad saturated with non-oily makeup remover and gently swiped across my lashes a few times to remove this product.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the waterproof, which did hold up at a ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe and Save works well as when the new product arrives, it&#x27;s a good reminder to now toss the one you were using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brightestbulbinthebox&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;...three months should be the absolute maximum length of time that anyone uses a tube of mascara. You should also go ahead and toss any products that change in consistency, smell, texture, or appearance, since this can be a sign that they are way over the hill...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dummies.com/how-to/content/how-long-should-you-keep-your-make-up.html&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;...Toss your mascara after 3 months. Mascara has the shortest life span of all make up because the risk of transferring bacteria back and forth from your eye into the mascara tube is so great. If your mascara starts to dry out before its 90 days is up, throw it away. Donât add water or saliva to your mascara to rewet it. Doing so will only increase your chances of getting an eye infection....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;popsugar.com.au/beauty/How-Long-Can-You-Keep-Makeup-Lipstick-Foundation-Mascara-32109079&lt;br /&gt;  Three months</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline mascaras so I was excited to try this one and see what it did.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I was wearing it at all.  It does not provide any volume to the lashes whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t understand why it has a smell either.  Definitely not going to buy it again!  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to provide volume....it doesn&#x27;t! I was so excited to get this and I am very disappointed. What a waist of money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara but it&#x27;s just lackluster. If you&#x27;re going for the butterfly eyelash look then this mascara isn&#x27;t for you. After 2+ coats it starts clumping....as people on YouTube have said it did. BUT. if you&#x27;re going for a more &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; &amp; just want to coat your eyelashes to look thicker then this works. As it&#x27;s waterproof...IT STICKS. I personally had 0 fallout. But i&#x27;ll be going back to my Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Pumped Up Colossal Waterproof Mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look great!  Maybelline is my favorite brand for mascara.  Next time I wont do the waterproof though because that stuff sticks, very hard to get off.  I use makeup remover and wash my face and I still have it some lingering.</li>
            <li> This gooped up in my eyelashes and smelled icky. Maybe I got a bad batch but I&#x27;m not going to try again.</li>
            <li> I wear my mascara in this &amp;#34;cat style&amp;#34; anyway, so thought I&#x27;d try out this.  I always use waterproof too.  The brush is dryish.  So there&#x27;s not a lot of clumping on your lashes.  You&#x27;ll likely have to redip it to apply it the way the commercials make it look.  It&#x27;s not a one-swipe and go kind of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not overly caking.  That&#x27;s good.  The mascara seems to stay moist on the lashes for a while.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s NOT smudge proof.  If you rub your eyes, the stuff is going to get on you.  it does on my fingers.  But it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> It might be waterproof, but it smudges awful. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I swear by this mascara. I stopped experimenting with different kinds when I found this one. My routine is to curl my lashes and then apply this in a wispy manner while applying pressure. It lifts my lashes right up and they stay that way ALL day. Would you believe that I went swimming with this on and my eyelashes still looked amazing? I&#x27;ve kept repurchasing it over the years!</li>
            <li> Okay so, this gave a good look. the cat eye effect looked really nice and I was in love with it for a week. Then I noticed my eyelashes falling out... like a crazy amount.  Every time i would wipe it off with makeup remover i would have about 4 eyelashes come off too. I have good eyelashes so this was a real shock to me. My one eye looks really bad(luckily its my bangs side so i can cover it up..but still). Also, while it was applied my eyelashes would snag on everything (hair, shirt, blanket) EVERYTHING. And it would hurt and rip at my lashes :( I read so many good reviews on it and i was so excited. But now i just wish i wouldn&#x27;t have done it. It might take a while for my lashes to grow back. Honestly i found i could get the same look by using my normal (hard candy) mascara if i just brushed it more to the side. This is my first terrible experience with makeup and i really just wish i saw a review like this. SO IF YOU ARE READING THIS DONT DO IT! SAVE YOURSELF! FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT DOESNT DAMAGE YOUR EYELASHES.</li>
            <li> it is barely have any liquid inside, all dry out!!!</li>
            <li> Makes eyelashes look great so easily!  I will be buying more when this runs out!</li>
            <li> I have used mascara since I was fourteen years old as a freshman in high school. I started with the Colossal by Maybelline. When I started, I used an eyelash curler before I applied the mascara. I then started changing back and forth between different brands and how much and how often I would apply it. I thought I had found my favorite kind when I started using Volume Express Mega Plush however, I soon realized I could not stand the spidery feeling of my eyelashes after wearing it for more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning of my senior year, I started using Colossal Cat Eye mascara by Maybelline. I was still using my eyelash curler, but soon stopped when I realized I no longer needed it because of how well the real wand works.&lt;br /&gt;Some problems I have noticed include: if I don&#x27;t wait for the first coat to dry before adding more coats, then it will become clumpy at the base. Taking a wet Q-tip and rubbing the tip back and forth at the base of the lashes can fix this. I have also noticed that all the old mascara should be removed before adding new mascara to avoid clumping and the lashes bunching together.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my lashes become almost twice as long as they are when I have no makeup on. The company advertises that lashes will become 8x as full, however I have noticed that my lashes do not become nearly as full as they say.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought the same mascara for almost a year now and have gone through nearly ten tubes. I will continue using this product for as long as I can, however I have heard that after a while mascara will no longer work because the body becomes accustomed to it. Hopefully this won&#x27;t happen with the Colossal Cat Eye because I don&#x27;t know what mascara I would use next.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good for adding length to lashes, but does not provide any volume at all so be aware if you are going to use it do not expect it to thicken your lashes at all.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite mascaras! They make my eyelashes long and define.  I love the curved applicator</li>
            <li> Product came very fast and works as espected. Kinda hard to wash off because water proof.</li>
            <li> It is just watery it does curl your lashes and lengthens them good, but you have to apply it fast if you want to apply multiple coats. it&#x27;s okay but I would prefer to use a different mascara for length and volume.</li>
            <li> Not all that much better than others of its kind though</li>
            <li> After seeing the hype this mascara was getting on T.V I decided to try it out. I was looking for clump free, easy application, and the cool curves for cat eyes like the product advertised. I got none of this, it was SO VERY CLUMPY I was picking clumps off my eyelashes, I didn&#x27;t let it dry between coats, as the packet instructed so I know it was not how I was putting it on. The curved brush was not pretty and yellow like the packet showed at it looked average just like all the other brushes, nothing new here. It did not create volume or feline lashes, this is just a poor quality mascara in a pretty packet.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recomend this mascara to anyone it was a colossal letdown.</li>
            <li> It works great. A little more messy than I prefer. It definitely makes your eyelashes more noticeable. And the waterproof is official</li>
            <li> i didnt even buy this mascara from Amazon yet. it does seem cheaper on here than in the stores though so i will prob start buying from amazon. anyway this mascara is AWESOME. i have used many different brands over the years and alot of the different types from Maybelline. i honestly feel like Maybelline knows mascara. I always go back to them. this one is great because it can get the very tiny outer lashes to make your eyes really pop, and then you can just hold it longways to get the bottom lashes. i always use waterproof mascaras and i am SO GLAD this comes in waterproof. I LOVE THIS MASCARA!! i dont work for Maybelline but if anyone who does sees this I would like a lifetime supply thanks</li>
            <li> Make your eyelashes look very long</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this mascara has a curved brush, which is a little difficult for me to apply.  But after I get it applied, it looks great and the color is great.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because you don&#x27;t get too much or too little mascara on the brush. It shapes the lashes surprisingly well. I got this more than 4 months ago and I still have some left. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Maybelline has been my favorite for 35 years. Someone said it doesn&#x27;t lengthen the lashes.  If you follow the directions and use the tip of the applicator to add length and the side to thicken it works great. Dry brush with an eyelash brush to remove excess and to separate your lashes. The older styles of Maybelline are still the best.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just ok. The brush is curved too much and is hard to get mascara close to the lash line w/o out smudging it on the lid. After a couple of hours my lashes look stuck together and I only use two coats. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara because it was on allure magazines list for top 10 mascaras.  I am very satisfied with it.  I like the curved brush, makes it easier to put on.  No clumps or thickness.  It goes on very well and looks really good.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s Maybelline, I&#x27;m not impressed. There are better mascaras at the Dollar Store (if only I could verify animal testing).  It even smells bad.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it is thick texture and black color, but goopy and stinky are not my thing. FYI ~ It doesn&#x27;t smell once it dries.</li>
            <li> The wand shape does the job of reaching my corner lashes perfectly, especially because I don&#x27;t have much lash to start. This one is very waterproof and doesn&#x27;t apply in clumps whatsoever. I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 other ones before this and so far it is the best one.</li>
            <li> I like the curved brush. It makes it is easy to apply and I like the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. The curved wand is super easy to use! Long long lashes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever tried!  I&#x27;ve tried expensive brands but have never been this satisfied.  It has never been clumpy and does not flake.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> No clumps and lashes looks natural.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline mascaras but this one was just unacceptable! The formula was really nice but the brush is not nice at all!</li>
            <li> The color is great and it curls lashes and makes them appear longer but it has a very chemically smell and if it is mildly irritating</li>
            <li> Water proof and easy to apply.  Only a Q-tip with lotion to wipe smudges needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim as it was only $5 at Walmart. It does give a great effect on the eyelashes, especially at the corners. It lengthens well and the curve of the brush is very nice. Based solely on that I would give it 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is more a mascara than how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula must be oil based. Hours after it is still tacky, which is annoying in itself, but really annoying when it smudges. It also clumps really bad if you touch them anytime after applying it, such as if you rub your eyes. Also if I forget to wash it off before bed I am likely to wake up with raccoon eyes that do not wash off easily. I have noticed that other Maybelline mascaras have this problem as well</li>
            <li> Really defines each and every lash. With buy more when needed. My lashes are Ling but light in color so it really brings out the length of them</li>
