            <li>It holds a charge for quite some time, too, making it perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Superb!</li>
            <li>Who knows what wonders will occur when you look impeccable!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good body groomer to shave off unwanted hair, this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li>And while he looks great, using the Wahl beard trimmer on his chest leaves the ends of his chest hair blunt and prickly.</li>
            <li>the results are really great.</li>
            <li>the results are really great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product and gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product.issues where the battery continuously discharges even when not in use.  </li>
            <li>It is great if you are prone to ingrown hairs with blade shaving, but of course it does not provide the silky skin feel that razor shaving does.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I still had to finish up with a razor, but it gave me a great start.  </li>
            <li>Great body grooming machine.  </li>
            <li>Works great for trimming those, not so sightly, areas.  </li>
            <li>Worked great after 1st use.  </li>
            <li>i like it and it is very easy and the extended arm is awesome.</li>
            <li>Also worked very nice on neck hair.  </li>
            <li>Very nice gadget.</li>
            <li>Very good product with a nicely finished look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great price point - not that good at dealing with body hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>Although this may be perceived as designed for men, I am thrilled with this shaver!</li>
            <li>I don’t know if this is a good idea or not</li>
            <li>Still, it might be a good idea to start on chest, arms or legs before trying to use it elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a feels really good in my hand and will allow for use of up to 50 minutes or so on a charge.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>He experimented with the different trimmer attachments and found medium the best for his chest and got great results!</li>
            <li>For the most part that combination has worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this groomer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He moved on to the body parts that the Bodygroomer is designed for and using it was easy, and he got great results.</li>
            <li>The Bodygroomer works great and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great brand and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>He did have to pass the Bodygroomer over some body parts more than once to get even good results.</li>
            <li>also tried the Bodygroomer, and it glides nicely over areas I trimmed.</li>
            <li>And with warm weather arriving, might as well keep everything look neat and</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the head flexed a bit to make getting into nooks and crannies easier&lt;</li>
            <li>Sleek &amp; Trendy.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>worked nicely for us.  </li>
            <li>Fully waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is balanced and so it feels nice in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure there is some attraction to being a haggard caveman, but there is more to being impeccably groomed and that starts with your BODY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>good:&lt;br /&gt;- WONDERFUL back extension that is super sturdy and the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br</li>
            <li>This groomer makes it very easy to handle that issue by myself.</li>
            <li>He thought the reach on the extension was perfect and was amazed at how far he could reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems useful, but I don&#x27;t use it so it just takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool that helps me get the positive impression I want from the lady in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>Now that he&#x27;s figured out which trimmer attachment is best for him, next time will be a breeze.</li>
            <li>Glad to say, he didn&#x27;t get one nick or cut.</li>
            <li>I think this Philips Bodygroomer 3100 is simply fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think this Philips Bodygroomer 3100 is simply fantastic!</li>
            <li>That went okay.</li>
            <li>Best is that when they do need replacing the price is quite low and the interchange is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a nice fit.  </li>
            <li>Most people probably order this to shave their backs as it shows in the photo and describes in the description but that is not why I decided  to try out the shaver.</li>
            <li>We love the Bodygroomer for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>love how well the razor fits in your hand.</li>
            <li>He liked how secure the razor fits in the extension holder.</li>
            <li>The clips can be put on in either top or bottom orientation depending on how you prefer to hold the razor and depending on what area of your body you&#x27;re</li>
            <li>With the attachable combs it is simple to get the perfect trim of beards everytime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple months to use this groomer now and think it is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident now as a runner who jogs 25 miles per week with no shirt on.  </li>
            <li>and I can see much better.</li>
            <li>love it and would recommend it to any woman looking for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I think my wife loves this groomer more than I do, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Is very powerful!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, safe and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, safe and</li>
            <li>This is also great for young teens with body hair issues as it&#x27;s really safe to use too.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean between uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They say it&#x27;s good to be pure of body, mind and spirit.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a convenient charging cradle and (more importantly)</li>
            <li>consider this trimmer an indispensable tool now, and easily recommend it as a fantastic solution to self-shave body hair!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been doing his own manscaping without the right tools.</li>
            <li>found the extension handle made for an easy reach, but also made the trimmer clumsier to use.</li>
            <li>It is truly easy to use and grab.</li>
            <li>It is easily used as a hand tool but also comes with a sturdy attachment to get those spots your arms are not made to reach.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver it to get to all the areas I want</li>
            <li>works fine but doesnt cut so neatly,, it leaves some pits here and there..</li>
            <li>Presumably this is best used for grooming sensitive areas - especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at thinning the forest - but I have gotten good results without using the guide.  </li>
            <li>He actually thought it  worked quite well trimming his beard, but didn&#x27;t work great for shaving his face.</li>
            <li>but my man lightly sprayed WD40 on the head after rinsing – but then he puts WD40 on everything that has mechanical parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The parts and attachments feel cheap and breakable (made in China).</li>
            <li>It gets the job done leaving the area closely shaved and smooth with no fear of a \\&quot;gotcha!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the overall results, and for the sensitive areas, it is the best product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I can tell how smooth it is just from your hand wiping it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The groomer snaps into the folding extension and stays securely in it.</li>
            <li>plastic combs are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I opened the shaver, I thought &#x27;Great, another clamshell package that I&#x27;m going to have to struggle with to get open.</li>
            <li>45 day risk-free trial&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great, portable shaver that&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
            <li>This is one fantastic groomer.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I really was quite pleased with this as I was able to shave my legs quickly and the best part -- no nicks or missed areas from the usual razor technique I&#x27;ve been using in the shower for many years.</li>
            <li>The extender is very handy when trying to reach your shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Clean, smooth shave feeling when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li>If you want a quick, easy, efficient way to control body hair, this works.</li>
            <li>To optimize battery life, instructions state that after the first charge it&#x27;s best to continue to use the groomer until the battery is completely empty before recharging &amp; DO NOT keep it permanently plugged in.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco recognizes this and the unique needs for shaving beyond the face with their Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more fond of their other body groomers which were more effective with men&#x27;s hair in the shower</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t grow a lot of hair but likes it clean.</li>
            <li>but you must clean the head every minute</li>
            <li>They are great if you use them every single day.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars due to the fact that some areas of the face/neck will require a finishing touch up with a real razor for the perfect clean look.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer should be great; it&#x27;s cordless, can be operated in wet conditions, and has a handle to help get to those out of reach</li>
            <li>is more suitable to following peaks and valleys.  </li>
            <li>His chest hair is nice and even, and it feels soft to the touch rather than blunt or prickly.  </li>
            <li>The unit cleans up well under running water or shaken in a sink full or tepid water.</li>
            <li>This is a lot of territory, and the Bodygroomer is ready for most of it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s waterproof which is really cool.  </li>
            <li>life;both will go for over an hour on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Cut and irritation level.  </li>
            <li>The Phillips Norcelco is a good body trainer for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>and I would love recommend it to anyone who wants to groom their body hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Full 2-year Warranty</li>
            <li>I find it more effective to just hold the main unit and reach as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charged quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I was mourning the fact that it hasn&#x27;t healed as quickly as it shroud, with the weather turning warmer and the sun shining brighter</li>
            <li>This particular shaver is more towards the precision end of things.  </li>
            <li>main unit itself is a slightly better grade of plastic, but does not provide any confidence in durability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected better honestly</li>
            <li>I also tested the MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Body Groomer and Trimmer which I found was much better at dealing with thicker hair and whose trimmer guides gave a much more even trim.</li>
            <li>excellent at reaching the middle back.  </li>
            <li>It has done a great job so far, is easy to clean, powerful enough, and versatile.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>The size of the shaver head was comfortable for maneuvering in that area and it worked out very well!</li>
            <li>Essentially identical to the very competent BG2028, the BG2034 adds an (optional) folding extension handle.</li>
            <li>Real easy to use especially on my back.  </li>
            <li>but overall I was very satisfied with the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The underarms area is pretty straightforward</li>
            <li>He felt it fit and and could be taken out with complete easy.</li>
            <li>Great for leaving a little bit of length on underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the 7100 may be worth the investment for people with the thickest body hair (it&#x27;s description suggests that) or it may go longer without needing to replace heads because it&#x27;s 2 sided, but in our house the lower priced 3100 model with the extender meets all of our needs.</li>
            <li>I think the 7100 may be worth the investment for people with the thickest body hair (it&#x27;s description suggests that) or it may go longer without needing to replace heads because it&#x27;s 2 sided, but in our house the lower priced 3100 model with the extender meets all of our needs.</li>
            <li>Better luck next time.ought cheaply.   </li>
            <li>worth noting that 50 minutes per charge is ample time to do the work I need to do.</li>
            <li>This product comes with an extension wand that you clip the razor into that will allow you to reach your back, and if you are brave and talented enough, the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Bodygroom 3100 delivers on its promise to give you a close and save shave in our most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It seems useful, but I don&#x27;t use it so it just takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The key to a nice shave, particularly in that sensitive area, seems to be keeping your skin pulled nice and taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is basically an update of the previous, hugely successful Philips Bodygroomer.  </li>
            <li>In other words, you save time and storage space since all you need to do is flip it upside-down, but it is longer than BG2034 and doesn&#x27;t fit quite as nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li>First a quick comment about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The battery is long lasting, it fits perfectly on our bathroom sink, is waterproof so it can go into the shower with you, and it shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>The price seems right for what you get.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>the clamshell opened right up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have a habit of not shaving on weekends and by Monday morning I have too much hair for the electric razor to shave cleanly.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver/groomer that you can take in the shower with you!  </li>
            <li>It seems pretty powerful and being cordless, which is a must, is helpful.</li>
            <li>Like the 3100, the 7100 operates so simply that he can select the length he wants and just pass the Bodygroomer over his own legs without help from mom or any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>The 7100 has a more solid feel and the dual heads, but the differences may not be worth the premium price for a lot people.</li>
            <li>The 7100 has a more solid feel and the dual heads, but the differences may not be worth the premium price for a lot people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas - though you should still be careful -</li>
            <li>The 8100 is also much narrower, so it allows you to get into crevices and follow contours beyond the 3100&#x27;s reach, but requires more passes to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;-Long reach tool.  </li>
            <li>The handle is large enough that if you had someone with difficulty grasping the slender handles on a traditional razor this product might be a great gift for them as well.</li>
            <li>so the first thing he did was use it for trimming his beard and shaving his face despite the fact it&#x27;s not made for the face.</li>
            <li>I feel an elderly person would not be able to get this open</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty hairy dude.</li>
            <li>many years I&#x27;ve simply used my trusty Wahl clippers, some accessories, and trimming scissors to get the job done.</li>
            <li>First area I tried this on was my armpits.</li>
            <li>and we have the first problem.</li>
            <li>Better luck next time.</li>
            <li>She has told me more than once, &amp;#34;You need to do something about that hair&amp;#34; and she was referring to a patch of hair on my back.</li>
            <li>The Bodygroomer by Philips Norelco is the first body shaver that convinced me to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have shaved him which he commented on when I gave the first swipe after I did one side.</li>
            <li>The first tweak extends the life of the product through an improved power button.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to tackle my underarms and groin area.</li>
            <li>I note that this can also be used in the shower, but I will probably use it outside of there as I like to be able to sit to shave</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It was fast and efficient, much faster than the previous best shaver I had for the same job.</li>
            <li>It works much much better than my previous &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; trimmer - which came for free with a set of buzz</li>
            <li>no irritation at all at least for me(kinda have sensitive skin) and the most good thing about that it give you smooth finish from the first trial no need to repeat on the same area.....</li>
            <li>It is powerful and I&#x27;m left with smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good enough for 10-15 sessions depending on how extensive they are.  </li>
            <li>Bodygroomer was pretty much over.</li>
            <li>have both, but if I had to choose, the 8100 is still my favorite as I do not need to fiddle with blade guards and the narrower head on the long hair trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer itself is really geared toward body hair and works pretty darn</li>
            <li>BG2034 is smaller, contoured to fit better in your hand, but you will need to switch plastic combs for different tasks.  </li>
            <li>how much you are willing to spend.</li>
            <li>extended handle, back shaving attachment, is not only great for reaching your back and shoulders, it&#x27;s also useful for anyone who has problems bending to shave their legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it easily shaved off the stray patches and tufts of hair he gets on his shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>it comes with makes it easy for one person to shave their back.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and cuts very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Power button is large and easily pressed while shaving (not an issue if you&#x27;re using the back extension)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It really makes shaving the back hair easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>he wants to groom.</li>
            <li>He also trimmed his legs and arms and that went fast</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bodygroomer is really for my wife.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally the shaver will pull at hairs and may take a couple passes to get a completely smooth feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on you bathroom vanity or medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>My husband is a weight lifter and likes a smooth chest and back.</li>
            <li>Not working very well</li>
            <li>the folding extension wand has 7 locking (angled to straight) positions.</li>
            <li>These should be better even if it required a small increase in cost, it would be worth it to have higher quality combs</li>
            <li>Cuts real close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Where the Bodygroomer really struggles is with thicker hair and below the waist &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The Norelco Bodygroom 3100 promises a safe and gentle trim for any area below the neck and offers flexibility with its three different comb attachments and an extension attachment to help you reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model uses a hard button on top of a rubber gasket, which has much better action and eliminates the faulty button design of the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can be used dry or wet, but dry skin and hair work best for us because water creates some resistance.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that these blades are self sharpening and is designed to reach areas that normally are not accessible by one person.  </li>
            <li>But if I use this groomer first, it cuts that facial hair shorter, not good enough for a shave, but it leaves it at a perfect length for my facial electric razor to finish the job for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>is ok, and did not fail while trying it, but because it just clocked in, I am just not comfortable using it often.</li>
            <li>tried on myself and it is very fast and efficient concerning complete hair removal....</li>
            <li>but it seemed to work better when the hair was dry which surprised both of us.</li>
            <li>I will compare this groomer to what was my previous favorite, the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased, but there is definitely room for improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>may be wrong on this, but I believe the old battery was a NiCd, which is not an ideal battery technology.  </li>
            <li>The 8100 does not require you to change blade guards and limits the wear on the main blade, unlike the 3100.  </li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t need to use the extension for the back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fine for privates if you&#x27;re careful, even though the manual says not to.  </li>
            <li>: Comfortable trimming, multiple choices on cutting length, cordless, lightweight, easy to clean and -- here&#x27;s a big one -- the extension handle that enables you to trim your own back hair.</li>
            <li>In most cases, the long hair cutter works well to the transition to short hair</li>
            <li>I may not be able to bend down as far as I used to but the extender allows me to shave my legs without a lot of discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much destined to live my middling years keeping back my tuft of chest hair from linking up south of the Equator with the hairy rebels...</li>
            <li>This gadget is quite handy and is definitely easier to use to groom/remove body hair than just trying to use a typical electric shaver.</li>
            <li>but if you suddenly decide to shave your arms, legs, and torso, it&#x27;s probably not the right tool for the job.  </li>
            <li>Folks who are a larger size, or have very tight shoulders may find the extension handle more useful than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but he does like to be able to tame the cave man</li>
            <li>Being a fan of using purpose-oriented devices I periodically wander over and try out new products.</li>
            <li>Like the new attachment.</li>
            <li>is that when my husband tried it on his face he didn&#x27;t think it left him as smooth as his traditional razor.</li>
            <li>The limitation - of course - is that some of those areas are very sensitive, and some of them may require the hair-cutting equivalent of a riding lawnmower.  </li>
            <li>This allows men or women to use it on various parts of their bodies to get exactly the shave desired.</li>
            <li>I love the close shave on dry, clean legs, and it took only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The update tweaks a number of design elements for the better, and now includes an extension arm for hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means I&#x27;d have to stop fairly frequently and unclog the trimmer</li>
            <li>Works very well for shaving sideburns and back hair.  </li>
            <li>, the silver is the old 2028).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from the handle, the unit is similar to the BG2028 in battery life and performance, and works very well.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re reasonably flexible, and/or have a medium build or smaller, chances are you don&#x27;t need the extension handle and can go with the cheaper BG2028.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the manual still recommends discharging the product completely before charging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my skin taut as far as I can.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s recommended to completely discharge the battery twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fail to mention that he was loving the results so much, he shaved his man parts.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done but kind of regret buying it when a gap of the trimmer was broken explained a lot why it wasn&#x27;t working well on my arm.</li>
            <li>thin hair, like you&#x27;d find on your back or chest, the Bodygroomer does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>Like the older model, the included cutter doesn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as the replacement (&amp;#34;refill&amp;#34;) cutters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took me 10 minutes to do the whole thing including the chest and stomach plus an additional 2 to vacuum the area for any strays.</li>
            <li>It works mainly by the two &amp;#34;external&amp;#34; rows of cutters, so you need to position the shaver in such a way that those cutters are close to your skin.</li>
            <li>It does a excellent job at accomplishing what I was unable to do with other methods -- transforming my unsightly simian look into a human with just a bit of masculine hair in the proper places.</li>
            <li>Both leave a close and smooth cut with very little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge during a use which can easily exceed 10-15 minutes of constant heavy use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the knack of using the Bodygroomer because it&#x27;s ergonomically shaped and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It did not have the small pieces that require precise</li>
            <li>It took a full 8 hours to charge upon arrival (as advertised in the instructions), and then you&#x27;re supposed to use it until the battery is dead and charge again (presumably another 8 hours).</li>
            <li>We shave, we cut, we epilate, we wax, we trim, we tweeze, we pluck and now we take it a step further and go for the whole all over bodygroom, especially my husband.</li>
            <li>Or alternately, hold it from the very end for maximum reach, which is only usable &amp;#34;over the shoulder&amp;#34;, because of the curve of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This  trimmer just bogs down in my chest hair and started  pulling hairs almost right away.</li>
            <li>It usually takes me about 25-30 minutes to put on the cream, shave, repeatedly rinse wipe and clean off before putting on some cream for so</li>
            <li>The next problem is that the head gets clogged frequently and the trimmer just doesn&#x27;t have the power to push through.</li>
            <li>When the guys use this on their underarms it keeps things neat without looking bare.</li>
            <li>With or without the comb attachments, you must go over the area repeatedly to get a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic combs, holder and especially the back attachment are light precariously thin leaving</li>
            <li>It come also with 3 comb attachments so you can pick your poison of hair length from bare to visibly coiffed.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive areas might require extra care on the operator&#x27;s part and a bit of an acclimatization period, but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the biggest con I can say about it is that the sheering process irritates my sensitive skin a bit, but the red patches fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Both work very well on your body hair with minimal nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Again, don&#x27;t expect a razor close shave, but you will remove tons of hair from hard to reach areas or large areas which will be free of razor burn and cuts, scratches or other irritation marks.</li>
            <li>I believe the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer can help with the first; the other two are up to you!</li>
            <li>big difference is the new (optional) extension handle, meant for trimming one&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>But they typically have longer lives and higher energy densities than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they typically have longer lives and higher energy densities than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cordless shaver and comes with a charger, an extender to reach your hairy back or butt, three comb attachments (that trim to 1/8&amp;#34;, 3/16&amp;#34; or 9/32&amp;#34;) to trim leg, underarm, chest, arm or other hair to varying hair lengths and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>that said, Philips Norelco has put together a decent trimmer package if you&#x27;re the type of guy with the proper (thin) hair or just need light trimming duty.</li>
            <li>This presents the problem of being in an area that is hard to reach or being dependent on a friendly mate to do the job for you.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it has the typical trimmer blade sections and also the screen covered shaver section which nearly eliminates the left over razor stubble.</li>
            <li>My son in his early teens hasn&#x27;t tried the 3100, but he has the more expensive Philips Bodygroomer 7100</li>
            <li>/&gt;In case you&#x27;re looking at both, the 7100 is heavier, shinier and has a lot of stainless steel, it has the shaver on one end and a separate trimmer on the other, it has a pivoting head and the trimmer is adjustable to 5 different lengths (not just 3).</li>
            <li>The Philips Bodygroomer attachments enable me to be precise with the length of hair left behind, and it always looks even and natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to shave down to smooth skin, but I also don&#x27;t like the prickly feeling I got from the short hairs left by using other methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We found that the hair was removed quickly and easily with no pulling or painful scraping.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it!and has a lot of stainless steel, it has the shaver on one end and a separate trimmer on the other, it has a pivoting head and the trimmer is adjustable to 5 different lengths (not just 3).</li>
            <li>Slick case, but adding a rubberized grip would be useful especially since it&#x27;s going to be used in the shower&lt;</li>
            <li>It cuts well without injury to sensitive areas, and its near omni-directional head provides versatility for some tight body spaces.  </li>
            <li>That is good and bad, as it&#x27;s easier to use this way, but it means storing another item.</li>

            <li> you are looking for a good body groomer to shave off unwanted hair, this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> And while he looks great, using the Wahl beard trimmer on his chest leaves the ends of his chest hair blunt and prickly.</li>
            <li> the results are really great.</li>
            <li> the results are really great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product and gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product.issues where the battery continuously discharges even when not in use.  </li>
            <li> It is great if you are prone to ingrown hairs with blade shaving, but of course it does not provide the silky skin feel that razor shaving does.</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> I still had to finish up with a razor, but it gave me a great start.  </li>

            <li> Very good product with a nicely finished look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great price point - not that good at dealing with body hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Although this may be perceived as designed for men, I am thrilled with this shaver!</li>
            <li> I don’t know if this is a good idea or not</li>
            <li> Still, it might be a good idea to start on chest, arms or legs before trying to use it elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a feels really good in my hand and will allow for use of up to 50 minutes or so on a charge.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> He experimented with the different trimmer attachments and found medium the best for his chest and got great results!</li>
            <li> For the most part that combination has worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this groomer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He moved on to the body parts that the Bodygroomer is designed for and using it was easy, and he got great results.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroomer works great and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great brand and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> He did have to pass the Bodygroomer over some body parts more than once to get even good results.</li>
            <li> also tried the Bodygroomer, and it glides nicely over areas I trimmed.</li>
            <li> And with warm weather arriving, might as well keep everything look neat and</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the head flexed a bit to make getting into nooks and crannies easier&lt;</li>
            <li> Sleek &amp; Trendy.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> worked nicely for us.  </li>
            <li> Fully waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is balanced and so it feels nice in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure there is some attraction to being a haggard caveman, but there is more to being impeccably groomed and that starts with your BODY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> good:&lt;br /&gt;- WONDERFUL back extension that is super sturdy and the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br</li>
            <li> This groomer makes it very easy to handle that issue by myself.</li>
            <li> He thought the reach on the extension was perfect and was amazed at how far he could reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems useful, but I don&#x27;t use it so it just takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool that helps me get the positive impression I want from the lady in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li> Now that he&#x27;s figured out which trimmer attachment is best for him, next time will be a breeze.</li>
            <li> Glad to say, he didn&#x27;t get one nick or cut.</li>
            <li> I think this Philips Bodygroomer 3100 is simply fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think this Philips Bodygroomer 3100 is simply fantastic!</li>
            <li> That went okay.</li>
            <li> Best is that when they do need replacing the price is quite low and the interchange is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a nice fit.  </li>
            <li> Most people probably order this to shave their backs as it shows in the photo and describes in the description but that is not why I decided  to try out the shaver.</li>
            <li> We love the Bodygroomer for so many reasons.</li>
            <li> love how well the razor fits in your hand.</li>
            <li> He liked how secure the razor fits in the extension holder.</li>
            <li> The clips can be put on in either top or bottom orientation depending on how you prefer to hold the razor and depending on what area of your body you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> With the attachable combs it is simple to get the perfect trim of beards everytime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple months to use this groomer now and think it is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I feel a lot more confident now as a runner who jogs 25 miles per week with no shirt on.  </li>
            <li> and I can see much better.</li>
            <li> love it and would recommend it to any woman looking for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I think my wife loves this groomer more than I do, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Is very powerful!  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, safe and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, safe and</li>
            <li> This is also great for young teens with body hair issues as it&#x27;s really safe to use too.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean between uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They say it&#x27;s good to be pure of body, mind and spirit.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a convenient charging cradle and (more importantly)</li>
            <li> consider this trimmer an indispensable tool now, and easily recommend it as a fantastic solution to self-shave body hair!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been doing his own manscaping without the right tools.</li>
            <li> found the extension handle made for an easy reach, but also made the trimmer clumsier to use.</li>
            <li> It is truly easy to use and grab.</li>
            <li> It is easily used as a hand tool but also comes with a sturdy attachment to get those spots your arms are not made to reach.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver it to get to all the areas I want</li>
            <li> works fine but doesnt cut so neatly,, it leaves some pits here and there..</li>
            <li> Presumably this is best used for grooming sensitive areas - especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at thinning the forest - but I have gotten good results without using the guide.  </li>
            <li> He actually thought it  worked quite well trimming his beard, but didn&#x27;t work great for shaving his face.</li>
            <li> but my man lightly sprayed WD40 on the head after rinsing – but then he puts WD40 on everything that has mechanical parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The parts and attachments feel cheap and breakable (made in China).</li>
            <li> It gets the job done leaving the area closely shaved and smooth with no fear of a \\&quot;gotcha!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the overall results, and for the sensitive areas, it is the best product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I can tell how smooth it is just from your hand wiping it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The groomer snaps into the folding extension and stays securely in it.</li>
            <li> plastic combs are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I opened the shaver, I thought &#x27;Great, another clamshell package that I&#x27;m going to have to struggle with to get open.</li>
            <li> 45 day risk-free trial&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great, portable shaver that&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic groomer.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I really was quite pleased with this as I was able to shave my legs quickly and the best part -- no nicks or missed areas from the usual razor technique I&#x27;ve been using in the shower for many years.</li>
            <li> The extender is very handy when trying to reach your shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Clean, smooth shave feeling when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li> If you want a quick, easy, efficient way to control body hair, this works.</li>
            <li> To optimize battery life, instructions state that after the first charge it&#x27;s best to continue to use the groomer until the battery is completely empty before recharging &amp; DO NOT keep it permanently plugged in.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco recognizes this and the unique needs for shaving beyond the face with their Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more fond of their other body groomers which were more effective with men&#x27;s hair in the shower</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t grow a lot of hair but likes it clean.</li>
            <li> but you must clean the head every minute</li>
            <li> They are great if you use them every single day.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars due to the fact that some areas of the face/neck will require a finishing touch up with a real razor for the perfect clean look.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer should be great; it&#x27;s cordless, can be operated in wet conditions, and has a handle to help get to those out of reach</li>
            <li> is more suitable to following peaks and valleys.  </li>
            <li> His chest hair is nice and even, and it feels soft to the touch rather than blunt or prickly.  </li>
            <li> The unit cleans up well under running water or shaken in a sink full or tepid water.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of territory, and the Bodygroomer is ready for most of it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s waterproof which is really cool.  </li>
            <li> life;both will go for over an hour on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Cut and irritation level.  </li>
            <li> The Phillips Norcelco is a good body trainer for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> and I would love recommend it to anyone who wants to groom their body hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Full 2-year Warranty</li>
            <li> I find it more effective to just hold the main unit and reach as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charged quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I was mourning the fact that it hasn&#x27;t healed as quickly as it shroud, with the weather turning warmer and the sun shining brighter</li>
            <li> This particular shaver is more towards the precision end of things.  </li>
            <li> main unit itself is a slightly better grade of plastic, but does not provide any confidence in durability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected better honestly</li>
            <li> I also tested the MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Body Groomer and Trimmer which I found was much better at dealing with thicker hair and whose trimmer guides gave a much more even trim.</li>
            <li> excellent at reaching the middle back.  </li>
            <li> It has done a great job so far, is easy to clean, powerful enough, and versatile.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> The size of the shaver head was comfortable for maneuvering in that area and it worked out very well!</li>
            <li> Essentially identical to the very competent BG2028, the BG2034 adds an (optional) folding extension handle.</li>
            <li> Real easy to use especially on my back.  </li>
            <li> but overall I was very satisfied with the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The underarms area is pretty straightforward</li>
            <li> He felt it fit and and could be taken out with complete easy.</li>
            <li> Great for leaving a little bit of length on underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the 7100 may be worth the investment for people with the thickest body hair (it&#x27;s description suggests that) or it may go longer without needing to replace heads because it&#x27;s 2 sided, but in our house the lower priced 3100 model with the extender meets all of our needs.</li>

            <li> Better luck next time.ought cheaply.   </li>
            <li> worth noting that 50 minutes per charge is ample time to do the work I need to do.</li>
            <li> This product comes with an extension wand that you clip the razor into that will allow you to reach your back, and if you are brave and talented enough, the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Bodygroom 3100 delivers on its promise to give you a close and save shave in our most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It seems useful, but I don&#x27;t use it so it just takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The key to a nice shave, particularly in that sensitive area, seems to be keeping your skin pulled nice and taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is basically an update of the previous, hugely successful Philips Bodygroomer.  </li>
            <li> In other words, you save time and storage space since all you need to do is flip it upside-down, but it is longer than BG2034 and doesn&#x27;t fit quite as nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li> First a quick comment about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The battery is long lasting, it fits perfectly on our bathroom sink, is waterproof so it can go into the shower with you, and it shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> The price seems right for what you get.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> the clamshell opened right up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have a habit of not shaving on weekends and by Monday morning I have too much hair for the electric razor to shave cleanly.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver/groomer that you can take in the shower with you!  </li>
            <li> It seems pretty powerful and being cordless, which is a must, is helpful.</li>
            <li> Like the 3100, the 7100 operates so simply that he can select the length he wants and just pass the Bodygroomer over his own legs without help from mom or any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The 7100 has a more solid feel and the dual heads, but the differences may not be worth the premium price for a lot people.</li>
            <li> The 7100 has a more solid feel and the dual heads, but the differences may not be worth the premium price for a lot people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas - though you should still be careful -</li>
            <li> The 8100 is also much narrower, so it allows you to get into crevices and follow contours beyond the 3100&#x27;s reach, but requires more passes to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;-Long reach tool.  </li>
            <li> The handle is large enough that if you had someone with difficulty grasping the slender handles on a traditional razor this product might be a great gift for them as well.</li>
            <li> so the first thing he did was use it for trimming his beard and shaving his face despite the fact it&#x27;s not made for the face.</li>
            <li> I feel an elderly person would not be able to get this open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty hairy dude.</li>
            <li> many years I&#x27;ve simply used my trusty Wahl clippers, some accessories, and trimming scissors to get the job done.</li>
            <li> First area I tried this on was my armpits.</li>
            <li> and we have the first problem.</li>
            <li> Better luck next time.</li>
            <li> She has told me more than once, &amp;#34;You need to do something about that hair&amp;#34; and she was referring to a patch of hair on my back.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroomer by Philips Norelco is the first body shaver that convinced me to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have shaved him which he commented on when I gave the first swipe after I did one side.</li>
            <li> The first tweak extends the life of the product through an improved power button.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to tackle my underarms and groin area.</li>
            <li> I note that this can also be used in the shower, but I will probably use it outside of there as I like to be able to sit to shave</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It was fast and efficient, much faster than the previous best shaver I had for the same job.</li>
            <li> It works much much better than my previous &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; trimmer - which came for free with a set of buzz</li>
            <li> no irritation at all at least for me(kinda have sensitive skin) and the most good thing about that it give you smooth finish from the first trial no need to repeat on the same area.....</li>
            <li> It is powerful and I&#x27;m left with smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good enough for 10-15 sessions depending on how extensive they are.  </li>
            <li> Bodygroomer was pretty much over.</li>
            <li> have both, but if I had to choose, the 8100 is still my favorite as I do not need to fiddle with blade guards and the narrower head on the long hair trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer itself is really geared toward body hair and works pretty darn</li>
            <li> BG2034 is smaller, contoured to fit better in your hand, but you will need to switch plastic combs for different tasks.  </li>
            <li> how much you are willing to spend.</li>
            <li> extended handle, back shaving attachment, is not only great for reaching your back and shoulders, it&#x27;s also useful for anyone who has problems bending to shave their legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it easily shaved off the stray patches and tufts of hair he gets on his shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> it comes with makes it easy for one person to shave their back.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and cuts very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Power button is large and easily pressed while shaving (not an issue if you&#x27;re using the back extension)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It really makes shaving the back hair easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> he wants to groom.</li>
            <li> He also trimmed his legs and arms and that went fast</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bodygroomer is really for my wife.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally the shaver will pull at hairs and may take a couple passes to get a completely smooth feel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on you bathroom vanity or medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> My husband is a weight lifter and likes a smooth chest and back.</li>
            <li> Not working very well</li>
            <li> the folding extension wand has 7 locking (angled to straight) positions.</li>
            <li> These should be better even if it required a small increase in cost, it would be worth it to have higher quality combs</li>
            <li> Cuts real close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Where the Bodygroomer really struggles is with thicker hair and below the waist &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Bodygroom 3100 promises a safe and gentle trim for any area below the neck and offers flexibility with its three different comb attachments and an extension attachment to help you reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model uses a hard button on top of a rubber gasket, which has much better action and eliminates the faulty button design of the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used dry or wet, but dry skin and hair work best for us because water creates some resistance.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that these blades are self sharpening and is designed to reach areas that normally are not accessible by one person.  </li>
            <li> But if I use this groomer first, it cuts that facial hair shorter, not good enough for a shave, but it leaves it at a perfect length for my facial electric razor to finish the job for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> is ok, and did not fail while trying it, but because it just clocked in, I am just not comfortable using it often.</li>
            <li> tried on myself and it is very fast and efficient concerning complete hair removal....</li>
            <li> but it seemed to work better when the hair was dry which surprised both of us.</li>
            <li> I will compare this groomer to what was my previous favorite, the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased, but there is definitely room for improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may be wrong on this, but I believe the old battery was a NiCd, which is not an ideal battery technology.  </li>
            <li> The 8100 does not require you to change blade guards and limits the wear on the main blade, unlike the 3100.  </li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t need to use the extension for the back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fine for privates if you&#x27;re careful, even though the manual says not to.  </li>
            <li> : Comfortable trimming, multiple choices on cutting length, cordless, lightweight, easy to clean and -- here&#x27;s a big one -- the extension handle that enables you to trim your own back hair.</li>
            <li> In most cases, the long hair cutter works well to the transition to short hair</li>
            <li> I may not be able to bend down as far as I used to but the extender allows me to shave my legs without a lot of discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much destined to live my middling years keeping back my tuft of chest hair from linking up south of the Equator with the hairy rebels...</li>
            <li> This gadget is quite handy and is definitely easier to use to groom/remove body hair than just trying to use a typical electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but if you suddenly decide to shave your arms, legs, and torso, it&#x27;s probably not the right tool for the job.  </li>
            <li> Folks who are a larger size, or have very tight shoulders may find the extension handle more useful than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he does like to be able to tame the cave man</li>
            <li> Being a fan of using purpose-oriented devices I periodically wander over and try out new products.</li>
            <li> Like the new attachment.</li>
            <li> is that when my husband tried it on his face he didn&#x27;t think it left him as smooth as his traditional razor.</li>
            <li> The limitation - of course - is that some of those areas are very sensitive, and some of them may require the hair-cutting equivalent of a riding lawnmower.  </li>
            <li> This allows men or women to use it on various parts of their bodies to get exactly the shave desired.</li>
            <li> I love the close shave on dry, clean legs, and it took only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The update tweaks a number of design elements for the better, and now includes an extension arm for hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means I&#x27;d have to stop fairly frequently and unclog the trimmer</li>
            <li> Works very well for shaving sideburns and back hair.  </li>
            <li> , the silver is the old 2028).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from the handle, the unit is similar to the BG2028 in battery life and performance, and works very well.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re reasonably flexible, and/or have a medium build or smaller, chances are you don&#x27;t need the extension handle and can go with the cheaper BG2028.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the manual still recommends discharging the product completely before charging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my skin taut as far as I can.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s recommended to completely discharge the battery twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fail to mention that he was loving the results so much, he shaved his man parts.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but kind of regret buying it when a gap of the trimmer was broken explained a lot why it wasn&#x27;t working well on my arm.</li>
            <li> thin hair, like you&#x27;d find on your back or chest, the Bodygroomer does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> Like the older model, the included cutter doesn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as the replacement (&amp;#34;refill&amp;#34;) cutters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took me 10 minutes to do the whole thing including the chest and stomach plus an additional 2 to vacuum the area for any strays.</li>
            <li> It works mainly by the two &amp;#34;external&amp;#34; rows of cutters, so you need to position the shaver in such a way that those cutters are close to your skin.</li>
            <li> It does a excellent job at accomplishing what I was unable to do with other methods -- transforming my unsightly simian look into a human with just a bit of masculine hair in the proper places.</li>
            <li> Both leave a close and smooth cut with very little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge during a use which can easily exceed 10-15 minutes of constant heavy use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the knack of using the Bodygroomer because it&#x27;s ergonomically shaped and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It did not have the small pieces that require precise</li>
            <li> It took a full 8 hours to charge upon arrival (as advertised in the instructions), and then you&#x27;re supposed to use it until the battery is dead and charge again (presumably another 8 hours).</li>
            <li> We shave, we cut, we epilate, we wax, we trim, we tweeze, we pluck and now we take it a step further and go for the whole all over bodygroom, especially my husband.</li>
            <li> Or alternately, hold it from the very end for maximum reach, which is only usable &amp;#34;over the shoulder&amp;#34;, because of the curve of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This  trimmer just bogs down in my chest hair and started  pulling hairs almost right away.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 25-30 minutes to put on the cream, shave, repeatedly rinse wipe and clean off before putting on some cream for so</li>
            <li> The next problem is that the head gets clogged frequently and the trimmer just doesn&#x27;t have the power to push through.</li>
            <li> When the guys use this on their underarms it keeps things neat without looking bare.</li>
            <li> With or without the comb attachments, you must go over the area repeatedly to get a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic combs, holder and especially the back attachment are light precariously thin leaving</li>
            <li> It come also with 3 comb attachments so you can pick your poison of hair length from bare to visibly coiffed.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive areas might require extra care on the operator&#x27;s part and a bit of an acclimatization period, but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the biggest con I can say about it is that the sheering process irritates my sensitive skin a bit, but the red patches fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both work very well on your body hair with minimal nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Again, don&#x27;t expect a razor close shave, but you will remove tons of hair from hard to reach areas or large areas which will be free of razor burn and cuts, scratches or other irritation marks.</li>
            <li> I believe the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer can help with the first; the other two are up to you!</li>
            <li> big difference is the new (optional) extension handle, meant for trimming one&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> But they typically have longer lives and higher energy densities than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they typically have longer lives and higher energy densities than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cordless shaver and comes with a charger, an extender to reach your hairy back or butt, three comb attachments (that trim to 1/8&amp;#34;, 3/16&amp;#34; or 9/32&amp;#34;) to trim leg, underarm, chest, arm or other hair to varying hair lengths and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> that said, Philips Norelco has put together a decent trimmer package if you&#x27;re the type of guy with the proper (thin) hair or just need light trimming duty.</li>
            <li> This presents the problem of being in an area that is hard to reach or being dependent on a friendly mate to do the job for you.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it has the typical trimmer blade sections and also the screen covered shaver section which nearly eliminates the left over razor stubble.</li>
            <li> My son in his early teens hasn&#x27;t tried the 3100, but he has the more expensive Philips Bodygroomer 7100</li>
            <li> /&gt;In case you&#x27;re looking at both, the 7100 is heavier, shinier and has a lot of stainless steel, it has the shaver on one end and a separate trimmer on the other, it has a pivoting head and the trimmer is adjustable to 5 different lengths (not just 3).</li>
            <li> The Philips Bodygroomer attachments enable me to be precise with the length of hair left behind, and it always looks even and natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to shave down to smooth skin, but I also don&#x27;t like the prickly feeling I got from the short hairs left by using other methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We found that the hair was removed quickly and easily with no pulling or painful scraping.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it!and has a lot of stainless steel, it has the shaver on one end and a separate trimmer on the other, it has a pivoting head and the trimmer is adjustable to 5 different lengths (not just 3).</li>
            <li> Slick case, but adding a rubberized grip would be useful especially since it&#x27;s going to be used in the shower&lt;</li>
            <li> It cuts well without injury to sensitive areas, and its near omni-directional head provides versatility for some tight body spaces.  </li>
            <li> That is good and bad, as it&#x27;s easier to use this way, but it means storing another item.</li>
            <li> This is a good solution to something of an issue for me: cutting back the curly thatch of hair on my chest and trimming down the hair on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> See pics of the two models side-by-side (the black is the new BG2034</li>
            <li> Being the man he is, of course he didn&#x27;t read directions (no slight meant against other men, it&#x27;s just my husband</li>
            <li> The blades are self-sharpening and seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> (ie: beard), but there will be times when a long hair gets caught in the short cutter and pulled out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with three comb attachments depending on how far down you want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s in less frequently trimmed areas or even just folks with thinner hair to begin with this trimmer would suffice.</li>
            <li> The attachment guard sizes are what you&#x27;d expect to find on a standard hair trimmer; my one complaint is that the plastic seems very flimsy on the attachment guards.</li>

            <li> There is no such thing as getting all hairs in a single stroke!</li>
            <li> as soon as I started using this trimmer is that it&#x27;s just not up to the task of cutting most of my body hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really optimal to &amp;#34;mascape&amp;#34; with the same razor/ trimmer that you use on your face.</li>
            <li> Trim long body hair using one of the trimmers before trying to shave it.</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 different comb attachments for different lengths of grooming and a long handle attachment to get to hard to reach areas such as your back</li>
            <li> I focused on my arm hair with the 1/8&amp;#34; attachment (my hairy arms were just long enough for it to work) and other hair</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use any attachments other then the back one</li>
            <li> The extension makes the very center of my back a little easier, but makes all the rest more difficult.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to use mine out of the shower or dry.  </li>
            <li> When finished using, just rinse the head under running water and allow to dry.</li>
            <li> Some stubble is left behind, which requires additional shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer also did not work very well with beard hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a face shaver, but not far away either, and leaves only a slight feeling of stubble after trimming.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have the groomer loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed for the neck down and not intended for facial hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use the groomer on either wet or dry skin</li>
            <li> product, similar to the previous model, performs rather well.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the shaver head has both a typical electric razor screen area and double headed trim areas.</li>
            <li> I have several razors that do well on my cheeks, but less well on the jaw line, underside of jaw, and neck.  </li>
            <li> Go slow over sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> If I were to have a suggestion for a future one, it would be that I would like it to have a little vacuum on it so that it doesn&#x27;t make so much mess.  </li>
            <li> I hurt my back a little over a month ago</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any regrets using the Bodygroomer anywhere on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please be careful and demand 100%</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t help things and the results are often uneven, often requiring several passes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace an older shaver that I have had for years and that needed a blade change for an approximately comparable price to this item.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening!</li>
            <li> The razor head has a long hair cutting surface on the top and bottom to allow multiple angles of attack and a short hair cutting face in between.  </li>
            <li> I have had my share of nicks and \\&quot;ouches\\&quot; with other products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> you feel like they will break if you do not exercise extreme care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Self-sharpening blades require no maintenance other than rinsing out between uses.</li>
            <li> When used, I did not get razor burn as I have with other products that.  </li>
            <li> The advantage of BG2040 is that it has body trimmer on one end and a detailer on the other, which can be convenient for some.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged in a VERY heavy duty plastic clam shell that you need sharp, sturdy scissors to open.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing is a little bag to hold all the accessories</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the back attachment allows you to reach lower down the back, it is difficult to apply the correct pressure and angle to actually get the shave done.  </li>
            <li> But then again, I&#x27;ve offset my strength training (which makes for poor reach from tight muscles) with yoga training, so I can reach my back easily enough from either side.</li>
            <li> This cordless shaver comes with a telescoping holder which enables the Bodygroomer to get to hard to reach places (like on your back or shoulders).</li>
            <li> this is an average trimmer as it misses a lot of hair while I try to groom my body .</li>

            <li> a switchblade like extendable arm that holds the trimmer, folds for transport, then extends about a foot and a half to help the trimmer reach every little area of your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unpackaging the product was a bit of a surprise, as the razor in the box is tightly packed in a plastic container that needs to be cut.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but not super convenient, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Unwanted hair is a big deal in my house. We shave, we cut, we epilate, we wax, we trim, we tweeze, we pluck and now we take it a step further and go for the whole all over bodygroom, especially my husband. The Philips Bodygroom System 3100 is a total winner. It&#x27;s designed for the neck down and not intended for facial hair. It&#x27;s a cordless shaver and comes with a charger, an extender to reach your hairy back or butt, three comb attachments (that trim to 1/8&amp;#34;, 3/16&amp;#34; or 9/32&amp;#34;) to trim leg, underarm, chest, arm or other hair to varying hair lengths and a cleaning brush. There&#x27;s no sharpening involved, and it&#x27;s recommended you change the shaver head only about once a year. It can be used dry or wet, but dry skin and hair work best for us because water creates some resistance. Without a trimming attachment, it&#x27;s a shaver.  It charges well, one charge lasts about 45-50 minutes, and it comes with a generous 2.5 year warranty if you register online. It has a 45 day money back guarantee too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my husband is the hairiest in the house. He&#x27;s been doing his own manscaping without the right tools. He&#x27;s been using scissors, a razor and Wahl beard trimmer for his handiwork, and it&#x27;s a lot of work and produces uneven results. Also, he can&#x27;t reach everywhere he wants to groom. And while he looks great, using the Wahl beard trimmer on his chest leaves the ends of his chest hair blunt and prickly. So the minute the Philips Bodygroomer hit the house he was a man with a mission. Being the man he is, of course he didn&#x27;t read directions (no slight meant against other men, it&#x27;s just my husband I&#x27;m sure) so the first thing he did was use it for trimming his beard and shaving his face despite the fact it&#x27;s not made for the face. He actually thought it  worked quite well trimming his beard, but didn&#x27;t work great for shaving his face. Well, now that he&#x27;s been scolded, I mean told, that it&#x27;s not designed for the face, he won&#x27;t be shaving with it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He moved on to the body parts that the Bodygroomer is designed for and using it was easy, and he got great results. He&#x27;s moderately hairy and it easily shaved off the stray patches and tufts of hair he gets on his shoulders and back. The extension for the back worked well. It even works for your rear end. He experimented with the different trimmer attachments and found medium the best for his chest and got great results! His chest hair is nice and even, and it feels soft to the touch rather than blunt or prickly.  He also trimmed his legs and arms and that went fast and they look awesome. He did have to pass the Bodygroomer over some body parts more than once to get even good results. Now that he&#x27;s figured out which trimmer attachment is best for him, next time will be a breeze. I can&#x27;t fail to mention that he was loving the results so much, he shaved his man parts. The size of the shaver head was comfortable for maneuvering in that area and it worked out very well! Glad to say, he didn&#x27;t get one nick or cut. The key to a nice shave, particularly in that sensitive area, seems to be keeping your skin pulled nice and taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Bodygroomer, and it glides nicely over areas I trimmed. I focused on my arm hair with the 1/8&amp;#34; attachment (my hairy arms were just long enough for it to work) and other hair I&#x27;d rather not discuss in detail. The Bodygroomer works great and is so easy to use. This is also great for young teens with body hair issues as it&#x27;s really safe to use too. My son in his early teens hasn&#x27;t tried the 3100, but he has the more expensive Philips Bodygroomer 7100 we got him when he was self conscious after growing long dark leg hair. Like the 3100, the 7100 operates so simply that he can select the length he wants and just pass the Bodygroomer over his own legs without help from mom or any nicks or cuts. In hindsight, I don&#x27;t know why we didn&#x27;t get him this 3100 model which is $30 cheaper and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re looking at both, the 7100 is heavier, shinier and has a lot of stainless steel, it has the shaver on one end and a separate trimmer on the other, it has a pivoting head and the trimmer is adjustable to 5 different lengths (not just 3). It doesn&#x27;t have the extender like the 3100. The 7100 has a more solid feel and the dual heads, but the differences may not be worth the premium price for a lot people. I think the 7100 may be worth the investment for people with the thickest body hair (it&#x27;s description suggests that) or it may go longer without needing to replace heads because it&#x27;s 2 sided, but in our house the lower priced 3100 model with the extender meets all of our needs. I think this Philips Bodygroomer 3100 is simply fantastic! It&#x27;s easy to use, safe and the results are really great.

            <li> Great little shaver/groomer that you can take in the shower with you!  It comes with 3 different comb attachments for different lengths of grooming and a long handle attachment to get to hard to reach areas such as your back or if you don&#x27;t want to bend while shaving your legs.  It is powerful and I&#x27;m left with smooth skin.  Four stars instead of five because of the packaging.  It was packaged in a VERY heavy duty plastic clam shell that you need sharp, sturdy scissors to open.  I feel an elderly person would not be able to get this open and I even struggled with it and actually broke the handle of my scissors.  Be careful when opening!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty hairy dude. Can&#x27;t be helped. My family line is Spanish and German so yeah I&#x27;m pretty much destined to live my middling years keeping back my tuft of chest hair from linking up south of the Equator with the hairy rebels... er, you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I&#x27;ve simply used my trusty Wahl clippers, some accessories, and trimming scissors to get the job done. For the most part that combination has worked great. Being a fan of using purpose-oriented devices I periodically wander over and try out new products. The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer should be great; it&#x27;s cordless, can be operated in wet conditions, and has a handle to help get to those out of reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem though as soon as I started using this trimmer is that it&#x27;s just not up to the task of cutting most of my body hair. First area I tried this on was my armpits. I&#x27;m not looking for baby-smooth; just a trim. That went okay. Next up, chesthair and we have the first problem. This  trimmer just bogs down in my chest hair and started  pulling hairs almost right away. The next problem is that the head gets clogged frequently and the trimmer just doesn&#x27;t have the power to push through. That means I&#x27;d have to stop fairly frequently and unclog the trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point my trimming adventure with the 3100 Bodygroomer was pretty much over. No way I was going to take this trimmer for a spin down south with it pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think on thinner hair that&#x27;s in less frequently trimmed areas or even just folks with thinner hair to begin with this trimmer would suffice. But for us hairy dudes this won&#x27;t do at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, Philips Norelco has put together a decent trimmer package if you&#x27;re the type of guy with the proper (thin) hair or just need light trimming duty. You&#x27;ll get a fully cordless trimmer that can operate for about 50-minutes on battery power; three different trimmer heads; and a charger stand. No lubricant is included in this package but can be bought cheaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes and coarse hair I&#x27;ll be sticking it out with my trusty Wahl clippers for now. Better luck next time.ought cheaply.   For my purposes and coarse hair I&#x27;ll be sticking it out with my trusty Wahl clippers for now. Better luck next time.</li>
            <li> This bodygroomer is really for my wife. She has told me more than once, &amp;#34;You need to do something about that hair&amp;#34; and she was referring to a patch of hair on my back. I am not a hairy guy, but I have a few spots that need attention. My lower back is one of those areas. This groomer makes it very easy to handle that issue by myself. And with warm weather arriving, might as well keep everything look neat and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face. I use an electric razor. They are great if you use them every single day. But I have a habit of not shaving on weekends and by Monday morning I have too much hair for the electric razor to shave cleanly. I end up getting about 85% of it, then have to follow up with a razor. But if I use this groomer first, it cuts that facial hair shorter, not good enough for a shave, but it leaves it at a perfect length for my facial electric razor to finish the job for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Body groomer is not made for facial hair.  It’s specifically designed and marketed for body grooming.  My man has the specific problem of having fur shoulders.  This presents the problem of being in an area that is hard to reach or being dependent on a friendly mate to do the job for you.  We found that the hair was removed quickly and easily with no pulling or painful scraping.  With the back attachment it is now a one person job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the groomer on either wet or dry skin but it seemed to work better when the hair was dry which surprised both of us. The blades are self-sharpening and seem to last a long time.  Best is that when they do need replacing the price is quite low and the interchange is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are the combs that let you trim from about ¼ inch to 1 inch.  When the guys use this on their underarms it keeps things neat without looking bare. It is designed for all areas that need trimming from the neck to the feet.  The unit cleans up well under running water or shaken in a sink full or tepid water. I don’t know if this is a good idea or not but my man lightly sprayed WD40 on the head after rinsing – but then he puts WD40 on everything that has mechanical parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both getting up there in years and he’s never been into the hairless beach bum look but he does like to be able to tame the cave man look a little.  It seems that this Norelco Groomer lets you go either way.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer. It&#x27;s a great tool that helps me get the positive impression I want from the lady in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroomer includes attachments for controlling the length of the cut. Presumably this is best used for grooming sensitive areas - especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at thinning the forest - but I have gotten good results without using the guide.  It doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the knack of using the Bodygroomer because it&#x27;s ergonomically shaped and gentle on the skin. Still, it might be a good idea to start on chest, arms or legs before trying to use it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting that 50 minutes per charge is ample time to do the work I need to do. I haven&#x27;t had any regrets using the Bodygroomer anywhere on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it&#x27;s good to be pure of body, mind and spirit.  I believe the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer can help with the first; the other two are up to you!</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great brand and easy to use.  It charged quickly.  Has a nice fit.  Is very powerful!  Works very well for shaving sideburns and back hair.  It comes with 3 different depth combs.  Also worked very nice on neck hair.  The back piece it comes with makes it easy for one person to shave their back.  Works well to trim all parts of the body.  My husband really likes it.  He uses it on his face as well even though it is a body trimmer.  It gives him a close smoth shave without nicking him!</li>
            <li> This is a good solution to something of an issue for me: cutting back the curly thatch of hair on my chest and trimming down the hair on my shoulders. It does a excellent job at accomplishing what I was unable to do with other methods -- transforming my unsightly simian look into a human with just a bit of masculine hair in the proper places. I don&#x27;t want to shave down to smooth skin, but I also don&#x27;t like the prickly feeling I got from the short hairs left by using other methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used scissors and hair-trimming flip-ups on my electric shavers, and I invariably would get a very uneven and unnatural look, sometimes cutting myself in the process. The Philips Bodygroomer attachments enable me to be precise with the length of hair left behind, and it always looks even and natural. And I&#x27;ve yet to get cut or feel a pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Comfortable trimming, multiple choices on cutting length, cordless, lightweight, easy to clean and -- here&#x27;s a big one -- the extension handle that enables you to trim your own back hair. I never think about back hair until I see a photo of myself from behind in swim trunks. Yuck. Now I can do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The parts and attachments feel cheap and breakable (made in China). Also, charging is a bit of an issue. It took a full 8 hours to charge upon arrival (as advertised in the instructions), and then you&#x27;re supposed to use it until the battery is dead and charge again (presumably another 8 hours). Not a huge deal, but not super convenient, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The price seems right for what you get. If you want a quick, easy, efficient way to control body hair, this works.</li>
            <li> Am returning the item</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace an older shaver that I have had for years and that needed a blade change for an approximately comparable price to this item.  I liked the fact that these blades are self sharpening and is designed to reach areas that normally are not accessible by one person.  This product comes with an extension wand that you clip the razor into that will allow you to reach your back, and if you are brave and talented enough, the back of your neck.  The razor is designed to be ergonomic a feels really good in my hand and will allow for use of up to 50 minutes or so on a charge.  The razor head has a long hair cutting surface on the top and bottom to allow multiple angles of attack and a short hair cutting face in between.  In most cases, the long hair cutter works well to the transition to short hair (ie: beard), but there will be times when a long hair gets caught in the short cutter and pulled out.  I gave this 4 stars due to the fact that some areas of the face/neck will require a finishing touch up with a real razor for the perfect clean look.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroomer by Philips Norelco is the first body shaver that convinced me to try it out. Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased, but there is definitely room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- WONDERFUL back extension that is super sturdy and the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;- Clean, smooth shave feeling when you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable, waterproof body&lt;br /&gt;- Replaceable foil / shave head&lt;br /&gt;- Handles long, short, thick, and thin hair well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could use improvement:&lt;br /&gt;- Slick case, but adding a rubberized grip would be useful especially since it&#x27;s going to be used in the shower&lt;br /&gt;- Power button is large and easily pressed while shaving (not an issue if you&#x27;re using the back extension)&lt;br /&gt;- It would be nice if the head flexed a bit to make getting into nooks and crannies easier&lt;br /&gt;- Occasionally the shaver will pull at hairs and may take a couple passes to get a completely smooth feel. Go slow over sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> Most people probably order this to shave their backs as it shows in the photo and describes in the description but that is not why I decided  to try out the shaver. I hurt my back a little over a month ago and I was mourning the fact that it hasn&#x27;t healed as quickly as it shroud, with the weather turning warmer and the sun shining brighter I knew shorts were in my future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Notekoc thinking that maybe the curve of the handle and the extension may be my saving grace and I was right. I may not be able to bend down as far as I used to but the extender allows me to shave my legs without a lot of discomfort. Not only can this product be used to manscape your husband&#x27;s back but can save you some pain and embarrassment as well. The handle is large enough that if you had someone with difficulty grasping the slender handles on a traditional razor this product might be a great gift for them as well. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product and gave it 4 stars is that when my husband tried it on his face he didn&#x27;t think it left him as smooth as his traditional razor. Overall, a nice product and worth the money. It seems pretty powerful and being cordless, which is a must, is helpful. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on you bathroom vanity or medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer describes itself as a &amp;#34;below the neck&amp;#34; shaver.  This is a lot of territory, and the Bodygroomer is ready for most of it.  The limitation - of course - is that some of those areas are very sensitive, and some of them may require the hair-cutting equivalent of a riding lawnmower.  This particular shaver is more towards the precision end of things.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas - though you should still be careful - but if you suddenly decide to shave your arms, legs, and torso, it&#x27;s probably not the right tool for the job.  It works much much better than my previous &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; trimmer - which came for free with a set of buzz clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a specialized device for specific needs, it definitely earns a place on my bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> Essentially identical to the very competent BG2028, the BG2034 adds an (optional) folding extension handle. The charger, design, type of blade, and power input are all the same. See pics of the two models side-by-side (the black is the new BG2034, the silver is the old 2028).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big difference is the new (optional) extension handle, meant for trimming one&#x27;s back. The extension folds open and locks into place. The base trimmer then snaps into the end of the extension handle. You can grasp the extension at the middle joint, which handles like an extended version of the trimmer. Or alternately, hold it from the very end for maximum reach, which is only usable &amp;#34;over the shoulder&amp;#34;, because of the curve of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the extension handle made for an easy reach, but also made the trimmer clumsier to use. But then again, I&#x27;ve offset my strength training (which makes for poor reach from tight muscles) with yoga training, so I can reach my back easily enough from either side. The extension makes the very center of my back a little easier, but makes all the rest more difficult. So, I don&#x27;t bother with the extension. Folks who are a larger size, or have very tight shoulders may find the extension handle more useful than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the handle, the unit is similar to the BG2028 in battery life and performance, and works very well. Like the older model, the included cutter doesn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as the replacement (&amp;#34;refill&amp;#34;) cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I award 5 stars since the BG2034 works just as well as its predecessor. But if you&#x27;re reasonably flexible, and/or have a medium build or smaller, chances are you don&#x27;t need the extension handle and can go with the cheaper BG2028.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Bodygroom 3100 promises a safe and gentle trim for any area below the neck and offers flexibility with its three different comb attachments and an extension attachment to help you reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom 3100 delivers on its promise to give you a close and save shave in our most sensitive areas.  I have had my share of nicks and \\&quot;ouches\\&quot; with other products, but not this one.  It gets the job done leaving the area closely shaved and smooth with no fear of a \\&quot;gotcha!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some effort to get the desired result on the chest, abdomen and back.  With or without the comb attachments, you must go over the area repeatedly to get a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic combs, holder and especially the back attachment are light precariously thin leaving you feel like they will break if you do not exercise extreme care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main unit itself is a slightly better grade of plastic, but does not provide any confidence in durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the back attachment allows you to reach lower down the back, it is difficult to apply the correct pressure and angle to actually get the shave done.  I find it more effective to just hold the main unit and reach as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the issues with craftsmanship, it does get the job done.  I am satisfied with the overall results, and for the sensitive areas, it is the best product I&#x27;ve found.  The quality of the product is lacking and the back attachment not that helpful.</li>
            <li> this is an average trimmer as it misses a lot of hair while I try to groom my body .</li>
            <li> We love the Bodygroomer for so many reasons. My husband is a weight lifter and likes a smooth chest and back. Every Sunday we grab a razor, bucket of water, shaving cream and multiple towels so that I can shave his back, and shoulders. He does his stomach and chest himself. He doesn&#x27;t grow a lot of hair but likes it clean. It usually takes me about 25-30 minutes to put on the cream, shave, repeatedly rinse wipe and clean off before putting on some cream for so he doesn&#x27;t get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend it took me 10 minutes to do the whole thing including the chest and stomach plus an additional 2 to vacuum the area for any strays. Only 12 minutes without the clean-up of towels, cream, dumping the water and cleaning out the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love how well the razor fits in your hand. It is truly easy to use and grab. It can be used in the shower as well which he will probably do from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three comb attachments depending on how far down you want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t use any attachments other then the back one so he could try it out. He liked how secure the razor fits in the extension holder. He felt it fit and and could be taken out with complete easy. He thought the reach on the extension was perfect and was amazed at how far he could reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was way smoother than anytime I have shaved him which he commented on when I gave the first swipe after I did one side. &amp;#34;I can tell how smooth it is just from your hand wiping it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We give it 5 stars for ease of use, quality of razor and results</li>
            <li> Very good product with a nicely finished look.&lt;br /&gt;I tried on myself and it is very fast and efficient concerning complete hair removal....no irritation at all at least for me(kinda have sensitive skin) and the most good thing about that it give you smooth finish from the first trial no need to repeat on the same area.....i like it and it is very easy and the extended arm is awesome.</li>
            <li> works fine but doesnt cut so neatly,, it leaves some pits here and there..</li>
            <li> Not working very well</li>
            <li> This product is basically an update of the previous, hugely successful Philips Bodygroomer.  For those unfamiliar, it features an omni-directional, replaceable cutting head, 3 size clips, a waterproof design and rechargeable battery.  The update tweaks a number of design elements for the better, and now includes an extension arm for hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, similar to the previous model, performs rather well.  It cuts well without injury to sensitive areas, and its near omni-directional head provides versatility for some tight body spaces.  Battery life is good enough for 10-15 sessions depending on how extensive they are.  I prefer just using it for 2 minute upkeep sessions so I only have to charge it once every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, this update features a number of tweaks over the previous version.  The first tweak extends the life of the product through an improved power button.  The previous model used a button hidden behind a rubber membrane that would often get stuck into position and make it impossible to turn off.  This model uses a hard button on top of a rubber gasket, which has much better action and eliminates the faulty button design of the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size clips are also easier to remove.  Previously removing a clip would cause the cutting head to pop off.  Now the clips can be removed without interfering with the cutting head.  The clips can be put on in either top or bottom orientation depending on how you prefer to hold the razor and depending on what area of your body you&#x27;re grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be wrong on this, but I believe the old battery was a NiCd, which is not an ideal battery technology.  The battery in this product is NiMH, which doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues of NiCd.  Regardless, the manual still recommends discharging the product completely before charging.  I don&#x27;t actually think that&#x27;s necessary since NiMH doesn&#x27;t have memory issues.  NiMH usually suffers from shelf-life issues where the battery continuously discharges even when not in use.  But they typically have longer lives and higher energy densities than NiCd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also includes an extension arm that can be used for hard to reach areas like backs.  You simply slap the razor into the arm, choose your angle and have at it.  It seems useful, but I don&#x27;t use it so it just takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.issues where the battery continuously discharges even when not in use.

            <li> Works pretty good. There is no such thing as getting all hairs in a single stroke! This gadget is quite handy and is definitely easier to use to groom/remove body hair than just trying to use a typical electric shaver. It is great if you are prone to ingrown hairs with blade shaving, but of course it does not provide the silky skin feel that razor shaving does. With the attachable combs it is simple to get the perfect trim of beards everytime. I also like that the shaver head has both a typical electric razor screen area and double headed trim areas.The groomer snaps into the folding extension and stays securely in it. the folding extension wand has 7 locking (angled to straight) positions. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had a couple months to use this groomer now and think it is fabulous! Again, don&#x27;t expect a razor close shave, but you will remove tons of hair from hard to reach areas or large areas which will be free of razor burn and cuts, scratches or other irritation marks. I really like that it has the typical trimmer blade sections and also the screen covered shaver section which nearly eliminates the left over razor stubble. To the naked eye, it appears that there never was hair on the groomed body areas. I have yet to have the groomer loose it&#x27;s charge during a use which can easily exceed 10-15 minutes of constant heavy use.</li>
            <li> Sure there is some attraction to being a haggard caveman, but there is more to being impeccably groomed and that starts with your BODY HAIR.  There, I said it.  I tried this shaver and was wowed by its effectiveness and flexibility.  It is easily used as a hand tool but also comes with a sturdy attachment to get those spots your arms are not made to reach.  It come also with 3 comb attachments so you can pick your poison of hair length from bare to visibly coiffed.  Have no fear for your manliness!  You&#x27;ll feel cleaner, look nicer and maybe even they&#x27;ll invite you into the Illuminati.  Who knows what wonders will occur when you look impeccable!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Sleek &amp; Trendy. Best body groomer i have used so for.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  It really makes shaving the back hair easy and fast.  I feel a lot more confident now as a runner who jogs 25 miles per week with no shirt on.  And it&#x27;s waterproof which is really cool.  Before this I was using razors and it was such a hassle.  I also used it to shave off my beard even though the package says it&#x27;s not for faces.  I still had to finish up with a razor, but it gave me a great start.  It&#x27;s also fine for privates if you&#x27;re careful, even though the manual says not to.  Very easy to clean between uses.  Self-sharpening blades require no maintenance other than rinsing out between uses.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but kind of regret buying it when a gap of the trimmer was broken explained a lot why it wasn&#x27;t working well on my arm. Please be careful and demand 100%</li>
            <li> plastic combs are cheaply made.  These should be better even if it required a small increase in cost, it would be worth it to have higher quality combs</li>
            <li> I have several razors that do well on my cheeks, but less well on the jaw line, underside of jaw, and neck.  For those areas nothing beats the body groomer with the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replaces an earlier model I have been using in the same way for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason why you can&#x27;t also use the body groomer with the shaving head on your face rather than switch between the shaving devices.  When in a hurry I sometimes use the body groomer to shave the entire face and neck.  After my face got accustomed to  being shaved by the body groomer, it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than when using the razor after I put the after shave.</li>
            <li> Great body grooming machine.  Real easy to use especially on my back.  Cuts real close with no irritation. Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine&lt;br /&gt;But not blown away I expected better honestly</li>
            <li> I will compare this groomer to what was my previous favorite, the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom 7100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Similarities:&lt;br /&gt;-Quality construction, same manufacturer, no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life;both will go for over an hour on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Cut and irritation level.  Both leave a close and smooth cut with very little to no irritation.  Sensitive areas might require extra care on the operator&#x27;s part and a bit of an acclimatization period, but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences:&lt;br /&gt;-Method of trimming longer hair.  The 8100 has a completely different trimmer on the bottom end, with a built-in depth of cut adjustment.  The 8100 does not require you to change blade guards and limits the wear on the main blade, unlike the 3100.  The 8100 is also much narrower, so it allows you to get into crevices and follow contours beyond the 3100&#x27;s reach, but requires more passes to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;-Long reach tool.  The 3100 comes with one that it snaps into, the 8100 does not.&lt;br /&gt;-Cost.  About 20-30$ in favor of the 3100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both, but if I had to choose, the 8100 is still my favorite as I do not need to fiddle with blade guards and the narrower head on the long hair trimmer is more suitable to following peaks and valleys.  That being said, the 3100 beats it out for the back, and for value.</li>
            <li> This an excellent body grooming razor.  The battery is long lasting, it fits perfectly on our bathroom sink, is waterproof so it can go into the shower with you, and it shaves very well.  I tried it both in the shower and out and I prefer to use mine out of the shower or dry.  The razor did pull a little on a few hairs (and I&#x27;m not a hairy man) but overall I was very satisfied with the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good body groomer to shave off unwanted hair, this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really optimal to &amp;#34;mascape&amp;#34; with the same razor/ trimmer that you use on your face. The Philips Norelco recognizes this and the unique needs for shaving beyond the face with their Bodygroomer. This cordless shaver comes with a telescoping holder which enables the Bodygroomer to get to hard to reach places (like on your back or shoulders). The shaver comes with several different attachments for different levels of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On thin hair, like you&#x27;d find on your back or chest, the Bodygroomer does a fairly good job. The combination of trimmer and microscreen does well with getting a solid shave, even with longer hair. Where the Bodygroomer really struggles is with thicker hair and below the waist &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;. Here it&#x27;s underpowered and cuts poorly. The attachments don&#x27;t help things and the results are often uneven, often requiring several passes. I also tested the MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Body Groomer and Trimmer which I found was much better at dealing with thicker hair and whose trimmer guides gave a much more even trim.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norcelco is a good body trainer for coarse hair. It did not so well with some of the softer style hair. That type of hair requires a few times to go over the patch of hair. Also to note is that it does not a close shave. Some stubble is left behind, which requires additional shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer also did not work very well with beard hair. It did not have the small pieces that require precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;The handle to reach your back area is ok, and did not fail while trying it, but because it just clocked in, I am just not comfortable using it often.</li>
            <li> Fully met my expectations. Very nice gadget.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Truly the best I&#x27;ve tried. Does not cut you at all</li>
            <li> It was received with no issues.</li>
            <li> excellent at reaching the middle back.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy by any means, and my purpose for getting this shaver was to remove the hair from my underarms and groin area. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shavers in the past. If you opened my drawer, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;m a part-time barber with all the different kinds of &amp;#34;hair removal apparatus&amp;#34; I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished I had known about this shaver sooner. This shaver is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to tackle my underarms and groin area. For me, it works wonderfully. The underarms area is pretty straightforward so I won&#x27;t go into any details. For the groin area, this shaver works like a charm once you get the hang of it. It works mainly by the two &amp;#34;external&amp;#34; rows of cutters, so you need to position the shaver in such a way that those cutters are close to your skin. Otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my skin taut as far as I can. Guys, you know how the skin is like down there. I did get nicked once, but no blood at all. It was fast and efficient, much faster than the previous best shaver I had for the same job. With all the other shavers I&#x27;ve tried in the past, nicks and blood were a given.</li>
            <li> Great price point - not that good at dealing with body hair in the shower. I&#x27;m more fond of their other body groomers which were more effective with men&#x27;s hair in the shower</li>
            <li> Although this may be perceived as designed for men, I am thrilled with this shaver! I really was quite pleased with this as I was able to shave my legs quickly and the best part -- no nicks or missed areas from the usual razor technique I&#x27;ve been using in the shower for many years. I love the close shave on dry, clean legs, and it took only a few minutes. No need to buy shaving gel or replace those razor blades every week! I note that this can also be used in the shower, but I will probably use it outside of there as I like to be able to sit to shave and I can see much better. When finished using, just rinse the head under running water and allow to dry. There are 3 different combs that you can attach and the instruction booklet gives you guidelines as to which one to use depending on hair length and degree of trim you want. This allows men or women to use it on various parts of their bodies to get exactly the shave desired. The attachment for the back would be quite helpful to men who need to reach that area without assistance OR for women to reach to ankles from a standing position without having to bend over. There is also a cleaning brush included. The only thing missing is a little bag to hold all the accessories in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes well-packaged in that sealed hard, plastic wrap that requires a sturdy sharp scissors to get the unit out. The charging base has the AC adapter and it takes about 8 hours to get to a full charge. Once charged, it runs at speed for about an hour of grooming time. The unit is sleek and fits in my hand well so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver it to get to all the areas I want shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and would recommend it to any woman looking for an electric razor. It gives me a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming those, not so sightly, areas.  Luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t need to use the extension for the back so I can&#x27;t rate it on that.  When used, I did not get razor burn as I have with other products that.  It is very quiet and cuts very quickly.  If I were to have a suggestion for a future one, it would be that I would like it to have a little vacuum on it so that it doesn&#x27;t make so much mess.  Overall it works very good and I would love recommend it to anyone who wants to groom their body hair.</li>
            <li> This personal bodygroomer works ver well. The razor seems to have quite a bit of power, making trimming up a breeze. Unpackaging the product was a bit of a surprise, as the razor in the box is tightly packed in a plastic container that needs to be cut. It comes with a few guards, a brush for cleaning, and an extendable case. From the initial photos, I thought the razor may have something on it that flips open. Not so - it&#x27;s a separate item. That is good and bad, as it&#x27;s easier to use this way, but it means storing another item. The extender is very handy when trying to reach your shoulders and back. The charging base is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this groomer. It has done a great job so far, is easy to clean, powerful enough, and versatile.</li>
            <li> It would be faster rubbing an angry cat over my body. Took so long just to trim my armpits the shower went cold.</li>
            <li> I think my wife loves this groomer more than I do, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. She no longer gets asked to shave my back and...&lt;br /&gt;2. She no longer has to endure my jokes about our &amp;#34;romantic evening&amp;#34; of back shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is really geared toward body hair and works pretty darn well. It&#x27;s not as close as a face shaver, but not far away either, and leaves only a slight feeling of stubble after trimming. I used it to shave both my armpit hair and my back, and it took care of both area within minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a convenient charging cradle and (more importantly) a switchblade like extendable arm that holds the trimmer, folds for transport, then extends about a foot and a half to help the trimmer reach every little area of your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the biggest con I can say about it is that the sheering process irritates my sensitive skin a bit, but the red patches fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this trimmer an indispensable tool now, and easily recommend it as a fantastic solution to self-shave body hair!</li>
            <li> First a quick comment about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the shaver, I thought &#x27;Great, another clamshell package that I&#x27;m going to have to struggle with to get open.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;With scissors in hand, I&#x27;m checking the clamshell to decide where to begin. That&#x27;s when I noticed a cutting line which was defined by little scissor icons.&lt;br /&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief, followed the cutting line &amp; voila! the clamshell opened right up.&lt;br /&gt;You know sometimes it&#x27;s the little things in life that make your day. Seeing that cutting line made my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodygroomer arrived charged. To optimize battery life, instructions state that after the first charge it&#x27;s best to continue to use the groomer until the battery is completely empty before recharging &amp; DO NOT keep it permanently plugged in. Also it&#x27;s recommended to completely discharge the battery twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodygroomer is designed to be used from the neck down.  It is not to be used on your face or head. It comes with 3 different lengths of trimmers.  Trim long body hair using one of the trimmers before trying to shave it. Great for leaving a little bit of length on underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extended handle, back shaving attachment, is not only great for reaching your back and shoulders, it&#x27;s also useful for anyone who has problems bending to shave their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BG2034/42  worked nicely for us.  It was used on medium to coarse hair, medium thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 45 day risk-free trial&lt;br /&gt; Full 2-year Warranty</li>
            <li> This is a great, portable shaver that&#x27;s simple to use. It holds a charge for quite some time, too, making it perfect for travel. The body is sturdy (despite the plastic casing!), and the head moves somewhat to allow for contouring to skin. The attachment guard sizes are what you&#x27;d expect to find on a standard hair trimmer; my one complaint is that the plastic seems very flimsy on the attachment guards. Otherwise, this product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic groomer.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in the shower, wash it in the sink. Fully waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is balanced and so it feels nice in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;It is cordless.  I love the charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 2 years now and no issues.</li>
            <li> Worked great after 1st use.  Charges quickly.  This is my 2nd one.  Like the new attachment.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco BG2034/42 3100 Bodygroomer is a less expensive cousin of [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom 7100 (Packaging May Vary)]].  Both work very well on your body hair with minimal nicks and cuts.  The advantage of BG2040 is that it has body trimmer on one end and a detailer on the other, which can be convenient for some.  In other words, you save time and storage space since all you need to do is flip it upside-down, but it is longer than BG2034 and doesn&#x27;t fit quite as nicely in your hand.  BG2034 is smaller, contoured to fit better in your hand, but you will need to switch plastic combs for different tasks.  Whichever Norelco model you decide to use in the end is strictly up to you, but rest assured that you will not be disappointed with either and it comes down to your needs and how much you are willing to spend.</li>
