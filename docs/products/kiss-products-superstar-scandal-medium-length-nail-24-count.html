    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t damage my nails, and for the look they give, the amount of time involved (5 minutes for what looks like a salon gel manicure), and the price, its just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the looks of these nails and they gave me great looking nails on two occasions.  </li>
            <li>Not as good a product as I thought would be  ant use.</li>
            <li>and now my own nails have recovered they DO NOT damage your own nails fantastic product, happy user</li>
            <li>These nail covers looked nice in the package but they began popping off an hour after they were applied.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and the product - they stay on, look great, and feel fine.</li>
            <li>and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes you have to replace the ones on the fingers you use the most after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these nail.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more colors in medium.</li>
            <li>hope to have better luck this time because they are so easy and flexible.</li>
            <li>I like the easy application but some of the nails just don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>These nails worked great for me for a night out on the town and there were enough nails in the package that I was able to make two sets so I could wear them twice.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and remove with no nail polish remover required.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a convenient way to have beautiful nails in an instant.</li>
            <li>I did not give them only 1 star because I saved most of them and will try them again with nail glue tabs, and I frequently have excellent luck with keeping impress nails on that way.</li>
            <li>This is a great product when you can get the color you want, but they changed the color and kept the same name.</li>
            <li>I love impress on nail they stay on for 2 weeks if you correctly follow instructions and use the right size</li>
            <li>Love the ease of these things - save so much time!</li>
            <li>The ad photo shows the original color, which is (was) a frosty almost pearl like medium purple/grape color.</li>
            <li>But the price, and I don&#x27;t get two full sets out</li>
            <li>They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick.</li>
            <li>AND THEY WERE PRETTY , ITS MY FIRST PRESS ON NAIL</li>
            <li>I do not know whether the longer length made them more apt to pop, but they simply did not adhere, even though they were carefully applied according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these nails for future use.</li>
            <li>Easy last minute fill in ...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But really, for the money, five stars.  </li>
            <li>Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is a manufacturer issue, so this IS a product review and not a complaint or request (which I will file separately).</li>
            <li>I have a hard time keeping my nails long and looking good.  </li>
            <li>, BE SUPER CAREFUL WHEN WASHING HANDS</li>
            <li>but I did not like this color it thought is was going to be more of a dark red</li>
            <li>The nails in the picture look like a light purple, but the real color is a deep, dark burgundy.  </li>
            <li>but it still looks natural</li>
            <li>Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
            <li>I found that if you use nail polish remover on your nails (instead of that little pad they give you) before application, and right before bed, so that they can dry thoroughly, they will definitely last a full week.</li>
            <li>I bought the white french manicure with flowers and wore them for a week, and everyone thought they were real.  </li>
            <li>not everyone has tiny nails like a five year old.</li>
            <li>The package shows the same name and product code, and the manufacturer&#x27;s recently updated website shows the new color along with a non-functioning email contact address.</li>

            <li> it due to size shortages?</li>
            <li> Waste of money - can&#x27;t wear them.</li>
            <li> the widest nail you provide in the assortment hardly covers my thumb across it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the easy application but some of the nails just don&#x27;t stay on. Followed the directions faithfully too.  This is the third pair I&#x27;m trying...hope to have better luck this time because they are so easy and flexible. ALSO KISS LISTEN UP.... not everyone has tiny nails like a five year old. You need to make a larger/wider nails set. My nails and hands aren&#x27;t that big and the widest nail you provide in the assortment hardly covers my thumb across it.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of these things - save so much time!</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as I thought would be  ant use.</li>
            <li> I wore these for a week and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling. They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick. imPress nails damage your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend to ANYONE. Rather, I am warning everyone what they do to their nails after wearing for just 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
            <li> I TRIED THESE NAILS TODAY AND THEY WERE PRETTY , ITS MY FIRST PRESS ON NAIL I LOVE IT , BE SUPER CAREFUL WHEN WASHING HANDS</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear these, I am complimented on my nail colour</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I bought the white french manicure with flowers and wore them for a week, and everyone thought they were real.  They didn&#x27;t damage my nails, and for the look they give, the amount of time involved (5 minutes for what looks like a salon gel manicure), and the price, its just wonderful.  I don&#x27;t think Im going to get my nails done again for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons:&lt;br /&gt;They only last a week.&lt;br /&gt;They come off if you don&#x27;t stick them on well and let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you have to replace the ones on the fingers you use the most after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, for the money, five stars.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> The nails in the picture look like a light purple, but the real color is a deep, dark burgundy.  The picture is WAY off.  Waste of money - can&#x27;t wear them.</li>
