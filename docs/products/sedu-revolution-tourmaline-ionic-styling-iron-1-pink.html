            <li>Very easy to use and hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of straightening irons and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>Pretty great.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and the heat settings are amazing.</li>
            <li>Even though sedu is supposedly much better</li>
            <li>and I know I could&#x27;ve got more years out of it</li>
            <li>I have always used a chi and sedu is hotter and quicker, it has many settings if desired.</li>
            <li>This is a great brand and works very well</li>
            <li>I love this ionic iron.  </li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE WITH THE SEDU REVOLUTION</li>
            <li>IT IS EVEN BETTER</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I AM DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li>10x better than a CHI.</li>
            <li>It is just okay....</li>
            <li>great quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li>and she says the Fahrenheit&#x27;s and the Chi Air&#x27;s works better for her.</li>
            <li>I will forever buy Sedu revolutions, unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li>I have owned a 1.5 Sedu for many years and decided to switch it up to the 1 inch.</li>
            <li>I love love the sedu</li>
            <li>I love this straightner.  </li>
            <li>Should have gotten many more yrs out of it.</li>
            <li>Croc is waaaaaaaay better...</li>
            <li>I have had this product for several years now and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>i just recently purchased this straightener and im in love with it!!!</li>
            <li>Sedu&#x27;s are the best flat irons I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>one glide through my hair and it is straight and so amazingly SHINY!</li>
            <li>My GF absolutely loves this straightener it made her hair look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely high quality and just spectacular!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the right shape to be effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li>Great quality, better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li>It glides effortlessly, leaving your hair feeling smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>my hair still looked great at the end of the day which has definitely never happened to me before.</li>
            <li>I have recommend this product to several friends, all happy about it.</li>
            <li>Cute color and good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great flat iron to have!</li>
            <li>I had an original CHI straightener forever, and it just broke.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every professional flat iron and this makes my hair the sleekest, with INCREDIBLE SHINE!!</li>
            <li>I used to have another Sedu that I lost back in the summer, so I was familiar with the good quality.  </li>
            <li>It really is a great product and its pink</li>
            <li>Overall, though, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>She said her much cheaper one works better.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and leaves her hair looking very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very straight and fine hair</li>
            <li>This flat iron does a good job in that</li>
            <li>Most flat irons either snagged my hair, or did not give a very smooth finish (I have medium length somewhat wavy hair).</li>
            <li>I have the Sedu Pro 1.5\\&quot; and this one actually gives my hair even more shine and is just as quick!</li>
            <li>So when the new Revolution became available, I was excited to upgrade.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it is so powerful and effective, a larger plate just isnt needed.</li>
            <li>Also worth noting that Sedu will not honor the 2 year warranty that is advertised in the product description because Amazon is not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li>This straightener is absolutely worth them</li>
            <li>Well well well well well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but this one is even better at straighting my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>As all the other Sedu&#x27;s this one is light and glides through my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It can get super hot if need be.</li>
            <li>help you get right to your roots.  </li>
            <li>amazing flat iron!</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my first Sedu (I had the one with the square kind of edges prior - ceramic tourmaline)</li>
            <li>Buy this straightener if you want NO REGRETS. :)</li>
            <li>It is lighter and really straightens quickly given it is a 1&amp;#34; and my Pro was a 1 and 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>She has only had this for about a week or two but had already used it numerous amounts of times and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to quickly do my whole head and it stays straight all day, even with high humidity.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up super fast and stays hot all the way through.</li>
            <li>I will never waste money buying cheap hair products again.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This worked well at first then after about 2 years stopped heating up.  </li>
            <li>It straightens my hair so fast!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast!</li>
            <li>This product worked fairly well for my niece who has long, natural hair.</li>
            <li>let her dial it in right where she wants.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>(I love these flat irons so much that I&#x27;m typing this review from my phone, and it&#x27;s not easy!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works fine for touch ups, but I can&#x27;t even flat iron a whole layer without having to wait for the light to go from red to flashing (heating up to hot).  </li>
            <li>Gets really hot quickly and is great for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>had it not broken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets much hotter than the Chi and the temp controls</li>
            <li>it straightens my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>But I still had to go over each section several times to get the smooth texture I want.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>A cheap Revlon iron can maintain temperature and is a third of the cost.  </li>
            <li>however every time I use it I get lots of compliments that my hair looks very silky and beautify.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair straight and very shiny... found out about from a friend.</li>
            <li>My mother wants one now</li>
            <li>it gets my hair silky straight and stays that way even after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>After several times using this iron, I can say that it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leave my hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid and the amount I use it, it should have lasted me much longer than this.</li>
            <li>I can use this product easily without pulling my hair and it gives a perfectly smooth  appearance and shininess that no other straight on has been able to do on my extremely thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am usually cheap, however, I had heard a friend speak of the Sedu brand, so when my flat iron was dying on me, I decided to bite the bullet &amp; get one for myself.  </li>
            <li>I have the original Sedu flat iron which still works after 6yrs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s currently relaxed and mid down my back, so I have to section it anyway, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets perfectly straight and shiny and I don&#x27;t even need as high of a temperature as I did with my old cheap flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and lately started straightening them, after much research got this one and loving it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>a little more probably bc of the heat.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve had so many different flat irons that have not done ANYTHING to my hair!</li>
            <li>All in all if you have very straight hair and are looking for something to give you curls that last all day and won&#x27;t do too much damage</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that there is much damage as there was with my old irons.</li>
            <li>I asked my hairdresser if he could recommend me a new one, and he told me this one.</li>
            <li>The straightener was listed as new.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, WOW!</li>
            <li>Just transitioned from relaxed to natural!)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it is just as good, with a few additonal perks.  </li>
            <li>The previous version was light weight.  </li>
            <li>heats up super fast and gets the job done in half the time !</li>
            <li>this is wayyy better than the chi flat iron that always broke down after some time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many flat irons, from cheap to less cheap, to expensive.</li>
            <li>Ordered this iron (Sold by Divinebeauty, fulfilled by Amazon) and it clearly is used/refurbished.</li>
            <li>So I went on my honeymoon to Italy and the electric converter thing completely blew the life out of my Chi.</li>
            <li>For me and my shorter (but not short) hair, I do not see any real difference between this and my cheaper Conair iron.</li>
            <li>I have natural curl in my hair and owned an instyler.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy hair, and when the flat iron was working properly, it was great.  </li>
            <li>works very well and havent seen much damage on my hair after using it for 2 month every other day.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I generally blow dry with a round brush to get most of the curl out, then flat iron in layers to get it straight and eliminate frizz.  </li>
            <li>As an African American woman with natural hair, at times I like to wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a pretty pink.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and dry, but it looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li>So of course when I saw this one thought it would be better, definitely not the case, made very poorly and didn&#x27;t even use it often to get my money worth.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair (at least shoulder length), it will probably work better.</li>
            <li>With this iron, I can get silky straight hair with minimal damage.  </li>
            <li>The down on this is returning the first one will take the company 30 days to refund my money after they recieve it ..</li>
            <li>I have very kinky/curly dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair yet is strong enough for my sisters thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a flat iron for professional use?  </li>
            <li>(I am African American with natural 3b hair.</li>
            <li>Really straightens your hair down.</li>
            <li>It also cuts the straightening time almost in half because it takes fewer moves to get a section straight.</li>

            <li> My GF absolutely loves this straightener it made her hair look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely high quality and just spectacular!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the right shape to be effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li> Great quality, better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li> It glides effortlessly, leaving your hair feeling smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> my hair still looked great at the end of the day which has definitely never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> I have recommend this product to several friends, all happy about it.</li>
            <li> Cute color and good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great flat iron to have!</li>
            <li> I had an original CHI straightener forever, and it just broke.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every professional flat iron and this makes my hair the sleekest, with INCREDIBLE SHINE!!</li>
            <li> I used to have another Sedu that I lost back in the summer, so I was familiar with the good quality.  </li>
            <li> It really is a great product and its pink</li>
            <li> Overall, though, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> She said her much cheaper one works better.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and leaves her hair looking very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very straight and fine hair</li>
            <li> This flat iron does a good job in that</li>
            <li> Most flat irons either snagged my hair, or did not give a very smooth finish (I have medium length somewhat wavy hair).</li>
            <li> I have the Sedu Pro 1.5\\&quot; and this one actually gives my hair even more shine and is just as quick!</li>
            <li> So when the new Revolution became available, I was excited to upgrade.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it is so powerful and effective, a larger plate just isnt needed.</li>
            <li> Also worth noting that Sedu will not honor the 2 year warranty that is advertised in the product description because Amazon is not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> This straightener is absolutely worth them</li>
            <li> Well well well well well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but this one is even better at straighting my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> As all the other Sedu&#x27;s this one is light and glides through my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> It can get super hot if need be.</li>
            <li> help you get right to your roots.  </li>
            <li> amazing flat iron!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my first Sedu (I had the one with the square kind of edges prior - ceramic tourmaline)</li>
            <li> Buy this straightener if you want NO REGRETS. :)</li>
            <li> It is lighter and really straightens quickly given it is a 1&amp;#34; and my Pro was a 1 and 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> She has only had this for about a week or two but had already used it numerous amounts of times and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to quickly do my whole head and it stays straight all day, even with high humidity.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up super fast and stays hot all the way through.</li>
            <li> I will never waste money buying cheap hair products again.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This worked well at first then after about 2 years stopped heating up.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair so fast!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast!</li>
            <li> This product worked fairly well for my niece who has long, natural hair.</li>
            <li> let her dial it in right where she wants.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> (I love these flat irons so much that I&#x27;m typing this review from my phone, and it&#x27;s not easy!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works fine for touch ups, but I can&#x27;t even flat iron a whole layer without having to wait for the light to go from red to flashing (heating up to hot).  </li>
            <li> Gets really hot quickly and is great for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> had it not broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets much hotter than the Chi and the temp controls</li>
            <li> it straightens my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> But I still had to go over each section several times to get the smooth texture I want.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> A cheap Revlon iron can maintain temperature and is a third of the cost.  </li>
            <li> however every time I use it I get lots of compliments that my hair looks very silky and beautify.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair straight and very shiny... found out about from a friend.</li>
            <li> My mother wants one now</li>
            <li> it gets my hair silky straight and stays that way even after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> After several times using this iron, I can say that it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid and the amount I use it, it should have lasted me much longer than this.</li>
            <li> I can use this product easily without pulling my hair and it gives a perfectly smooth  appearance and shininess that no other straight on has been able to do on my extremely thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am usually cheap, however, I had heard a friend speak of the Sedu brand, so when my flat iron was dying on me, I decided to bite the bullet &amp; get one for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have the original Sedu flat iron which still works after 6yrs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s currently relaxed and mid down my back, so I have to section it anyway, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets perfectly straight and shiny and I don&#x27;t even need as high of a temperature as I did with my old cheap flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and lately started straightening them, after much research got this one and loving it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> a little more probably bc of the heat.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had so many different flat irons that have not done ANYTHING to my hair!</li>
            <li> All in all if you have very straight hair and are looking for something to give you curls that last all day and won&#x27;t do too much damage</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that there is much damage as there was with my old irons.</li>
            <li> I asked my hairdresser if he could recommend me a new one, and he told me this one.</li>
            <li> The straightener was listed as new.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, WOW!</li>
            <li> Just transitioned from relaxed to natural!)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it is just as good, with a few additonal perks.  </li>
            <li> The previous version was light weight.  </li>
            <li> heats up super fast and gets the job done in half the time !</li>
            <li> this is wayyy better than the chi flat iron that always broke down after some time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many flat irons, from cheap to less cheap, to expensive.</li>
            <li> Ordered this iron (Sold by Divinebeauty, fulfilled by Amazon) and it clearly is used/refurbished.</li>
            <li> So I went on my honeymoon to Italy and the electric converter thing completely blew the life out of my Chi.</li>
            <li> For me and my shorter (but not short) hair, I do not see any real difference between this and my cheaper Conair iron.</li>
            <li> I have natural curl in my hair and owned an instyler.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, and when the flat iron was working properly, it was great.  </li>
            <li> works very well and havent seen much damage on my hair after using it for 2 month every other day.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I generally blow dry with a round brush to get most of the curl out, then flat iron in layers to get it straight and eliminate frizz.  </li>
            <li> As an African American woman with natural hair, at times I like to wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and dry, but it looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li> So of course when I saw this one thought it would be better, definitely not the case, made very poorly and didn&#x27;t even use it often to get my money worth.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair (at least shoulder length), it will probably work better.</li>
            <li> With this iron, I can get silky straight hair with minimal damage.  </li>
            <li> The down on this is returning the first one will take the company 30 days to refund my money after they recieve it ..</li>
            <li> I have very kinky/curly dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair yet is strong enough for my sisters thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a flat iron for professional use?  </li>
            <li> (I am African American with natural 3b hair.</li>
            <li> Really straightens your hair down.</li>
            <li> It also cuts the straightening time almost in half because it takes fewer moves to get a section straight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron since 2005.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with how my hair is with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron doesn&#x27;t maintain temperature.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it damages my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend my old Sedu, but unless you have thin, already fairly straight hair or a lot of time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and straightened my hair perfectly in less than five minutes!!</li>
            <li> Definitively doesn&#x27;t snag on hair when gliding through, and results are very long lasting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret a single cent spent on this.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, however, I expected that the time needed to get the job done with this flat iron would be shorter than with my previous flat irons; and I am not finding that to be the case.</li>
            <li> I will say the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this iron is that is is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have extra money to waste.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to buy this iron,because they all claim that your hair will not get dry or burned.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m not sure it works better than my previous, less expensive iron.</li>
            <li> But still, it should not be broken after such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been difficult trying to find an iron that can leave my hair shiny,smooth and straight from root to end.</li>
            <li> I tried the hottest temp but no success.</li>
            <li> With the Revolution, you can create soft curls and thin plates</li>
            <li> It works wonders for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> i have a layered bob hair cut and my hair is thick and coarse and it takes me less than 15mins to do my hair..</li>
            <li> This causes me to think it was used and returned by a previous customer.</li>
            <li> You can style your hair with little time.</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair but still would look fluffy.</li>
            <li> Only disappointment was that the pink iron did not come with the heat proof case as is pictured.</li>
            <li> I thought the 1 \\&quot; plate might be a bit small</li>
            <li> Sorry I recommended this to friends, they have had the same problems.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was a bit concerned about the buttons being on the inside of the straightener, but that hasn&#x27;t been a big deal.</li>
            <li> Sadly my baby broke it the other day and now it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and kinky.  </li>
            <li> and i will never own anything else!!</li>
            <li> so I thought I knew what I was getting - expensive, but quality.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of the product.  </li>

            <li> I have very straight and fine hair and I use this to curl my hair. I got mine about 2 years ago from another site and love it! It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair when I use it like when I used metal curling irons and the curls last all day unlike regular curling irons. Sadly my baby broke it the other day and now it doesn&#x27;t work, no it wasn&#x27;t on. I have also used the herstyler onyx but i broke that one and got this one. Even though sedu is supposedly much better I found both to be just about equally good. The curls lasted a lot longer with the herstyler but I felt it damaged it a little more probably bc of the heat. Also you can&#x27;t adjust the heat on the herstyler whereas on the sedu you can. All in all if you have very straight hair and are looking for something to give you curls that last all day and won&#x27;t do too much damage I recommend this sedu iron. It will last you.  I was on two years and I know I could&#x27;ve got more years out of it had it not broken. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I did not realize that I needed to pay attention to the plug details of this product.I discovered immediately that this tool required a 220 outlet, so I returned it.I reordered another one paying attention to alllll details.Sedu is awesome .I love this flat iron.I have always used a chi and sedu is hotter and quicker, it has many settings if desired. It also comes in a pretty pink. The down on this is returning the first one will take the company 30 days to refund my money after they recieve it ..Go figure</li>
            <li> This is well worth every penny.  I am usually cheap, however, I had heard a friend speak of the Sedu brand, so when my flat iron was dying on me, I decided to bite the bullet &amp; get one for myself.  All I can say is, WOW! I will never waste money buying cheap hair products again.  It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for!  It never pulls your hair.  It glides effortlessly, leaving your hair feeling smooth &amp; silky. It also cuts the straightening time almost in half because it takes fewer moves to get a section straight. The ion factor also reduces split ends!  All in all, this is a great flat iron to have!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I am trying a styling iron and I am very happy with this purchase.  It heats up very quickly and leaves your hair flawless.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  It makes your hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> amazing flat iron! heats up super fast and gets the job done in half the time !</li>
            <li> This flat iron does a good job in that once my hair is straightened, it stays that way all day. I have very thick, wavy hair and it&#x27;s a struggle to get it to straighten and stay that way. Based on the other reviews, however, I expected that the time needed to get the job done with this flat iron would be shorter than with my previous flat irons; and I am not finding that to be the case. Hence the four stars, instead of five. Overall, though, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It was good for a while but stopped working..This is a great brand and works very well but I think this is a defective piece.</li>
            <li> I bought this,&#x27;because my girlfriend wanted it because it was awarded best straightener. But she didn&#x27;t like it at all. She said her much cheaper one works better. Not so happy about this product.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman with natural hair, at times I like to wear my hair straight.  With this iron, I can get silky straight hair with minimal damage.  I have owned a Sedu before, and I loved it.  So when the new Revolution became available, I was excited to upgrade.  I will say the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this iron is that is is a bit heavy.  The previous version was light weight.  But other than that, it is just as good, with a few additonal perks.  With the Revolution, you can create soft curls and thin plates help you get right to your roots.  I have also onwed a Chi, and I must say Sedu out peforms.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife. after reading tons of reviews and going back and forth between this and another Chi I went with this. My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets much hotter than the Chi and the temp controls let her dial it in right where she wants. She says its the best straightener she&#x27;s owned.</li>
            <li> The iron works great to smooth and straighten my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. It does add shine and is very smoothing,making her hair look great! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m not sure it works better than my previous, less expensive iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s light weight, so it&#x27;s perfect for my carpal tunnel.  It does a great job heating up within minutes.  Only 1inch plat, but it straightens my hair really well.  My hair is very thick and kinky.  It&#x27;s currently relaxed and mid down my back, so I have to section it anyway, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  So I guess, straightening time was reduced a bit. But I still had to go over each section several times to get the smooth texture I want.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great straightner. Takes about 30 min to get it perfect. Lasts about three house though and then bottom of hair / tips become wavy again. Really straightens your hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this ionic iron.  You can style your hair with little time. I wish I had bought the case though.</li>
            <li> they work great - I&#x27;ve dropped them a couple times and they still work great.  Just wish they made a crack proof one!</li>
            <li> Glides like silk through my hair, no snaging or pulling at all and even at a low temp. one glide through my hair and it is straight and so amazingly SHINY! I thought the 1 \\&quot; plate might be a bit small but it is so powerful and effective, a larger plate just isnt needed. I have the Sedu Pro 1.5\\&quot; and this one actually gives my hair even more shine and is just as quick! I am IN LOVE WITH THE SEDU REVOLUTION IT IS EVEN BETTER THEN THE SEDU PRO!! I have tried just about every professional flat iron and this makes my hair the sleekest, with INCREDIBLE SHINE!!</li>
            <li> Best  love it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Ordered this iron (Sold by Divinebeauty, fulfilled by Amazon) and it clearly is used/refurbished. There is residue on the plates that I recognize as build up from styling products, and dirt in the grooves and crevices. The box is scuffed up on the inside as well. Very disappointing. Also worth noting that Sedu will not honor the 2 year warranty that is advertised in the product description because Amazon is not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> This worked well at first then after about 2 years stopped heating up.  I have the original Sedu flat iron which still works after 6yrs and I love it.  So of course when I saw this one thought it would be better, definitely not the case, made very poorly and didn&#x27;t even use it often to get my money worth.  Sorry I recommended this to friends, they have had the same problems.</li>
            <li> So I went on my honeymoon to Italy and the electric converter thing completely blew the life out of my Chi. BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED!!! This straightener is absolutely worth them money. I am such a cheapo but I splurged on this one and it was a great choice! Buy this straightener if you want NO REGRETS. :)</li>
            <li> I had an original CHI straightener forever, and it just broke. I asked my hairdresser if he could recommend me a new one, and he told me this one. I AM DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! 10x better than a CHI. I have fine hair, and the heat settings are amazing. It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair yet is strong enough for my sisters thick curly hair. Well well well well well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is just okay....it doesn&#x27;t have the right shape to be effective.</li>
            <li> i just recently purchased this straightener and im in love with it!!! I owned a CHI before this Sedu and i will never own anything else!! this one is amazing..i have a layered bob hair cut and my hair is thick and coarse and it takes me less than 15mins to do my hair..it leaves my hair shiny and smooth!! i never have that frizzy look and it does not pull my hair out like my CHI did!! love this item!! I recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Sedu&#x27;s are the best flat irons I have ever used.  Only disappointment was that the pink iron did not come with the heat proof case as is pictured.</li>
            <li> great quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron since 2005. I have had 3 and they have all been amazing! I can use this product easily without pulling my hair and it gives a perfectly smooth  appearance and shininess that no other straight on has been able to do on my extremely thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> (I love these flat irons so much that I&#x27;m typing this review from my phone, and it&#x27;s not easy!)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have extra money to waste. I will spend money for my hair appliances though. So, I&#x27;ve had so many different flat irons that have not done ANYTHING to my hair! (I am African American with natural 3b hair. Just transitioned from relaxed to natural!) I have tried the regular Sedu Ionic Ceramic Pro (returned them!), Chi, Fhi, Fahrenheit, Cortex, Chi Air, and etc. Couple of irons did a good job, but Groupon had a deal on Sedu. I&#x27;ve been on Folica.com and saw the price. When I saw the Groupon deal, I HAD to try the Sedu Revolution! The best decision EVER! It works wonders for thick, coarse hair. My sister has semi-fine hair and she says the Fahrenheit&#x27;s and the Chi Air&#x27;s works better for her. I will forever buy Sedu revolutions, unless something better comes along. I may try the 1.5 inch! Just ordered the Sedu Revolution Dryer 4000i. I will review it when it comes!</li>
            <li> works very well and havent seen much damage on my hair after using it for 2 month every other day. gets compliment on the curves it creates quite a lot!</li>
            <li> This product worked fairly well for my niece who has long, natural hair. I have relaxed medium hair and was looking for this to be somewhat of an in-between straightener to minimize how often I relaxed my hair. For this purpose, it is not that great. If you have long hair (at least shoulder length), it will probably work better. For me and my shorter (but not short) hair, I do not see any real difference between this and my cheaper Conair iron. For African-American women, you may want to purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky/curly dry coarse hair. It&#x27;s been difficult trying to find an iron that can leave my hair shiny,smooth and straight from root to end. This Sedu iron does just that. I only have to pass the iron through each section twice! (Total time saver!) The iron heats up super fast and stays hot all the way through. Great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with how my hair is with this flat iron. My hair gets perfectly straight and shiny and I don&#x27;t even need as high of a temperature as I did with my old cheap flat iron. My hair remains that way until I wash it again. Even spending all day outside in humid weather (hello Disney world) my hair still looked great at the end of the day which has definitely never happened to me before. I don&#x27;t regret a single cent spent on this.</li>
            <li> Greatest straightener ever !!!!</li>
            <li> My GF absolutely loves this straightener it made her hair look AMAZING! If you are having any doubts about purchasing this you shouldn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s extremely high quality and just spectacular!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  This wasn&#x27;t my first Sedu (I had the one with the square kind of edges prior - ceramic tourmaline) so I thought I knew what I was getting - expensive, but quality.  I have naturally curly hair that I generally blow dry with a round brush to get most of the curl out, then flat iron in layers to get it straight and eliminate frizz.  This flat iron doesn&#x27;t maintain temperature.  It works fine for touch ups, but I can&#x27;t even flat iron a whole layer without having to wait for the light to go from red to flashing (heating up to hot).  A cheap Revlon iron can maintain temperature and is a third of the cost.  I would definitely recommend my old Sedu, but unless you have thin, already fairly straight hair or a lot of time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many flat irons, from cheap to less cheap, to expensive. Most flat irons either snagged my hair, or did not give a very smooth finish (I have medium length somewhat wavy hair). I absolutely love this flat iron. The width is perfect, it heats up fast, it does NOT snag my hair, and it pairs so well with my hair products. I would definitely recommend this to others, and have. I can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about this iron.</li>
            <li> The straightener was listed as new. It came in a damaged box and the wrapping was not neat. This causes me to think it was used and returned by a previous customer. After using it, the temperature was faulty. It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair. I tried the hottest temp but no success. I ended up burning and ruining my hair using this product.</li>
            <li> Cute color and good quality flat iron. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it damages my hair. however every time I use it I get lots of compliments that my hair looks very silky and beautify.</li>
            <li> Great iron! Makes my hair straight and very shiny... found out about from a friend. My mother wants one now</li>
            <li> I have owned a 1.5 Sedu for many years and decided to switch it up to the 1 inch. Needless to say, I was a bit concerned about the buttons being on the inside of the straightener, but that hasn&#x27;t been a big deal. As all the other Sedu&#x27;s this one is light and glides through my hair nicely. If it had an auto-off feature, I would give this a 6 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have natural curl in my hair and owned an instyler. It straightened my hair but still would look fluffy. I love love the sedu it gets my hair silky straight and stays that way even after sleeping on it. It&#x27;s awesome well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner.  It can get super hot if need be. I don&#x27;t feel that there is much damage as there was with my old irons.</li>
            <li> Had this for about a year and a 1/2. Then one plate went out. Would have chucked it up as a loss and moved on if it didn&#x27;t cost me $260. Should have gotten many more yrs out of it.</li>
            <li> I owned the Sedu Pro before this one. I loved the Pro but this one is even better at straighting my natural curly hair.It is lighter and really straightens quickly given it is a 1&amp;#34; and my Pro was a 1 and 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i love this straightener! I got it for christmas and it couldve been better! It comes in a nice package and the straightener itself is aesthetically pleasing.  Heats up really fast and straightened my hair perfectly in less than five minutes!!</li>
            <li> Croc is waaaaaaaay better... This one doesn&#x27;t straighten as good</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and lately started straightening them, after much research got this one and loving it. Very easy to use and hair looks really nice.</li>
            <li> this is wayyy better than the chi flat iron that always broke down after some time</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair so fast! Heats up fast! I&#x27;m in love! Great quality, better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several years now and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend it.  I bought my daughter her own as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty great. Adjustable temperature is a great feature. Definitively doesn&#x27;t snag on hair when gliding through, and results are very long lasting</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to buy this iron,because they all claim that your hair will not get dry or burned. After several times using this iron, I can say that it is fantastic. It leave my hair straight and shinny. My hair is very thin and dry, but it looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shinny - I love this product.  I used to have another Sedu that I lost back in the summer, so I was familiar with the good quality.  I have recommend this product to several friends, all happy about it.</li>
            <li> Had this iron for over 3 years. Gets really hot quickly and is great for thick and long hair. Would definately buy another one of this or a Paul Mitchell iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of straightening irons and this is the best one by far. I&#x27;m able to quickly do my whole head and it stays straight all day, even with high humidity.</li>
            <li> This product did not even last me one year.  After about ten months, it stopped heating up to its maximum capacity, and then this morning, about 11 months after purchasing it, it stopped heating up all together.  I haven&#x27;t tried dealing with the manufacturer yet, as I have to dig out the box, which I hope I still have.  But still, it should not be broken after such a short period of time.  This is supposed to be a flat iron for professional use?  I don&#x27;t even use it every day.  I have very thick, wavy hair, and when the flat iron was working properly, it was great.  But I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of the product.  For the price I paid and the amount I use it, it should have lasted me much longer than this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. It heats up very quickly and leaves her hair looking very shiny and smooth. It really is a great product and its pink so she loves it. She has only had this for about a week or two but had already used it numerous amounts of times and it works great.</li>
