            <li> Would like the bottle to have had a spray or at least a smaller cap over to assist in application  of cologne use or waste from spilling when applying cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a barbershop, spicy and a little powdery scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers with negative comments are talking about.  </li>
            <li> JUST GOT THIS CRAP IN THE MAIL</li>
            <li> WILL NOT ORDER $30.00 OF THIS CRAP</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> And excellent purchase. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of this product!  Good price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers with negative comments are talking about.  This is EXACTLY what I used to buy 10 years ago. I spent $50 on a bottle half the size I got this time and only paid one quarter the price.  This stuff lasts and lasts on you and you only need to use a couple of dabs from your fingertip.  There isn&#x27;t a sprayer with this bottle.  That&#x27;s completely fine for me. I tell you what, if this stuff is a knockoff, it&#x27;s a d**m good one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He will be wearing it all the time from now on. Lasts fairly well all day, especially on clothes.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  Good product and great price!</li>
            <li> Advertised as a spray but IT IS NOT a spray. I ended up having to dump it in an old empty spray bottle, didn&#x27;t think I would have to provide my own spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I Love wearing PAUL SEBASTIAN cologne by Paul Sebastian ,it smells great and the women love it.&lt;br /&gt;As a well groom man in my profession as a accountant with a lot female clients earning over $100,000 plus/ age 50+ they speak there mind.&lt;br /&gt;It also make me feel good with this type of attention and being a professional that know his business well.&lt;br /&gt;They talk:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You say that you are happy with your wife and family\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You look and smell good, make a great living faithful to your wife\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;Try a bottle or two.</li>
            <li> The prices fluctuate a lot.Many drug stores sell in online,free shipping and much cheaper.I like the scent and will be wearing it more.This ISN&#x27;T a spray,even though it&#x27;s sold as one.</li>
            <li> I bought some as a gift for Fathers Day and I bought some for myself. Good value for the 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> More of the best off work smell and my woman likes it. just makes sense to order the 8 oz to refill the sprayer than purchasing it in smaller volumes. I use this stuff almost daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a christmas gift, and I know that he will love it  will be back for more</li>
            <li> Would like the bottle to have had a spray or at least a smaller cap over to assist in application  of cologne use or waste from spilling when applying cologne. Otherwise this was a bargain.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to install, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product as advertised..</li>
            <li> I have worn PS since it came out .  It reminds me of a high end old spice. It is amazing.  Has a barbershop, spicy and a little powdery scent. It lasts a long time. And as always, you only need a dab or two. The dry down is oriental heaven.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband smells delicious! And he gets many compliments!</li>
            <li> I had asked for this for several occasion for a year. It came across my screen so I ordered it myself. Unbeknown to me my wife had just ordered the same thing for me for Christmas, wrapped and under the tree. I think I have plenty!!!</li>
            <li> My second order from this supplier and very satisfied both times, with the service especially.</li>

            <li> My husband has used this product for many many years and just loves it. So do I. But it was not as strong this time.</li>

            <li> everything was fine.  the only problem was that I was told that my order was a spray bottle of the fragrance and it was not.&lt;br /&gt;That is the only problem I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>

            <li> I am a female, and a very feminine one, but I love this men&#x27;s fragrance and wear it during the day.  my husband prefers that I wear Paloma Picasso when we go out in the evening which is all the time, but the fragrances mix together well.</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne that I have ever had in a big 8.0 ounce at that just love it I had to get one more keep it coming yessssssss!!!</li>

            <li> wonderful product at a very reasonable price! Nice scent for a man, yet not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas and got it fast.  It smells great.  It was a big bottle and for the price I wold buy another.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like brut or musk. Not my style, it smells like my great uncle earle after he shaves.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells wonderful and the price is much better than you can find it in any department stores.  My husband loves it!</li>
