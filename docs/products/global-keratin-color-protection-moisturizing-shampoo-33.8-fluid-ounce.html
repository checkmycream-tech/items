            <li>Quick service, excellent hair care product.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I have color &amp; keratin-treated hair and its the only kind that keeps my hair in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>my hair is perfect no dry anymore</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this shampoo and love the results.</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo and super fast delivery</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THE ITEM EARLY, GREAT JOB</li>
            <li>Have used many Sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>Love this product it goes hand in hand with the GK moisturizing conditioner and it keeps the hair clean and your karitain treatment lots longer</li>
            <li>In my case it&#x27;s that my relatively fine blond hair is thinning like nature intended.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it works for her.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo, it&#x27;s very gentle but cleans well.</li>
            <li>I appreciated them taping the top of the bottle for shipping - prevented leaking.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I need as a low maintenance, busy business owner that wants to naturally look great!</li>
            <li>First of all the pump in it does not work-- seems like it may have been a reject unit that was sold through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I get Keratin treatments, so this is the only brand that I am able to use.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says - keeps my hair straight even in the Atlanta humidity!</li>
            <li>She is very pleased, as I am because of the lower expense, and although it won&#x27;t keep my hair from changing from natural blond to shock white, I like it too.  </li>
            <li>and you do not need too much to get the soppy feeling and the lather.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really makes a difference in the way my hair looks, smells and feels.</li>
            <li>In my wife&#x27;s case it seems that her hair is determined to go gray, much to her consternation.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was great in assisting with the return of the wrong merchandise.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft, manageable, and extra shiny.</li>
            <li>I ordered a large bottle of shampoo, along with regular size bottles of shampoo and conditioner, but I received conditioner instead of shampoo.</li>
            <li>So she visits the hair salon for coloring once a month and then pays rather hefty fees for some of their products that are supposed to help her keep the hair color looking natural.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that will get my hair clean without leaving it feeling brittle and stripped.</li>

            <li> Great Product and value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great quality for an awesome price! I have color &amp; keratin-treated hair and its the only kind that keeps my hair in excellent condition. I&#x27;ve tried it all and I can&#x27;t use any other shampoo &amp; conditioner! Makes my hair super soft, manageable, and extra shiny. I don&#x27;t need detangler with this amazing conditioner! Its exactly what I need as a low maintenance, busy business owner that wants to naturally look great! A must try!</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THE ITEM EARLY, GREAT JOB</li>
            <li> Have used many Sulfate free shampoos. This is my favorite.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I get Keratin treatments, so this is the only brand that I am able to use. I found Amazon&#x27;s price to be lower than my salon&#x27;s price for this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I appreciated them taping the top of the bottle for shipping - prevented leaking.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist introduced me to this shampoo about a year ago.  When I saw I could get it via Amazon, in a larger pump bottle for not much more than what I paid for half the amount at the salon, I knew I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I&#x27;m set for a while.  This shampoo really makes a difference in the way my hair looks, smells and feels.</li>
            <li> great product, timely manner</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says - keeps my hair straight even in the Atlanta humidity!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this shampoo and love the results.</li>
            <li> Works great hair is softer. Received timely from co</li>
            <li> If you have your hair treated with Keratin...this is the best shampoo on the market. My hair is not damaged from the Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> This is the last bottle of shampoo you&#x27;ll every buy! Well, probably not, but this bottle is *damn* big so it will be around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo, it&#x27;s very gentle but cleans well. I live in a very dry climate and it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that will get my hair clean without leaving it feeling brittle and stripped. Pleasant scent, and it does come with a pump. Very happy with the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work so really disappointed as product now has to be poured which is hard in such a large, heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I ordered a large bottle of shampoo, along with regular size bottles of shampoo and conditioner, but I received conditioner instead of shampoo. Therefore the 33.8 oz bottle was returned. Amazon was great in assisting with the return of the wrong merchandise. I am just waiting for my purchase to be credited which should be reflected on my next credit card statement. I reviewed Global Keratin products on another posting.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I are at that age where our bodies -- including our hair -- seem to want to surprise us with various changes. In my case it&#x27;s that my relatively fine blond hair is thinning like nature intended.  In my wife&#x27;s case it seems that her hair is determined to go gray, much to her consternation.  So she visits the hair salon for coloring once a month and then pays rather hefty fees for some of their products that are supposed to help her keep the hair color looking natural.  I hate it when an expensive product doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I hate it even more when it appears to accelerate the color change instead of preserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a shot on this Keratin Color Protection Moisturizing Shampoo and paid half of what she gets charged at her hair salon.  Fortunately it works for her.  She is very pleased, as I am because of the lower expense, and although it won&#x27;t keep my hair from changing from natural blond to shock white, I like it too.  I just wish that it would prevent my hair from falling out.  Now that would be a great product!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Received quickly.</li>
