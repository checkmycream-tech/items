            <li>An eyelet for hanging would be a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Remington also makes nice hair dryers and curling irons as well, all well priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice nice design;</li>
            <li>However, with some practice, it produces really nice results.</li>
            <li>I mostly liked it.</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>No waiting around, like forever. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Would make a Fantastic Gift!  </li>

            <li>Would make a Fantastic Gift!  </li>
            <li>I think it could be better, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be in this price range.</li>
            <li>It also heats up really fast, which is great when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>And at this price point, you sure get a lot.</li>
            <li>but if it had floating plates, it would be a bit more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Longer plates than most straighteners</li>
            <li>It was a bit more brittle than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair:  </li>
            <li>This hair straightener does a good job straightening and shaping hair and it can be used on damp hair right out of the bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But at this price I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and straightens well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The straightener does heat up very quickly, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates glide easily over my hair, with no pulling.</li>
            <li>unit is of a sturdy plastic with smooth Ceramic plates - Remington&#x27;s design allows this performance tool to heat up in just 30 seconds, and it does just that.</li>
            <li>the Remington Wet2Straight Straightener, 1 Inch, sound like what you may be looking for?</li>
            <li>the Remington Wet2Straight Straightener, 1 Inch, sound like what you may be looking for?</li>
            <li>It delivers cheap results.</li>
            <li>The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control</li>
            <li>On the hottest setting, it did straighten my hair nicely, but it wasn&#x27;t the silky straight</li>
            <li>But, my hair looks fine, it&#x27;s not any more damaged using this than using the hair dryer first.  </li>
            <li>So for this price point, this flat iron is a great choice.</li>
            <li>Use and Care Guide (in English) is easy to follow -- graphics are good sized, clear and bright.</li>
            <li>Eiermann, 2014Guide (in English) is easy to follow -- graphics are good sized, clear and bright.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot very quickly.</li>
            <li>My set lasted 3 days without losing any of it&#x27;s original freshness.</li>
            <li>My set lasted 3 days without losing any of it&#x27;s original freshness.</li>
            <li>That makes the Wet to Straight straightener the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great on dry hair and really great on wet hair!</li>
            <li>its self was not bad, because it worked great on dry hair, I just don&#x27;t think it works great on wet hair at all!</li>
            <li>I had the bigger one before and loved it and got this one</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and have used a hair straightener for years to smooth my hair and give volume without kinks from curling iron.</li>
            <li>A vent channel -- which releases moisture as steam -- runs along the underside and top of the top ceramic plate, 2 rows, 5 vents each for a total of 10 steam vents.</li>
            <li>It quickly dries hair while straightening, which is convenient.  </li>
            <li>it really did provide nice straightening results without too much frizz.</li>
            <li>I’m always looking for ways to speed up my morning grooming routine, so I was very interested in trying the Remington Products</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and has a natural curl to it.</li>
            <li>I am not so sure is a good idea for me personally due to too much damage</li>
            <li>/&gt;The directions are not that easy to find and they don’t say much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for fine straight hair</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely not the most manageable, it&#x27;s fairly fine</li>
            <li>This makes it smooth, silky and straight.</li>
            <li>The Teflon coating is effective at preventing sticking and overall</li>
            <li>It would be better to have the temperature marked in degrees</li>
            <li>the only thing is that since I&#x27;m straightening my own hair, the steam could be coming out the sides too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>just the right size.</li>
            <li>Remington S-7211 is less effective for a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li>Flat Iron, itself, feels sturdy, light weight and is easy to hold in hand.</li>
            <li>very, very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles,</li>
            <li>very, very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles,</li>
            <li>The top and bottom are very responsive when pressed together and quickly spring open when pressure is released.</li>
            <li>Hot water from the steam spits out onto your hand/wrist.</li>
            <li>It makes hair very frizzy!</li>
            <li>I found that it did indeed allow me to effectively style my wet, but towel dampened hair.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily my all-time favorite straightener,</li>
            <li>but I have a lot of it, which tends to be a challenge in a lot of styling situations, so someone will less problematic hair might have more luck but for me, this one is just a bit too cheap to work well on mine.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and the straightener took forever to dry it.</li>
            <li>This wet to straight technology is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron certainly works a lot better than the Remington</li>
            <li>Remington S7211 is a simple, straightforward product that is very reasonably priced and gets the job done without very much fuss to speak of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had a few Remington flat irons, and this is probably the best one of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly</li>
            <li>When the green light is steadily lit, the iron is fully heated and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several heating settings, which are selected by turning the nob located on the inside of the iron (very easy to get to, the nob is away from the heated part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>one has a temp control feature which is very nice due to everyone having different needs based on their hair texture and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is easy enough to determine the correct settings by trial and error.  </li>
            <li>My experience with this straightener is ok when I have used it on my dry</li>
            <li>Combed through hair with large tooth comb, sectioned hair with butterfly clips (or whatever you use) --</li>
            <li>Combed through hair with large tooth comb, sectioned hair with butterfly clips (or whatever you use) --</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work better with wet hair if you have shorter hair, but I really can’t say.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li>I think it is so convenient to be able to use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li>turning it on, the indicator light is yellow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my hair looking shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this straightener.</li>
            <li>My hair is actually fairly straight, but I have parts that look dry/flyaway.</li>
            <li>I really like that this has an adjustable heat control dial.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast (in less than a minute) and has a more than ample heat range up to 420 degrees.</li>
            <li>And if I don&#x27;t wash it, my hair stays straight for a couple days, only needs a quick touch up here and there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thirty second heat up: I am astonished at how quickly this straightener went straight to the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>It is lacking the capacity to process fine hair without leaving them feeling damaged, dry, and brittle.    </li>
            <li>2 Straight 1-inch is easy to use and does a decent job on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have a few that give me better results, but they also cost six times as much as this one.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly over your hair and straightens within the first few swipes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found with flat irons that you really get what you pay for, and this is a cheap flat iron.  </li>
            <li>They seem to really work, the hot steam really comes off when straightening from wet hair...</li>
            <li>likes that this helps her hair dry out in a nice quiet manner and at the same time straighten her hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get a scorched feeling to my hair, just frizzier than normal and didn&#x27;t lay quite as flat and straight as it otherwise would.</li>
            <li>I used this Wet to Straight Straightener with mixed results - yes, it worked to steam my hair dry, which was a nice alternative to blowing it out.  </li>
            <li>: I used a couple of heat proof gloves made especially for handling hot irons, as the steam from the vents does get</li>
            <li>: I used a couple of heat proof gloves made especially for handling hot irons, as the steam from the vents does get</li>
            <li>It works OK, but I have to say with as much hair as I have, it really takes a long time to use this flat iron on wet hair.</li>
            <li>If you start with damp hair (not dripping wet) it is actually pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I found it ended up taking more time trying to use this on wet hair than it does just to blow dry it and then style my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for regular, normal use, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has fixed ceramic plates that heat up fast and the upper ones are vented to release steam when used on damp</li>
            <li>Now I have to be clear</li>
            <li>Have tried it 3 times &amp; had to get out my OLD straightener to re-do my hair, which is shoulder length hair.</li>

            <li>to adjust the temperature marked from L to 30 in increments of 5 are inside.  </li>
            <li>However, it requires several more passes than more expensive T3&#x27;s, such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it made it very frizzy and it actually started to smell burnt</li>
            <li>While using it on dry hair, it didn&#x27;t perform as well as my current hair straightener that is a bit higher end and works really well.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 quick passes (working from near crown and out/down) per section to completely dry My hair, a total of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 quick passes (working from near crown and out/down) per section to completely dry My hair, a total of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It eliminates a step of needing to blow dry your hair first.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, and it is halfway down my back, so it takes a while to style it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re my go to brand for hair dryers, since they are powerful, inexpensive and last a long time.</li>
            <li>construction is solid, but the overall weight is only 10.7 oz., which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  </li>
            <li>It gives guidelines for how high to put the temp on for different situations and says to basically keep it moving through your hair.  </li>
            <li>A slight frizz left requires additional pass(es) to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>This is our first for wet hair.</li>
            <li>I often use a flat iron on my hair, not so much to straighten it, but to smooth my natural curls and give it some subtle waves.</li>
            <li>So thinking that they made some improvements since the last one released, I went ahead and gave this new one a try....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really works well on dry hair, and I will continue using it this way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does dry the hair and leave straight silky hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work especially since the plates are longer than my current straightener and it heats up almost immediately.</li>
            <li>As it starts to heat up, the light turns from yellow to a flashing green.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice and thin without much bulk compared to versions previous to this one.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was scorching my hair, as it seemed to require more time under iron than my other flat iron for dry hair use only.  </li>
            <li>I had some years ago, which had a painful habit of catching my hair between the casing and the hot plates, and then pulling it out or breaking it.</li>
            <li>It barely straightens.</li>
            <li>My waist length hair to straighten, but have always been curious as to how straight a straightning iron can get it -- and, how time consumming it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s wet 2 straight 1 inch straightener, you can forget the hairdryer and get going in no time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review it for the wet to straight feature.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on dripping wet (like straight out of the shower) hair</li>
            <li>S7211 Wet to Straight Straightener, 1 Inch.</li>
            <li>The Wet to Straight straightener takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li>Maximum temperature is 420 degrees Fahrenheit and there is an indicator light with amber for dry hair and green for damp</li>
            <li>If the hair are thick, they dry quickly and become straight in about 15 min.</li>
            <li>using it on wet hair, I did hear a little &#x27;sizzle&#x27; sound when passing it over my hair.  </li>
            <li>A small slide-type switch quickly powers the flat iron On/Off.  </li>
            <li>Saves me a ton of time not having to blow dry my hair completely before I straighten it.</li>
            <li>My hair only takes about 90 seconds to dry with a hair dryer, and to me, that&#x27;s much easier than using the straightener to dry it.  </li>
            <li>2-inch Remington S7231 can dry faster the same amount of hair than the 1-inch S-7211 or at the same time at lower temperature that is especially advantageous for a lot of fine hair left less damaged, dry, and brittle.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is thin and fine, I only use it on a moderate setting.  </li>

            <li> A vent channel -- which releases moisture as steam -- runs along the underside and top of the top ceramic plate, 2 rows, 5 vents each for a total of 10 steam vents.</li>
            <li> It quickly dries hair while straightening, which is convenient.  </li>
            <li> it really did provide nice straightening results without too much frizz.</li>
            <li> I’m always looking for ways to speed up my morning grooming routine, so I was very interested in trying the Remington Products</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and has a natural curl to it.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure is a good idea for me personally due to too much damage</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions are not that easy to find and they don’t say much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for fine straight hair</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely not the most manageable, it&#x27;s fairly fine</li>
            <li> This makes it smooth, silky and straight.</li>
            <li> The Teflon coating is effective at preventing sticking and overall</li>
            <li> It would be better to have the temperature marked in degrees</li>
            <li> the only thing is that since I&#x27;m straightening my own hair, the steam could be coming out the sides too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> just the right size.</li>
            <li> Remington S-7211 is less effective for a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li> Flat Iron, itself, feels sturdy, light weight and is easy to hold in hand.</li>
            <li> very, very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles,</li>
            <li> very, very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles,</li>
            <li> The top and bottom are very responsive when pressed together and quickly spring open when pressure is released.</li>
            <li> Hot water from the steam spits out onto your hand/wrist.</li>
            <li> It makes hair very frizzy!</li>
            <li> I found that it did indeed allow me to effectively style my wet, but towel dampened hair.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily my all-time favorite straightener,</li>
            <li> but I have a lot of it, which tends to be a challenge in a lot of styling situations, so someone will less problematic hair might have more luck but for me, this one is just a bit too cheap to work well on mine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the straightener took forever to dry it.</li>
            <li> This wet to straight technology is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron certainly works a lot better than the Remington</li>
            <li> Remington S7211 is a simple, straightforward product that is very reasonably priced and gets the job done without very much fuss to speak of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had a few Remington flat irons, and this is probably the best one of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly</li>
            <li> When the green light is steadily lit, the iron is fully heated and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several heating settings, which are selected by turning the nob located on the inside of the iron (very easy to get to, the nob is away from the heated part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> one has a temp control feature which is very nice due to everyone having different needs based on their hair texture and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is easy enough to determine the correct settings by trial and error.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this straightener is ok when I have used it on my dry</li>

            <li> Combed through hair with large tooth comb, sectioned hair with butterfly clips (or whatever you use) --</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work better with wet hair if you have shorter hair, but I really can’t say.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li> I think it is so convenient to be able to use it on wet hair.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Leaves my hair looking shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually fairly straight, but I have parts that look dry/flyaway.</li>
            <li> I really like that this has an adjustable heat control dial.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast (in less than a minute) and has a more than ample heat range up to 420 degrees.</li>
            <li> And if I don&#x27;t wash it, my hair stays straight for a couple days, only needs a quick touch up here and there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thirty second heat up: I am astonished at how quickly this straightener went straight to the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> It is lacking the capacity to process fine hair without leaving them feeling damaged, dry, and brittle.    </li>
            <li> 2 Straight 1-inch is easy to use and does a decent job on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have a few that give me better results, but they also cost six times as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly over your hair and straightens within the first few swipes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found with flat irons that you really get what you pay for, and this is a cheap flat iron.  </li>
            <li> They seem to really work, the hot steam really comes off when straightening from wet hair...</li>
            <li> likes that this helps her hair dry out in a nice quiet manner and at the same time straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a scorched feeling to my hair, just frizzier than normal and didn&#x27;t lay quite as flat and straight as it otherwise would.</li>
            <li> I used this Wet to Straight Straightener with mixed results - yes, it worked to steam my hair dry, which was a nice alternative to blowing it out.  </li>
            <li> : I used a couple of heat proof gloves made especially for handling hot irons, as the steam from the vents does get</li>
            <li> : I used a couple of heat proof gloves made especially for handling hot irons, as the steam from the vents does get</li>
            <li> It works OK, but I have to say with as much hair as I have, it really takes a long time to use this flat iron on wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you start with damp hair (not dripping wet) it is actually pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I found it ended up taking more time trying to use this on wet hair than it does just to blow dry it and then style my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for regular, normal use, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has fixed ceramic plates that heat up fast and the upper ones are vented to release steam when used on damp</li>
            <li> Now I have to be clear</li>
            <li> Have tried it 3 times &amp; had to get out my OLD straightener to re-do my hair, which is shoulder length hair.</li>

            <li> However, it requires several more passes than more expensive T3&#x27;s, such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it made it very frizzy and it actually started to smell burnt</li>
            <li> While using it on dry hair, it didn&#x27;t perform as well as my current hair straightener that is a bit higher end and works really well.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 quick passes (working from near crown and out/down) per section to completely dry My hair, a total of 20 minutes.</li>

            <li> It eliminates a step of needing to blow dry your hair first.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, and it is halfway down my back, so it takes a while to style it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re my go to brand for hair dryers, since they are powerful, inexpensive and last a long time.</li>
            <li> construction is solid, but the overall weight is only 10.7 oz., which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  </li>
            <li> It gives guidelines for how high to put the temp on for different situations and says to basically keep it moving through your hair.  </li>
            <li> A slight frizz left requires additional pass(es) to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> This is our first for wet hair.</li>
            <li> I often use a flat iron on my hair, not so much to straighten it, but to smooth my natural curls and give it some subtle waves.</li>
            <li> So thinking that they made some improvements since the last one released, I went ahead and gave this new one a try....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really works well on dry hair, and I will continue using it this way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does dry the hair and leave straight silky hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work especially since the plates are longer than my current straightener and it heats up almost immediately.</li>
            <li> As it starts to heat up, the light turns from yellow to a flashing green.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice and thin without much bulk compared to versions previous to this one.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was scorching my hair, as it seemed to require more time under iron than my other flat iron for dry hair use only.  </li>
            <li> I had some years ago, which had a painful habit of catching my hair between the casing and the hot plates, and then pulling it out or breaking it.</li>
            <li> It barely straightens.</li>
            <li> My waist length hair to straighten, but have always been curious as to how straight a straightning iron can get it -- and, how time consumming it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s wet 2 straight 1 inch straightener, you can forget the hairdryer and get going in no time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review it for the wet to straight feature.</li>

            <li> S7211 Wet to Straight Straightener, 1 Inch.</li>
            <li> The Wet to Straight straightener takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Maximum temperature is 420 degrees Fahrenheit and there is an indicator light with amber for dry hair and green for damp</li>
            <li> If the hair are thick, they dry quickly and become straight in about 15 min.</li>
            <li> using it on wet hair, I did hear a little &#x27;sizzle&#x27; sound when passing it over my hair.  </li>
            <li> A small slide-type switch quickly powers the flat iron On/Off.  </li>
            <li> Saves me a ton of time not having to blow dry my hair completely before I straighten it.</li>
            <li> My hair only takes about 90 seconds to dry with a hair dryer, and to me, that&#x27;s much easier than using the straightener to dry it.  </li>
            <li> 2-inch Remington S7231 can dry faster the same amount of hair than the 1-inch S-7211 or at the same time at lower temperature that is especially advantageous for a lot of fine hair left less damaged, dry, and brittle.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is thin and fine, I only use it on a moderate setting.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this would work for someone with thick or curly hair, but I think for the cost it would be worth try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The only downfall is, when you use it to dry/straighten wet hair, there is a lot of steam released, so I burned myself a few times using it the first time.</li>
            <li> but i have to press the hot plates together extra hard or it wont clamp on to my hair</li>
            <li> The extra long ceramic plates provide high, even, heat for less frizz.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product as she usually has to sleep with her hair wet when she showers at night as she did not want to disturb our little one with the super loud hair dryer that she currently uses.</li>

            <li> I have no idea why these type of flat irons even exist.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, using it on wet hair just seemed to scorch my hair too much for my liking, and took too long to dry it.</li>

            <li> This to her is like a 2-in-1 product that allows her to dry her hair and at the same time &#x27;comb&#x27; her hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have to run it 4-5 times over each chunk of hair to get it dry, and this method also made my hair a lot frizzier than if I just used a my chi on already dry hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look sleek and even seemed to give moisture to the dry ends.</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I do dry my hair slightly before I use it, but it&#x27;s never completely dry.</li>
            <li> So though I love the idea behind this, at least for me, it&#x27;s not a viable option.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact I used another version of a Remington wet to straight flat iron and  the results were not good.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair, and using a straightener instead of a traditional curling iron has given my awful hair a much better look.  </li>

            <li> I admit I fell victim to these flat irons not too long ago and had to learn the hard way,</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, or very long hair, the drying portion might actually be an issue.  </li>
            <li> I definitely had to adjust the way I usually straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick that to use a blow dryer on it is generally ineffective for anything but making stick-straight-out fuzzy-wuzzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten with other ceramic straighteners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a matter of practice, holding the hair with one hand and the straightener with the other and not burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> While this product does work, it takes a long time - as long as if not more time than blow drying then straightening with a different flat iron (at least for me, and I usually use a Chi straightener).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Remington&#x27;s wet 2 straight 1 inch straightener did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and even after blow drying for a long time, the very back middle/top part of my hair tends to sat damp without me realizing it.</li>
            <li> No matter the selected temoperature, the unit was ready in mere seconds.</li>

            <li> It was just a lot faster to get my hair done in the morning - less steps and quicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can use it with my hair still slightly damp.</li>
            <li> Plus, I think it&#x27;s probably less damaging as well.  </li>

            <li> Works great! I do dry my hair slightly before I use it, but it&#x27;s never completely dry. Saves me a ton of time not having to blow dry my hair completely before I straighten it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This straightener is awful! Have tried it 3 times &amp; had to get out my OLD straightener to re-do my hair, which is shoulder length hair. Hot water from the steam spits out onto your hand/wrist. It barely straightens. It makes hair very frizzy! If I hadn&#x27;t demolished the box trying to get it out, I would have returned it the same day! I absolutely hate it!!</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well. The only downfall is, when you use it to dry/straighten wet hair, there is a lot of steam released, so I burned myself a few times using it the first time. I definitely had to adjust the way I usually straighten my hair. But using it on dry hair is a breeze! Gets very hot very quickly. Glides smoothly over your hair and straightens within the first few swipes. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It should be called the balding straightener. My hair would get snagged on something in the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the issue was that the ceramic plates didn&#x27;t close well.</li>
            <li> Remington Products S7211 Wet2Straight Straightener, 1 Inch&lt;br /&gt;Category: Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually blow dry My waist length hair to straighten, but have always been curious as to how straight a straightning iron can get it -- and, how time consumming it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Remington&#x27;s wet 2 straight 1 inch straightener, you can forget the hairdryer and get going in no time. This straightener allows you to straighten whether your hair is wet or dry with 420-degree professional grade heat across ceramic plates, with 30 adjustable settings, as well as distinctive steam vents that dry and style hair with less damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box one finds a Remington S7211 Wet2Straight Straightener (1 Inch), a Use and Care Guide in English and a couple of $ off coupons for products to use with a Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flat Iron, itself, feels sturdy, light weight and is easy to hold in hand. The top and bottom are very responsive when pressed together and quickly spring open when pressure is released. The cord is 6 feet long and swivivels.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been intrigued by the idea of a wet to dry straightener for some time.  This model has a variety of heat settings and can be used on wet or dry hair.  That said, I was not especially impressed with the results.  Using it on wet hair took a long time.  I have thick hair, and on wet hair you have to do very small sections at a time.  This is not reasonable for morning use.  I felt like I was scorching my hair, as it seemed to require more time under iron than my other flat iron for dry hair use only.  The iron has extra vents to funnel out the excess steam produced by wet hair- you have to be careful to turn these away from your head so as not to burn yourself.  I&#x27;ve found with flat irons that you really get what you pay for, and this is a cheap flat iron.  It delivers cheap results.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Bought it during prime day and got it for $17. I&#x27;ve only used it on dry  hair, so I can&#x27;t review it for the wet to straight feature. To me it sounds scary, and I can just picture my thin hair burning off. So I won&#x27;t be trying that anytime soon. But for regular, normal use, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Remington is a good straightener for the price.  It quickly dries hair while straightening, which is convenient.  If you have thick hair, or very long hair, the drying portion might actually be an issue.  However,  in its price range, it&#x27;s still very good.  I think it could be better, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be in this price range.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on dripping wet (like straight out of the shower) hair I found that it did indeed allow me to effectively style my wet, but towel dampened hair. No hair dryer is necessary if you do a bit of towel drying first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington S7211 is a simple, straightforward product that is very reasonably priced and gets the job done without very much fuss to speak of. It heats up fast (in less than a minute) and has a more than ample heat range up to 420 degrees. The Teflon coating is effective at preventing sticking and overall it really did provide nice straightening results without too much frizz.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. I think it is so convenient to be able to use it on wet hair. It eliminates a step of needing to blow dry your hair first. I was always so worried with I used a regular one and my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry - with this one you don&#x27;t need to worry about it. It also heats up really fast, which is great when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time. I was pleased with the results. And at this price point, you sure get a lot. I would recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener does a good job straightening and shaping hair and it can be used on damp hair right out of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has fixed ceramic plates that heat up fast and the upper ones are vented to release steam when used on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power switch and a dial to adjust the temperature marked from L to 30 in increments of 5 are inside.  It would be better to have the temperature marked in degrees but it is easy enough to determine the correct settings by trial and error.  Maximum temperature is 420 degrees Fahrenheit and there is an indicator light with amber for dry hair and green for damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is solid, but the overall weight is only 10.7 oz., which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control but if it had floating plates, it would be a bit more responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat power cable is about 6 ft. long and and the connector has a flexible 90 degree angle and strain relief, plus it swivels infinitely.  An eyelet for hanging would be a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and have used a hair straightener for years to smooth my hair and give volume without kinks from curling iron. Unfortunately, Remington&#x27;s wet 2 straight 1 inch straightener did not work for my hair. The plates could not grip my hair. I really wanted it to work especially since the plates are longer than my current straightener and it heats up almost immediately. I can&#x27;t speak to how this would work for someone with thick or curly hair, but I think for the cost it would be worth try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Almost instant heating&lt;br /&gt;Longer plates than most straighteners&lt;br /&gt;Very inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;No need for blow dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for fine straight hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation, give it a try if you have thick and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Regardless of what anyone says.... It is not a good idea to flat iron your hair while wet. I have no idea why these type of flat irons even exist. All you will end up with is frizzy heat damaged hair!  I admit I fell victim to these flat irons not too long ago and had to learn the hard way, as a matter of fact I used another version of a Remington wet to straight flat iron and  the results were not good. So thinking that they made some improvements since the last one released, I went ahead and gave this new one a try.... same results different day.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron its self was not bad, because it worked great on dry hair, I just don&#x27;t think it works great on wet hair at all!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and straightens well. This worked on both my towel dried hair and my fully dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it on wet hair, I did hear a little &#x27;sizzle&#x27; sound when passing it over my hair.  Yes, that means it was working, but it also spooked me a little.  But, my hair looks fine, it&#x27;s not any more damaged using this than using the hair dryer first.  It was just a lot faster to get my hair done in the morning - less steps and quicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When turning it on, the indicator light is yellow.  As it starts to heat up, the light turns from yellow to a flashing green.  When the green light is steadily lit, the iron is fully heated and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several heating settings, which are selected by turning the nob located on the inside of the iron (very easy to get to, the nob is away from the heated part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light so it doesn&#x27;t get my hand/arms too tired using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair looking shiny and straight.  And if I don&#x27;t wash it, my hair stays straight for a couple days, only needs a quick touch up here and there.</li>
            <li> While this product does work, it takes a long time - as long as if not more time than blow drying then straightening with a different flat iron (at least for me, and I usually use a Chi straightener). I have really long, thick, curly/wavy hair and this just isn&#x27;t a good fit for me. I have to run it 4-5 times over each chunk of hair to get it dry, and this method also made my hair a lot frizzier than if I just used a my chi on already dry hair. Granted, I typically let my hair dry naturally and straighten it later that day or the following day, but when tested against blow dried then immediately straightened hair, this product didn&#x27;t match up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener does heat up very quickly, and is easy to use. I didn&#x27;t really get a scorched feeling to my hair, just frizzier than normal and didn&#x27;t lay quite as flat and straight as it otherwise would. So though I love the idea behind this, at least for me, it&#x27;s not a viable option.</li>
            <li> Tottally loved it! Best iron ever to me.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product as she usually has to sleep with her hair wet when she showers at night as she did not want to disturb our little one with the super loud hair dryer that she currently uses. Yes, our daughter woke up and cried when my wife was using the hair dryer one night and even within closed doors of the bathroom some distance away from our daughter&#x27;s crib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that this helps her hair dry out in a nice quiet manner and at the same time straighten her hair. The temperature control dial has variation for different types of hair and I would not recommend to use the highest temperature as it will cause damage to the hair. This to her is like a 2-in-1 product that allows her to dry her hair and at the same time &#x27;comb&#x27; her hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product that is all-purpose in our situation!</li>
            <li> Remington S-7211 Wet 2 Straight 1-inch is easy to use and does a decent job on wet hair. The straightener heats up in up to 1/2 min. incl. the hottest setting. If the hair are thick, they dry quickly and become straight in about 15 min. A slight frizz left requires additional pass(es) to smooth it out.  However, it requires several more passes than more expensive T3&#x27;s, such as [[ASIN:B0055RVPNO Straightening &amp; Styling]]. Remington S-7211 is less effective for a lot of fine hair. It is lacking the capacity to process fine hair without leaving them feeling damaged, dry, and brittle.    2-inch Remington S7231 can dry faster the same amount of hair than the 1-inch S-7211 or at the same time at lower temperature that is especially advantageous for a lot of fine hair left less damaged, dry, and brittle.</li>
            <li> This wet to straight technology is amazing.  My hair is so thick that to use a blow dryer on it is generally ineffective for anything but making stick-straight-out fuzzy-wuzzy hair.  There’s just no point to it.  When I am swimming every day, it seems like I can go weeks with wet hair.  That makes the Wet to Straight straightener the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thirty second heat up: I am astonished at how quickly this straightener went straight to the highest setting.  It started pouring out heat almost as soon as I turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are not that easy to find and they don’t say much.  It gives guidelines for how high to put the temp on for different situations and says to basically keep it moving through your hair.  The directions also point out to point the side with steam vents outwards.  It’s not rocket science.  It just works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this straightener. Like other reviewers, using it on wet hair just seemed to scorch my hair too much for my liking, and took too long to dry it. While using it on dry hair, it didn&#x27;t perform as well as my current hair straightener that is a bit higher end and works really well. With this straightener I have to make a few runs to get it as straight as I am looking for. My hair is definitely not the most manageable, it&#x27;s fairly fine but I have a lot of it, which tends to be a challenge in a lot of styling situations, so someone will less problematic hair might have more luck but for me, this one is just a bit too cheap to work well on mine.</li>
            <li> I often use a flat iron on my hair, not so much to straighten it, but to smooth my natural curls and give it some subtle waves. I have a lot of fine hair, and it is halfway down my back, so it takes a while to style it. I’m always looking for ways to speed up my morning grooming routine, so I was very interested in trying the Remington Products S7211 Wet to Straight Straightener, 1 Inch. With other flat irons, I have to completely dry my hair before using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this flat iron, however, you can use it on wet hair. It works OK, but I have to say with as much hair as I have, it really takes a long time to use this flat iron on wet hair. I found it ended up taking more time trying to use this on wet hair than it does just to blow dry it and then style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works well on dry hair, and I will continue using it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work better with wet hair if you have shorter hair, but I really can’t say.</li>
            <li> I had the bigger one before and loved it and got this one and it straightens good but i have to press the hot plates together extra hard or it wont clamp on to my hair (if that make any sense lol) but besides that i love it !!</li>
            <li> I used this Wet to Straight Straightener with mixed results - yes, it worked to steam my hair dry, which was a nice alternative to blowing it out.  I used a heat protectant serum and a lotion type styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet hair:  On the hottest setting, it did straighten my hair nicely, but it wasn&#x27;t the silky straight I&#x27;ve gotten with other ceramic straighteners.  It was a bit more brittle than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair:  It works with a few swipes, similarly to my other straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vents:  They seem to really work, the hot steam really comes off when straightening from wet hair... the only thing is that since I&#x27;m straightening my own hair, the steam could be coming out the sides too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it works well!  Not necessarily my all-time favorite straightener, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> This flat iron certainly works a lot better than the Remington I had some years ago, which had a painful habit of catching my hair between the casing and the hot plates, and then pulling it out or breaking it. I&#x27;ve actually had a few Remington flat irons, and this is probably the best one of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and I can use it with my hair still slightly damp. I have very thick hair and even after blow drying for a long time, the very back middle/top part of my hair tends to sat damp without me realizing it. I can use this flat iron on it and it will dry it our while smoothing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of flatirons, from very cheap ones to very expensive ones. This is a good iron for the price. I have a few that give me better results, but they also cost six times as much as this one. So for this price point, this flat iron is a great choice. Remington also makes nice hair dryers and curling irons as well, all well priced. They&#x27;re my go to brand for hair dryers, since they are powerful, inexpensive and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was skeptical about a hair straightener that can be used on dry or wet hair. The only straighteners I&#x27;ve used have always been for dry hair only. My hair is actually fairly straight, but I have parts that look dry/flyaway. I tried this product a few times. It&#x27;s a nice nice design; just the right size. There&#x27;s a dial to set the temp and this device shuts off automatically if you forget to unplug it. It worked great on dry hair and really great on wet hair! My hair was wet, not sopping obviously, but definitely not dry. I ran the iron over several pieces of my shoulder length hair. It made my hair look sleek and even seemed to give moisture to the dry ends. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> My experience with this straightener is ok when I have used it on my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it on my damp/ towel dried hair it made it very frizzy and it actually started to smell burnt&lt;br /&gt;even though i had the temp down. Now I have to be clear I have fine crazy curly long hair. Normally I only ever just towel dry my hair because anything else makes it so frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use this  straightener once my hair has dried but to go wet to straight I am not so sure is a good idea for me personally due to too much damage it would cause.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a temp control feature which is very nice due to everyone having different needs based on their hair texture and volume.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and thin without much bulk compared to versions previous to this one.</li>
            <li> The Wet to Straight straightener takes a bit of getting used to. It&#x27;s just a matter of practice, holding the hair with one hand and the straightener with the other and not burning your fingers. On wet hair, you have to be careful of the steam that escapes. However, with some practice, it produces really nice results. My hair is very fine and has a natural curl to it. This makes it smooth, silky and straight.</li>
            <li> We have a lot of hair in this house so we have lots of styling tools. We have probably had 10 straighteners over the years. This is our first for wet hair. I mostly liked it. It does dry the hair and leave straight silky hair. If you start with damp hair (not dripping wet) it is actually pretty fast. I didn&#x27;t notice increased damage in the 30 days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that I sometimes get little bumps because the plates don&#x27;t glide. They seem to stick a little here and there. I am not sure how to solve that problem. But at this price I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry my hair. I have very fine hair and the straightener took forever to dry it. Drying my hair took longer than it would have had I used a blow dryer and then a straightener. Even though it boasts about vents to air out the hair, I still felt as if I was frying my hair. When I was done, my hair felt brittle and a bit damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> I received this Remington hair straightener through the Amazon Vine Review program.  So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with it.  I have very fine and thin hair, and using a straightener instead of a traditional curling iron has given my awful hair a much better look.  I&#x27;ve only used it with wet hair once.  My hair only takes about 90 seconds to dry with a hair dryer, and to me, that&#x27;s much easier than using the straightener to dry it.  Plus, I think it&#x27;s probably less damaging as well.  I really like that this has an adjustable heat control dial.  Since my hair is thin and fine, I only use it on a moderate setting.  The ceramic plates glide easily over my hair, with no pulling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Fries hair as it dries it.</li>
