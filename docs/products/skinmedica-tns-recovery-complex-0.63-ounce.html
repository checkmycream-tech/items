            <li>Just ordered more from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product once a day for the better part of 3 years.</li>
            <li>Cosmetically, this is no substitute for IPL or lazer treatments, but it is improving my skin and keeping it healthy.</li>
            <li>Again, I really love the way my skin feels after this routine.</li>
            <li>even the most hardened carnivore wanting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this produce for quite sometime; I love it</li>
            <li>Not to say it was any better</li>
            <li>I love the way it has changed my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>Complex!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I had never received so many compliments on my skin and/or comments on how I did not look my age until using SkimMedica products.</li>
            <li>Remarkable stuff and really works.  </li>
            <li>After all, who wants a face lift if one can avoid it with good skin care?</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference in my age spots..</li>
            <li>This is just such a great product...</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Recovery Complex\\&quot; is a bizarre name for this product.  </li>
            <li>;  She had recommended TNS Recovery Serum, which is the primary reason I bought it.  </li>
            <li>tall dispenser that won&#x27;t even fit in a quart size bag for travel.  </li>
            <li>I had read it is important to check the lot number and&lt;br</li>
            <li>in a fit of pique I returned it</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li>I based my rating on what my dermatologist told me the last time I saw her: &amp;#34;Your skin looks good and has elasticity [important criterion in judging skin quality].&amp;#34</li>
            <li>the tns recovery complex is a great product i have used for years,it is lightweight and easy to apply.i love it.</li>
            <li>The color was a bright red and the scent was, well, think of an athlete&#x27;s sweaty socks that was put in a box for a couple of days then opened up.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, but I can&#x27;t afford to spend that much every month, so I am so glad to have found it on Amazon for half the cost, delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, since it is a pumper bottle you have to open the top many times to scoop out the remaining product that the pumper doesn&#x27;t dispense.</li>
            <li>Within the first week, I could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely furious, but should have known that if the price was that low ($79.40 plus shipping and tax) that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I wait to apply makeup until my cream/lotion has thoroughly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Unless someone else has had success with the \\&quot;call Skinmedica before buying\\&quot; method mentioned in another review.  </li>
            <li>sure the product is fresh or under 2 years old.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel a little tight--firm really--and then I apply a good cream afterwards.</li>
            <li>it smells funny</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I really love the way this routine makes my facial skin feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and have a lot of sun damage from too many deep tans.</li>
            <li>I am turning 54 tomorrow and last week when I went in for more Botox and filler injections, my doctor said I didn&#x27;t even need anything done.</li>
            <li>Sure enough when I checked mine there was the hole!  </li>
            <li>Can feel and see results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I just ran out of my first bottle, which by the way lasted me exactly 48 days using one pump each morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>read a review here and wish there was a way I could have check the number on the box before purchasing, although I cannot imagine how the seller would be able to check the specific bottle that would be shipped to me, hold it on the side for me while I contacted Skinmedica to check on the \\&quot;made\\&quot; date.  </li>
            <li>Then trust that the seller would send the exact bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>also read one reviewer who is using the product only once a day in the morning stating that she didn&#x27;t need it at night because she&#x27;s only going to sleep and doesn&#x27;t need to look good while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>You do not want to purchase this product if it has expired because it could be LESS EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li>When I initially bought it, there was a 72-year old woman in the doctor&#x27;s office whom I actually asked if she had some kind of surgery because her facial skin looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also, the scent is slightly different and not as strong as the one I purchased from the surgeons office.  </li>
            <li>I have notice a big difference in my skin tone as well appearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will look so much brighter, trust me...</li>
            <li>The scar is visibly fading so fast, I have to order another one.  </li>
            <li>I figure I have spent way more on products that don&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>This helps spread the gel very evenly</li>
            <li>In addition to the serum and injections, I have had 2 professional, 1mm Needle Roller treatments, and I found that if I put some of this serum on, as soon as I get home afterward, it absorbs right in and my skin tightens up immediately.</li>
            <li>I went through the first bottle and gave it the old \\&quot;one week off\\&quot; test to see what would happen</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I use it every other night rotating with my other skincare regime and it makes your skin instantly feel amazing and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again but only at the surgeons office since I cannot depend on the product sold here being fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I am always trying new products...</li>
            <li>and I can feel it dry quickly.</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe I received old stock!  </li>
            <li>So yes, make sure it is not more than 2 years old, but buy this product if you need to treat a scar or want tovisibly rejuvenate skin.  </li>
            <li>It got rid of my fine lines and a little deeper wrinkle around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I knew there was something different about it since it didn&#x27;t smell the same; it also was not the bright red color it usually is but a light pink.</li>
            <li>My son commented yesterday about my appearance and said the words 35 years old...</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am 46 yrs old</li>
            <li>Her face was taut, soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>And I do look young for my age, but</li>
            <li>this stuff really does the trick and makes you look just that extra bit fresher.  </li>
            <li>The store I bought it from is called Complete Skin Care and was purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>There is amazing science behind this, and it&#x27;s a little surprising when you see a red gel that is a little smelly, and that&#x27;s supposed to go on your skin and work wonders, but it does.  </li>
            <li>When I pumped from the bottle I bought here, I was disappointed because the color is NOT the bright red as my original bottle but instead was a light red with a slight rust tint.  </li>
            <li>I have confirmed with Skin Medica, the manufacturer, that TNS Recovery Complex has a 2 year expiration life span.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just used to the smell, but I really don&#x27;t notice an \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell and never really have.</li>
            <li>Love the item use it all the time however the pump was broken this time</li>
            <li>So if you use it only once a day you&#x27;re missing the full benefit of the product.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because if you buy a TNS Recovery Complex that was manufactured over 2 years then the TNS gel could be LESS EFFECTIVE because the ingredients breakdown after 2 years.</li>
            <li>after I started using it, people really started noticing that I had gotten rid of the dark spots...</li>
            <li>Besides the unnecessarily large container is a total waste of material for the dispenser and the box it comes in.</li>

            <li> I would buy it again but only at the surgeons office since I cannot depend on the product sold here being fresh.  </li>
            <li> and I am always trying new products...</li>
            <li> and I can feel it dry quickly.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe I received old stock!  </li>
            <li> So yes, make sure it is not more than 2 years old, but buy this product if you need to treat a scar or want tovisibly rejuvenate skin.  </li>
            <li> It got rid of my fine lines and a little deeper wrinkle around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I knew there was something different about it since it didn&#x27;t smell the same; it also was not the bright red color it usually is but a light pink.</li>
            <li> My son commented yesterday about my appearance and said the words 35 years old...</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am 46 yrs old</li>
            <li> Her face was taut, soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> And I do look young for my age, but</li>
            <li> this stuff really does the trick and makes you look just that extra bit fresher.  </li>
            <li> The store I bought it from is called Complete Skin Care and was purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There is amazing science behind this, and it&#x27;s a little surprising when you see a red gel that is a little smelly, and that&#x27;s supposed to go on your skin and work wonders, but it does.  </li>
            <li> When I pumped from the bottle I bought here, I was disappointed because the color is NOT the bright red as my original bottle but instead was a light red with a slight rust tint.  </li>
            <li> I have confirmed with Skin Medica, the manufacturer, that TNS Recovery Complex has a 2 year expiration life span.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just used to the smell, but I really don&#x27;t notice an \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell and never really have.</li>
            <li> Love the item use it all the time however the pump was broken this time</li>
            <li> So if you use it only once a day you&#x27;re missing the full benefit of the product.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because if you buy a TNS Recovery Complex that was manufactured over 2 years then the TNS gel could be LESS EFFECTIVE because the ingredients breakdown after 2 years.</li>
            <li> after I started using it, people really started noticing that I had gotten rid of the dark spots...</li>
            <li> Besides the unnecessarily large container is a total waste of material for the dispenser and the box it comes in.</li>
            <li> I use only a single pump&#x27;s worth--a pretty small amount of gel--and dot it all over my face only after putting a very small amount of water on my face first.</li>
            <li> From reading their description, it was made to sound as if this was a healing product (originally used on burn victims, blah blah blah), but it was horribly damaging to my skin, which is not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> my minor jowls do look a bit</li>
            <li> Instead, it left my skin burned and red, dry, peeling and horribly tight.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific product to help promote skin growth and scar recovery on the face or other places.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time also because you only need to use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> the bottom of the outside packaging box, there is a 6 digit black Lot Number stamped on the box.</li>
            <li> The color of the gel was brownish which is a signal that the TNS complex recovery gel was old.</li>
            <li> I expected something with the word \\&quot;recovery\\&quot; in it to provide healing and nourishment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I bought a second bottle here a few weeks ago after finding it on-line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that state</li>
            <li> Now, I want to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Plus I have skin darkening on the face due to pre-menopausal hormonal changes, and have been using the excess after putting it on the scar, on my face.  </li>
            <li> i use this every other night</li>
            <li> Over time (albeit slowly), this routine has lightened up some of the darker spots and given me an overall smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on any other product.</li>
            <li> When I found it on Amazon at almost 40% less than what I paid</li>
            <li> I trust the foreskin used would otherwise be removed and discarded were there not any need for it in science or the making of TNS skincare products, but it is a little disconcerting that I can&#x27;t find any information on how they do acquire it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few of my friends and they swear by it as well</li>
            <li> I began using this product along with the eye repair cream just a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because it is expensive...</li>
            <li> It is insulting to think that the company actually thinks the purchaser believes they are getting a substantial amount of product because they put a miniscule amount of product in a ridiculously large container.</li>
            <li> Not sure where this product originates, but another customer warned of diluted TNS Recovery Complex and mentioned looking for holes drilled in the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for trying so hard.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I attended a skin rejuvenation presentation and then bought the Skinmedica TNS Recovery Complex from the presenter who is a plastic surgeon.  </li>
            <li> yet the bottle is twice the size of the Vitamin C &amp; E complex which contains 1 oz.  </li>
            <li> It is ridiculous to put .63 oz of product in a 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad, but knowing where it comes from, the look and smell is not surprising -- and actually guarantees that it is what they say it is -- TNS in it&#x27;s purest form.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if it has helped me???!!!  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product so</li>
            <li> and I am sad to say, I need this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to take before pics but</li>
            <li> I like the product although the packaging is absurd.  </li>
            <li> I was sooo wrong!</li>
            <li> but it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in that fact since it is a pricy</li>
            <li> Dreadful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever bought for my skin! My dermatologist recommended.  I just ordered another bottle and can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive because I am all out!!</li>
            <li> Fast service and a great price.  This product was a lot cheaper than what the doctors office wanted. I will deal with this company again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!  It is very good for sensitive skin and Amazon has the best price!  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that state it smells funny....I don&#x27;t notice the smell and neither does any of my friends.</li>
            <li> TNS was recommended to me by the aesthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s. I use it every other night rotating with my other skincare regime and it makes your skin instantly feel amazing and smooth. It works while you sleep to repair and improve skin texture and tone. I knew I was going to keep using it but it was very expensive. When I found it on Amazon at almost 40% less than what I paid I was thrilled. I love the way it works over time to keep improving the look of my skin. My pores are smaller and that is what makes your skin look smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I had used a bottle of this earlier in the year. I visited family about a month after using this product and was told how I look so \\&quot;great\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;youthful\\&quot;. I stopped buying because of the price but after several months my skin just drooped. I bought it again and 30 days later....well the result is AMAZING. My son commented yesterday about my appearance and said the words 35 years old...I&#x27;m 56! He is a great kid, but I&#x27;ll say 45. My skin loves this. I have been a sun worshipper my entire life. You know if it improves that kind of damage, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used this product regularly over the years. I gave this 3 stars because if you buy a TNS Recovery Complex that was manufactured over 2 years then the TNS gel could be LESS EFFECTIVE because the ingredients breakdown after 2 years. I have confirmed with Skin Medica, the manufacturer, that TNS Recovery Complex has a 2 year expiration life span. Skin Medica advised me not to purchase this product if it is over 2 years old.&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom of the outside packaging box, there is a 6 digit black Lot Number stamped on the box. If you call skinmedica.com at their toll free number, and give them 6 digit lot number they are happy to tell you when the product was manufactured. Unfortunately, I recently purchased this product which was manufactured 2 years 3 months. The color of the gel was brownish which is a signal that the TNS complex recovery gel was old. I do not think that sellers are intentionally  selling expired products but these products are sitting in shelves waiting to get purchased. My recommendation is to try to contact the seller and get the 6 digit lot number &amp; contact skinmedica.com to find out the manufacturer date BEFORE you buy this product. This is an expensive product so \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot;!! You do not want to purchase this product if it has expired because it could be LESS EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> I have notice a big difference in my skin tone as well appearance of fine lines.  Remarkable stuff and really works.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I am 46 yrs old and I have noticed a huge difference in my age spots.. They have faded and my skin is brighter and tighter.  I have never been so impressed with a skin care product.  It also helps with healing of scars from pimples.  The vitamin C &amp; E is awesome.  It helps the scars heal and fade.  This is just such a great product... Just ordered more from Amazon.  It lasts a long time also because you only need to use a little bit.  Your skin will look so much brighter, trust me...</li>
            <li> This product clears your skin and helps with the elasticity in your skin.  I love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works well with the dermal skin repair cream. I have tried it for a month now and notice a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s brighter and smoother. Now, I want to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now on my scar (a giant one that one gets after a \\&quot;tummy tuck.\\&quot;  It is absolutely amazing.  Plus I have skin darkening on the face due to pre-menopausal hormonal changes, and have been using the excess after putting it on the scar, on my face.  The scar is visibly fading so fast, I have to order another one.  When there are such benefits, who cares about the price?  I figure I have spent way more on products that don&#x27;t work at all.  There is amazing science behind this, and it&#x27;s a little surprising when you see a red gel that is a little smelly, and that&#x27;s supposed to go on your skin and work wonders, but it does.  TNS comes from the discarded foreskin after circumcision (yes, of baby boys), which would probably account for the male smell mentioned by another reviewer.  I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad, but knowing where it comes from, the look and smell is not surprising -- and actually guarantees that it is what they say it is -- TNS in it&#x27;s purest form. I trust the foreskin used would otherwise be removed and discarded were there not any need for it in science or the making of TNS skincare products, but it is a little disconcerting that I can&#x27;t find any information on how they do acquire it.  Nevertheless, it is certainly an amazing product.  When I initially bought it, there was a 72-year old woman in the doctor&#x27;s office whom I actually asked if she had some kind of surgery because her facial skin looked amazing.  She told me she has had no work done, said TNS is the only thing she uses and she swears by it.  Her face was taut, soft and glowing.  And I do look young for my age, but after I started using it, people really started noticing that I had gotten rid of the dark spots... (I combine it with another product, the \\&quot;signature cream\\&quot;) and everyone is telling me I look way younger than ... going on 50.  So yes, make sure it is not more than 2 years old, but buy this product if you need to treat a scar or want tovisibly rejuvenate skin.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year and love it. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few of my friends and they swear by it as well</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product to help promote skin growth and scar recovery on the face or other places. It also aids in wound recovery.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because it is expensive...Amazon has the best price I could find...I have noticed my skin seems smoother and clearer...I like the effect! I am 66 and have always taken care of my skin and I am always trying new products...I am on my 2nd bottle...I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product once a day for the better part of 3 years. Perhaps I&#x27;m just used to the smell, but I really don&#x27;t notice an \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell and never really have. I use only a single pump&#x27;s worth--a pretty small amount of gel--and dot it all over my face only after putting a very small amount of water on my face first. This helps spread the gel very evenly and I can feel it dry quickly. It does make my skin feel a little tight--firm really--and then I apply a good cream afterwards. I wait to apply makeup until my cream/lotion has thoroughly absorbed. I really love the way this routine makes my facial skin feel. I&#x27;m 52 and have a lot of sun damage from too many deep tans. Over time (albeit slowly), this routine has lightened up some of the darker spots and given me an overall smoother appearance. Cosmetically, this is no substitute for IPL or lazer treatments, but it is improving my skin and keeping it healthy. Again, I really love the way my skin feels after this routine.</li>
            <li> this stuff really does the trick and makes you look just that extra bit fresher.  I went through the first bottle and gave it the old \\&quot;one week off\\&quot; test to see what would happen and I am sad to say, I need this stuff.  I had seen warnings that some people had expired product, but I got my bottle, called the company and it is was only manufactured last month, with a two year shelf life.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this at my Derm/Botox Doc&#x27;s office for $155. It worked great, but I can&#x27;t afford to spend that much every month, so I am so glad to have found it on Amazon for half the cost, delivered to my door. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully, twice a day, for 6 months now and my skin looks great. I am turning 54 tomorrow and last week when I went in for more Botox and filler injections, my doctor said I didn&#x27;t even need anything done. In addition to the serum and injections, I have had 2 professional, 1mm Needle Roller treatments, and I found that if I put some of this serum on, as soon as I get home afterward, it absorbs right in and my skin tightens up immediately. I also use sunscreen daily and wear a visor every time I go outside for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I thought I would save some money by buying this on line and NOT through a licensed distributor...I was sooo wrong! I called Skin Medica and found out that this product was expired. I knew there was something different about it since it didn&#x27;t smell the same; it also was not the bright red color it usually is but a light pink. Last time I try to save a couple of bucks</li>
            <li> Product as described and arrived on time as promised. Price was fair. Good job, would purchase again.  Thank you for trying so hard.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Recovery Complex\\&quot; is a bizarre name for this product.  I expected something with the word \\&quot;recovery\\&quot; in it to provide healing and nourishment.  Instead, it left my skin burned and red, dry, peeling and horribly tight.  From reading their description, it was made to sound as if this was a healing product (originally used on burn victims, blah blah blah), but it was horribly damaging to my skin, which is not overly sensitive.  What I ended up needing was a recovery from this serum.  Dreadful.</li>
            <li> Amazing results with this product  over time with continuous use. It tightens the pores and skin feels refreshed and nourished.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
            <li> I am 62, this has made a difference in my skin tone, lines and even my under eye puffiness. But, the product runs out so quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it but just seems that there is not enough product in the bottle to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure where this product originates, but another customer warned of diluted TNS Recovery Complex and mentioned looking for holes drilled in the bottom of the bottle.  Sure enough when I checked mine there was the hole!  The store I bought it from is called Complete Skin Care and was purchased through Amazon.  I am absolutely furious, but should have known that if the price was that low ($79.40 plus shipping and tax) that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a physician as one of the best products to help keep wrinkles away!  And it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best cookbook I&#x27;ve ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;The photos are amazing and the recipes are imaginative and surprisingly easy to execute.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Amy&#x27;s descriptive writing and Justin&#x27;s brilliant photo&#x27;s leaves even the most hardened carnivore wanting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have to hear more from this talented duo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they are daughter and son In law&lt;br /&gt;Only makes it better! We get to dine with them&lt;br /&gt;Often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift for any occasion!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for quite sometime; I love it and I never want to be without it. The price is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is a great eye cream. I try a lot of products online, from spas, and plastic surgeons. This has been the best. It got rid of my fine lines and a little deeper wrinkle around my eyes. Can feel and see results after the first use.</li>
            <li> Love the item use it all the time however the pump was broken this time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on any other product. This is the only product that works. Within the first week, I could tell a huge difference. I have had several compliments about my skin. I look like I just came from the spa and had a facial. Best product on the market. Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I attended a skin rejuvenation presentation and then bought the Skinmedica TNS Recovery Complex from the presenter who is a plastic surgeon.  The color was a bright red and the scent was, well, think of an athlete&#x27;s sweaty socks that was put in a box for a couple of days then opened up.  Ugh!  Smells like moldy b.o.  Anyway, I did get used to the smell after a couple of weeks.  Not to say it was any better but it didn&#x27;t evoke my gag reflex, lol!  I was unable to take before pics but my minor jowls do look a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought a second bottle here a few weeks ago after finding it on-line.  I just ran out of my first bottle, which by the way lasted me exactly 48 days using one pump each morning and evening.  When I pumped from the bottle I bought here, I was disappointed because the color is NOT the bright red as my original bottle but instead was a light red with a slight rust tint.  Also, the scent is slightly different and not as strong as the one I purchased from the surgeons office.  This leads me to believe I received old stock!  Very disappointed in that fact since it is a pricy product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review here and wish there was a way I could have check the number on the box before purchasing, although I cannot imagine how the seller would be able to check the specific bottle that would be shipped to me, hold it on the side for me while I contacted Skinmedica to check on the \\&quot;made\\&quot; date.  Then trust that the seller would send the exact bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read one reviewer who is using the product only once a day in the morning stating that she didn&#x27;t need it at night because she&#x27;s only going to sleep and doesn&#x27;t need to look good while sleeping.  According to the plastic surgeon, the products should be used twice a day (a.m. and p.m.) because it works to sort of regenerate the skins elasticity eventually making the skin tighter.  So if you use it only once a day you&#x27;re missing the full benefit of the product.  I would buy it again but only at the surgeons office since I cannot depend on the product sold here being fresh.  Unless someone else has had success with the \\&quot;call Skinmedica before buying\\&quot; method mentioned in another review.  I&#x27;d love to know how successful that was.</li>
            <li> I based my rating on what my dermatologist told me the last time I saw her: &amp;#34;Your skin looks good and has elasticity [important criterion in judging skin quality].&amp;#34;  She had recommended TNS Recovery Serum, which is the primary reason I bought it.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  After all, who wants a face lift if one can avoid it with good skin care?</li>
            <li> I like the product although the packaging is absurd.  The product contains only .63 oz yet the bottle is twice the size of the Vitamin C &amp; E complex which contains 1 oz.  It is ridiculous to put .63 oz of product in a 6&amp;#34; tall dispenser that won&#x27;t even fit in a quart size bag for travel.  It is insulting to think that the company actually thinks the purchaser believes they are getting a substantial amount of product because they put a miniscule amount of product in a ridiculously large container. Skin Medica evidently attempts to deceive the purchaser in regard to the small amount of product they are buying at an exorbitant price.  Besides the unnecessarily large container is a total waste of material for the dispenser and the box it comes in. Furthermore, since it is a pumper bottle you have to open the top many times to scoop out the remaining product that the pumper doesn&#x27;t dispense.</li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth the money. I love the way it has changed my skins appearance. I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Skinmedica TNS Recovery Complex!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 10 years.  It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> i use this every other night but i&#x27;m not sure if it has helped me???!!!  i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll repurchase them again!</li>
            <li> the tns recovery complex is a great product i have used for years,it is lightweight and easy to apply.i love it.</li>
            <li> Because I was suspicious of tampering, I returned the product. I had read it is important to check the lot number and&lt;br /&gt;make sure the product is fresh or under 2 years old. Also I read here that tampered bottles have holes on the bottom, which mine did.&lt;br /&gt;So in a fit of pique I returned it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since learned from Skin Medica that the hole is part of the air pump. Hmmm.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this wonderful product that it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I began using this product along with the eye repair cream just a few months ago.  I had never received so many compliments on my skin and/or comments on how I did not look my age until using SkimMedica products. I think they are a great preventative measure and excellent investment in yourself!</li>
