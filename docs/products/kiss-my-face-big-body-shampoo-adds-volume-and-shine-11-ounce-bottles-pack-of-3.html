    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real win for me.  </li>
            <li>The best verdict, I guess, is from my wife, who told me, &amp;#34;Well, I guess I&#x27;ll use that, too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best flavor for me.</li>
            <li>All I can say is I am very impressed</li>
            <li>This is a perfect shampoo for my hair!  </li>
            <li>but my hair is fuller and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Used wth KMF conditionder, a great combition to great feeling and looking hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great for body, volumizing, and shine and one I faithful return to, even take to hair salon on occasion when I get a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>I then opened the lid on one to smell it, and I really liked the smell!</li>
            <li>So this will be a good experiment for me.</li>
            <li>Vey good cleaning without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>When a hair product has more of an effect on my hair than lopping off 3 inches, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li>My hair went frizzy and had a mind of its own both days</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>, just nice.</li>
            <li>I will say that I have never been really impressed with any natural shampoos though.</li>
            <li>On a whim I checked to see if Amazon offered it and glad I did - great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Not so many reviews, but after searching the internet, I saw nobody saying that this had harmful chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>Better buy.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the conditioner and love it as well.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a tip-off that they&#x27;ve changed the formula to make the product more cost-efficient (so they could afford the Argan oil?).</li>
            <li>Big Body is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>the product itself is ok</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a lovely peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>I have bleached blonde hair and this combo is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and I even got some compliments that my hair looks better after using it.  </li>
            <li>I like it and have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice fresh smell!</li>
            <li>My first impression of these shampoos upon opening the box was \\&quot;Wow awesome bottles!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is the first organic shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It was a very pleasant surprise to find that this product does everything my previous stuff did, and more.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and pretty much guaranteed a good hair day for me (with the shampoo bars my hair was rather hit or miss), but one thing I loved about the tea tree bar I was using is that it let me wash my hair every other day instead of every day (with some corn starch before bed).  </li>
            <li>it is also one of the safer shampoos available.</li>
            <li>, now my hair is *happy* again; once you use organic hair products, I don&#x27;t think your hair will be happy with the &#x27;same old chemical junk&#x27; readily sold in stores and salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A shampoo that leaves my hair feeling REALLY clean...</li>
            <li>but I tend to have greasy hair and find that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it stays clean for a prolonged time.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying this Shampoo along with its complimentary conditioner for my long/ fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>Works good for my fine dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and this shampoo gives it some nice body, plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li>did do an experiement before starting my third bottles, in which I switched over to Pantene Beautiful Lengths for a day, and WHOA could I tell the difference!</li>
            <li>Rinses out quickly also.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the companion conditioner and must say I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The oil doesn&#x27;t seem to change much apart than the scent (which I don&#x27;t care for because it&#x27;s strong and to lingers all day)</li>
            <li>This might be too drying for the length of my (admittedly damaged because I don&#x27;t get it cut often enough) hair without the conditioner, but together, I love my KMF hair!</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean after the first wash.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, fine hair of medium thickness, and very oily skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for my hair and better for the environment, but the brand I was using made my fine hair limp and lifeless -</li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;ll use a pantene shampoo to really strip my hair clean</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the shampoo gets more foamy than other natural products</li>
            <li>No chemicals, goes on easy, washes off well and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>While this left my hair feeling clean, and I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals, it did nothing for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old guy, and I have really fine hair.</li>
            <li>My Face shampoo at the grocery store and got the Whenever variety first.  </li>
            <li>Just last week, I started getting all kinds of comments about my \\&quot;cute</li>
            <li>(If you don&#x27;t know why I seek things that have no palm oil, try a Google search for &amp;#34;palm oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;orangutans.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>the other reviewers say that the longer you use it the better your hair gets!</li>
            <li>If massive body isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re after, then you might want to consider this organic combo. :)</li>
            <li>then Big Body is the organic for you. :)</li>
            <li>I like the tablespoon of baking soda and 1 cup water shampoo, but this is so much nicer with the same real, real clean effect.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>So either this shampoo has something in there thats not natural to help with the lather, or they have now perfected making a good lather with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It did not make much of a difference to texture yet, but I&#x27;m sure one wash can&#x27;t really make your hair drastically different.</li>
            <li>Although I have to say that the absolute best thing for my hair is excersizing, that really makes it look the mostspringy and the least flat.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to a month ago.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff, this Big Body shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I figured my experiment really *ticked-off*</li>
            <li>Worse, when I rinse the product off it gets on my skin and causes irritation unlike anything I&#x27;ve experienced with KMF before.</li>
            <li>, I feel like 3 bottles is too much.</li>
            <li>I find I get a slightly better lather if I freshly wet my hair</li>
            <li>If anybody knows of a product that&#x27;s more like what the old Big Body used to be, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, I shampoo about every 3 days, other shampoos tend to weigh my hair down and don&#x27;t smell as good either!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and can&#x27;t be weighed down with too much product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would love it.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, and this shampoo works well for me.</li>
            <li>have long color-treated fine hair</li>
            <li>I had been searching for something like this that left hair clean and gave it body.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>It does take a generous portion of the product to make foam, but it leaves your hair feeling clean and not coarse and</li>
            <li>and I do think that KMF big body does do a good job of not weighing down my hair-</li>
            <li>So after searching far and wide for a nice natural shampoo, I settled on this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much lather it made!</li>
            <li>Thats not a bad thing because this shampoo is doing the same thing as my Dove shampoo sans the chemicals!</li>
            <li>I used the previous version (in the green bottle) for years and loved it because I have sensitive hair and skin and this kept me clean and intact.</li>
            <li>new haircut,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>But the big story is the first ingredient is now \\&quot;aqua\\&quot; (that&#x27;s water), and not \\&quot;aloe barbadensis\\&quot; like it was before.</li>
            <li>While it does lather better than other organic brands, I always notice a big difference when I use someone else&#x27;s non-organic shampoo or products at a hotel, etc.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>my hair with all those chemicals, and quickly I went back to Big Body</li>
            <li>I am 44 yrs old and color my hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that will be gentle enough to use.</li>
            <li>My husband has short very curly hair</li>
            <li>short: I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I actually like a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo (this is my second time buying it).</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps I hadn&#x27;t tried it long enough to see signs of improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m at the end of the first bottles of shampoo and conditioner (they are each sold in sets of three).</li>
            <li>edit: also note they&#x27;ve added Green Tea extract to this formula, so if you react poorly to very small doses of caffeine, this may not be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about a week so far</li>
            <li>The new version has the same name but is in a white bottle and claims \\&quot;now with Argan oil.\\</li>
            <li>I decided to try out Big Body to see if it had the same effect, and while I still have a little bit more oil in my hair on the second day (which a little bit better corn starch application before bed can help) than I might prefer, I can use this every other day and not feel like a walking oil slick on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>My scalp tend to get greasy, even though I dont put any product in typically, and I went through this too fast.</li>
            <li>a few seconds before applying, or apply, wet again quickly, and then lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So after searching far and wide for a nice natural shampoo, I settled on this. Not so many reviews, but after searching the internet, I saw nobody saying that this had harmful chemicals in it. I was a little worried to order this 3 pack, but I did in the end. My first impression of these shampoos upon opening the box was \\&quot;Wow awesome bottles!\\&quot;. I then opened the lid on one to smell it, and I really liked the smell! It was a nice fresh smell! I immediately took a shower with it. I was surprised at how much lather it made! I heard that natural shampoos are not very good at making lather. So either this shampoo has something in there thats not natural to help with the lather, or they have now perfected making a good lather with natural ingredients. I would like to believe that it is the latter. My hair felt clean after the first wash. It did not make much of a difference to texture yet, but I&#x27;m sure one wash can&#x27;t really make your hair drastically different. I moved to this shampoo from a Dove shampoo, and both seem to have the same effect on the look of my hair at the end. Thats not a bad thing because this shampoo is doing the same thing as my Dove shampoo sans the chemicals! I am a 21 year old guy, and I have really fine hair. So this will be a good experiment for me. I have 3 bottles and have started today. At the end of 1 bottle, I will post here with results, and again at the end of 2 and then at the end of 3! Lets hope it ends well!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, and this shampoo works well for me. I only use products without harsh chemicals and from companies that don&#x27;t do animal testing, so this fits the bill and is not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, I shampoo about every 3 days, other shampoos tend to weigh my hair down and don&#x27;t smell as good either! about once a month or so I&#x27;ll use a pantene shampoo to really strip my hair clean and then I&#x27;ll go back to using the \\&quot;Big Body\\&quot; shampoo. Although I have to say that the absolute best thing for my hair is excersizing, that really makes it look the mostspringy and the least flat.</li>
            <li> While this left my hair feeling clean, and I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals, it did nothing for my baby fine hair. Baby shampoo does the same job. This shampoo actually removed the slight wave in my hair, which I like, and want to encourage.  *****Update: After finishing the bottle, and using it alternating weeks with my usual Pantene shampoo to make a comparison  -- I&#x27;m sold on this product. I recently purchased the companion conditioner and must say I am very pleased with the results. I think the results from using this shampoo improve over time, and I would suggest buying both shampoo and conditioner and sticking with them for a while.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, fine hair of medium thickness, and very oily skin and hair.  A little over a year ago I switched to natural shampoos and tried several kinds of shampoo bars.  Due to hard water and how much hair I have, I had problems with residue, so I had to add a baking soda rinse to every shampoo, and balance it out with a vinegar or citric acid rinse.  I saw Kiss My Face shampoo at the grocery store and got the Whenever variety first.  It smells great and pretty much guaranteed a good hair day for me (with the shampoo bars my hair was rather hit or miss), but one thing I loved about the tea tree bar I was using is that it let me wash my hair every other day instead of every day (with some corn starch before bed).  Whenever wouldn&#x27;t let me skip a day, my hair was just too oily the next morning, so I was using it maybe once a week to help eliminate residue from the shampoo bars.  I decided to try out Big Body to see if it had the same effect, and while I still have a little bit more oil in my hair on the second day (which a little bit better corn starch application before bed can help) than I might prefer, I can use this every other day and not feel like a walking oil slick on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  That&#x27;s a real win for me.  I use the Whenever conditioner on the length of my hair, which reduces tangles.  I tend to not like volumizing shampoo in general, because it tends to make my fly-aways worse without adding real volume (frankly, my hair is too long and heavy for a shampoo to add a ton of volume anyway), but the Whenever conditioner helps with that.  This might be too drying for the length of my (admittedly damaged because I don&#x27;t get it cut often enough) hair without the conditioner, but together, I love my KMF hair!</li>
            <li> No chemicals, goes on easy, washes off well and leaves my hair soft. What else do you want in a shampoo? Wouldn&#x27;t mind if it came in larger sizes, less plastic bottles to dispose of.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I switched from standard shampoo to all-natural shampoo.  It&#x27;s better for my hair and better for the environment, but the brand I was using made my fine hair limp and lifeless - no body at all.  Fast forward to a month ago.  I got a haircut and took 3 inches off my shoulder length hair.  At work, nobody said anything.  They either didn&#x27;t notice or didn&#x27;t want to comment.  Three weeks ago, I started using KMF Big Body shampoo and conditioner.  Just last week, I started getting all kinds of comments about my \\&quot;cute new haircut,\\&quot; which now actually has a personality instead of lying flat against my head.  When a hair product has more of an effect on my hair than lopping off 3 inches, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Love this but it is slightly drying. I use it with the matching conditioner and a leave in conditioner from Acure Organics</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, this Big Body shampoo.  I&#x27;ve looked through the reviews but have not seen anyone mention the reason I chose for trying this out: it has no palm oil.  (If you don&#x27;t know why I seek things that have no palm oil, try a Google search for &amp;#34;palm oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;orangutans.&amp;#34;)  It was a very pleasant surprise to find that this product does everything my previous stuff did, and more.  The best verdict, I guess, is from my wife, who told me, &amp;#34;Well, I guess I&#x27;ll use that, too.  Did you buy enough?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!</li>
            <li> Works good for my fine dry hair.  It does not weight down or dry out my hair.  I would buy again.  I will buy the 16oz bottle next time.  Better buy.</li>
            <li> This is the first organic shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and I am very pleased.  My hair is very fine and can&#x27;t be weighed down with too much product. I&#x27;ve only used it about a week so far but my hair is fuller and feels great.  I am 44 yrs old and color my hair so I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that will be gentle enough to use. I will continue to use it as I see the other reviewers say that the longer you use it the better your hair gets! I also purchased the conditioner and love it as well.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite shampoo. Vey good cleaning without drying out my hair. I checked out the ingredients at the \\&quot;Environment Working Group\\&quot; website and it is also one of the safer shampoos available. I will continue to purchase this shampoo at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this Shampoo along with its complimentary conditioner for my long/ fine textured hair. Unfortunately, this shampoo for me didn&#x27;t give me any noticeable volume improvement. I thought perhaps I hadn&#x27;t tried it long enough to see signs of improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m at the end of the first bottles of shampoo and conditioner (they are each sold in sets of three). The scent of the shampoo and conditioner are identical, but don&#x27;t last too long after the hair is dried. All in all, Big Body Shampoo and Conditioner were nothing more than a Big Disappointment. Save your money, and look for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 3-17-2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearing the middle of my third bottles of the Big Body Shampoo and Conditioner now, I can say that this combo does deliver in shine and softness. If massive body isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re after, then you might want to consider this organic combo. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did do an experiement before starting my third bottles, in which I switched over to Pantene Beautiful Lengths for a day, and WHOA could I tell the difference! My hair during the experiment was stringy and flyaway, nothing like I had grown used to using Big Body by KMF. I figured my experiment really *ticked-off* my hair with all those chemicals, and quickly I went back to Big Body, now my hair is *happy* again; once you use organic hair products, I don&#x27;t think your hair will be happy with the &#x27;same old chemical junk&#x27; readily sold in stores and salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for shine, softness and increased manageability . . . then Big Body is the organic for you. :)</li>
            <li> I used the previous version (in the green bottle) for years and loved it because I have sensitive hair and skin and this kept me clean and intact. The new version has the same name but is in a white bottle and claims \\&quot;now with Argan oil.\\&quot; The oil doesn&#x27;t seem to change much apart than the scent (which I don&#x27;t care for because it&#x27;s strong and to lingers all day) But the big story is the first ingredient is now \\&quot;aqua\\&quot; (that&#x27;s water), and not \\&quot;aloe barbadensis\\&quot; like it was before. This seems to be a tip-off that they&#x27;ve changed the formula to make the product more cost-efficient (so they could afford the Argan oil?). The new formula leaves my hair in knots, making it difficult to comb. My hair went frizzy and had a mind of its own both days I tried this. Worse, when I rinse the product off it gets on my skin and causes irritation unlike anything I&#x27;ve experienced with KMF before. This was the last KMF product I could still use, and sadly I will now be moving on to another brand. If anybody knows of a product that&#x27;s more like what the old Big Body used to be, please leave a comment. Thank you. *edit: also note they&#x27;ve added Green Tea extract to this formula, so if you react poorly to very small doses of caffeine, this may not be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> die produkte ware einwandfrei, weder beschädigt noch sonst etwas: nur daher, das die drei flaschen eingequetscht wurden lief etwas shampoo aus. die verpackung ist also noch zu optimieren.</li>
            <li> Big Body is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for curly hair.  It leaves my hair very soft and fluffy, without any frizz.</li>
            <li> A shampoo that leaves my hair feeling REALLY clean...no leftover residue.  Rinses out quickly also.  Used wth KMF conditionder, a great combition to great feeling and looking hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the shampoo gets more foamy than other natural products but I tend to have greasy hair and find that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it stays clean for a prolonged time.  I used up one bottle of the shampoo and by the time I was halfway through the second one, I wanted to switch shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;While the product itself is ok, I feel like 3 bottles is too much. I will say that I have never been really impressed with any natural shampoos though. I would prefer to go back to buying the shampoo and conditioner at Trader Joes.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of this shampoo (as I did with the matching conditioner). My scalp tend to get greasy, even though I dont put any product in typically, and I went through this too fast.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a lovely peppermint smell. I use it with the Kiss My Face &amp;#34;Mistreated&amp;#34; conditioner. I have bleached blonde hair and this combo is perfect for me. The Argan oil in the product seems to make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as well as several other organic brands and several of the different types that KMF makes. While it does lather better than other organic brands, I always notice a big difference when I use someone else&#x27;s non-organic shampoo or products at a hotel, etc. Obviously it&#x27;s not too bad because I&#x27;ve stuck with it. I find I get a slightly better lather if I freshly wet my hair a few seconds before applying, or apply, wet again quickly, and then lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long color-treated fine hair and I do think that KMF big body does do a good job of not weighing down my hair- it&#x27;s the best flavor for me. My husband has short very curly hair and I don&#x27;t think he notices a difference between the KMF types but I definitely do.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and this shampoo gives it some nice body, plus it smells nice. The only thing that I wish is that I could find this in the 32-OUNCE SIZE WITH A PUMP DISPENSER!!</li>
            <li> I like the tablespoon of baking soda and 1 cup water shampoo, but this is so much nicer with the same real, real clean effect. This brand is one of my favorites. Need to try the conditioner next.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite shampoo.  I had been searching for something like this that left hair clean and gave it body.  All I can say is I am very impressed and I even got some compliments that my hair looks better after using it.  I have thinning hair, and although you can not change that, this product makes it look thicker and fuller.  It has a neutral smell too, nothing noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after looking it up on www.ewg.org/skindeep.  I like it and have ordered more.  My hair is straight, short, and limp.  This shampoo works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims. This shampoo adds volume and shine and also suds without sulphates! It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect shampoo for my hair!  Have been using it for a couple of years now.  On a whim I checked to see if Amazon offered it and glad I did - great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I actually like a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo (this is my second time buying it). I have long, fine curly/wavy hair and I like the feel of it after washing it with this shampoo. It does take a generous portion of the product to make foam, but it leaves your hair feeling clean and not coarse and even though the shampoo is meant to add volume, it doesn&#x27;t make the hair frizzy or weird, just nice. My scalp feels a bit more oily than usual, but not uncomfortable or dirty, and my hair feels and looks healthier (and shinier) overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is... well, you guessed it, the price. I wish it was less pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it strips the hair of all it&#x27;s moisture.  it creates body, but my hair gets dried out and doesn&#x27;t move.  even if i use a moisturizing conditioner after this, my hair is still dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This product is great for body, volumizing, and shine and one I faithful return to, even take to hair salon on occasion when I get a hair cut.  Product was properly packaged and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to add volume to my hair AND it does make it softer.  Am a little concerned that this product contains Panthenol, which I believe is a chemical.  Other than that, I would love it.</li>
