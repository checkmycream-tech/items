            <li>also Go with the grain, and then against for best results.</li>
            <li>Best blade I have ever used !!</li>
            <li>I threw the Merkur blade away and put in a Shark blade and got a wonderful shave.  </li>
            <li>I suppose there&#x27;s no one best blade for everyone, but these do not give me the best shave.</li>
            <li>I just feel these are not the best for me.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;d recommend that anyone who uses a double-edge razor to try a variety of blades and stick with what works best for that user.  </li>
            <li>I use the Merkur 34C and they go great together!</li>
            <li>These give me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Well, I shaved with these Shark Blades today and I can say without a shadow of a doubt, that these Shark Razor blades are the best blades I have ever used.</li>

            <li>Best and cheapest option for close shaves.</li>
            <li>I admit that I have never tried the legendary Feather blades</li>
            <li>Best price on razors, which give a closer shave than all the 3 and 4 blade versions on the market today.  </li>
            <li>, although I don&#x27;t think buying it on Amazon is the best way to go.  </li>

            <li>Great price as well.</li>
            <li>Great razers.</li>
            <li>BTW you get like 10 great shaves with this razer</li>
            <li>Sharks are great.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>These razors were a great buy good quality and for a great price.</li>
            <li>Have a nice day !</li>
            <li>Good beginner and experienced DE shaver blade.</li>
            <li>Good shave with these blades, great price</li>
            <li>These blades I have found to be more than acceptable and give me excellent service of 5 to 7 days before having to replace them.  </li>
            <li>these blades are perfect and I love using them on my head as well as they are forgiving.  </li>
            <li>I tried Astra and like them better, but they are both excellent and affordable.</li>
            <li>So, to each his own!</li>
            <li>I shave my head and face, so it works out to be an amazing value and a great shave every time.    </li>
            <li>Many said they where the perfect balance of sharpness and quality, and they provided an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>Good razors.</li>
            <li>My husband said they gave him a superior shave to the Merkur blades that came with his safety razor and they cost a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Great deal for the money, and nice to have a supply fo a while.</li>
            <li>Good balance of sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li>Smooth and no nicks great!</li>
            <li>Buy a good one.</li>
            <li>They are good blades.</li>
            <li>That being said with the 100 pack i should be good for quite a while.</li>
            <li>These razors, in conjunction with a good safety razor and some Colonel Conk&#x27;s Shaving Cream and a Mr. Tweezerman&#x27;s badger-hair shave brush, I am in shaving heaven.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades feathers, derbys, personas, merkur, and I&#x27;ve found good ones but for the price</li>
            <li>Thus, the Chrome gives a superior or smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>Good price for good blade</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>ASTRA PLATIMUM( good),</li>
            <li>If you take your time these are superior in my experience.</li>
            <li>Good product and I like how they are packaged.  </li>
            <li>hey, its a heckuva good value.</li>
            <li>this a good bladed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with the Astra Superior Platinum blades.</li>
            <li>For the price they are a good deal</li>
            <li>Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for about five shaves each.</li>
            <li>A blade is good for 2-4 shaves.</li>
            <li>I had a good lather</li>
            <li>Some get a good shave with these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting a good, close shave with these.</li>
            <li>I can get a close 2-3 shaves, but there&#x27;s a good amount of irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>Can you get a good shave with this blade?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>Cheap and cuts great!</li>
            <li>These seem to do quite a good job.</li>
            <li>Shark Chrome razors  are good but not as good as Feather or Astra.</li>
            <li>But these blades aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>, good thing I have a hundred of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades consistantly keep a good edge for seven shave days.</li>
            <li>I started shaving with these blades, and they do a good job of it.  </li>
            <li>A good beginner blade.</li>
            <li>Get the 100 pack w/ free shipping for best value.</li>
            <li>Awesome blades...forgiving and cheap (can get them for under .10/blade if you buy it in volume).  </li>
            <li>Good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these blades a couple of times already, and plan on keeping a good stock on hand...</li>
            <li>Each blade good for 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>These blades are good for one shave....</li>
            <li>Seem like good quality.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Feather blades I purchased.</li>
            <li>to be fair I tested them both in my Merkur Adjustable and also in a Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item was received sooner than I anticipated, surprising me with it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li>These are good blades and bought a load of them.</li>
            <li>They are not the sharpest, but are also fairly forgiving in terms of shaving technique and kept the razor burn under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>4 good shaves</li>
            <li>Good blades.</li>
            <li>For those that use this style of razor as opposed to the kind with 2-8 blades in them, these are excellent, cheap, and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Feather (exceptional, but expensive)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>was very satisfied with the Shark blades.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad that I read the reviews for these blades, for 17cents a piece I&#x27;m jumping for joy over here.  </li>
            <li>Works great and cheap!</li>
            <li>Bought him the shaving soap with bowl and soap brush, he&#x27;s much happy using these - he says it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all :-)</li>
            <li>With this in mind, I will say that this is a great razor, but I have found better.</li>
            <li>for me this was the first blade i tried and was the best.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think you can find any better that Shark Blades!</li>
            <li>you get a better shave!</li>
            <li>Glad I made the change!</li>
            <li>but those are so pricey that it negates one of the best arguments for DE shaving..namely the large cost saving.</li>
            <li>Large amount but perfect!!</li>
            <li>The quality of shave with these blades is truly amazing.   </li>
            <li>I have to start by saying that for me this blade provides an amazing close shave</li>
            <li>So anyone want about 45 Shark Blades for free, lol.  </li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, amazing, amazing</li>
            <li>these things are amazing.</li>
            <li>I get a nice shave, and they each blade lasts for 2-3 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Just let the blade glide over your face under its own weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>own an Edwin Jagger DE 89.  </li>
            <li>There are plenty of blades, nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have not had a closer shave with any of the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; brand name razors.</li>
            <li>My hubby loves how it gives a nice close shave every morning, he gave up on disposable razors and his cordless/corded shaver.</li>
            <li>They do a good job, and I think they are better than just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>These are nice blades, quality edges that seem to hold up well.</li>
            <li>tried them in was a feather popular</li>
            <li>I bought myself a safety razor---you know, the kind your dad or grandpa used.  </li>
            <li>I like these razors but to each his/her own.  </li>
            <li>The bulk pack is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>but I think there are more suitable matches!</li>
            <li>The fact that they are so cheap makes them even more attractive.    </li>
            <li>bought these through Amazon, the packaged arrived quickly, packaged well and am quite happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shark Super Chrome blades for over a year now and have had great results with these blades.</li>
            <li>They nick and cut very easily.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased!</li>
            <li>A very good bargain, and an absolute steal compared to your store bought blades</li>
            <li>It honestly take more than 3 passes for me</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think because it&#x27;s cheap that it can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Shark blades for nearly 2 years and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m still a very happy \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; DE razor user.  </li>
            <li>so far these razors are working great!</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers, I ran my own tests with razors in my price range.  </li>
            <li>They were by far the best, smoothest, and sharpest.</li>
            <li>but so far I am very happy with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And by far the best blades by Lord.</li>
            <li>These blades are best so far.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get a great shave out of them in my more mild razors like the Merkur HD.  </li>
            <li>If money is tight, I would try one or two sample packs to get an idea of what works best, but you should try 5 - 10 blades, in my opinion, to get the best feel over time for what is going to give you the most comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a great shave that is in my opinion better then a derby and cheaper then one too, then get these, try them out i am very sure that you will like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li>Now I have a supply of good blade at a very good price that will last years!</li>
            <li>I just got done with my first shave using the sharks and my skin feels great</li>
            <li>: Go out and buy these unless you really need the best of the best (really course, fast growing</li>
            <li>you can not beat the price, even if you changed the blade for every shave, you get a close shave, they leave your face very smooth</li>
            <li>the blade tugged and pulled and didn&#x27;t leave me with a very smooth face I will have to shave with another blade</li>
            <li>SHAVE IS VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on to my quest for a blade that suits me better.</li>
            <li>I had a better experience with the Astra Platinum that came as a sample pack with the razor or</li>
            <li>It takes me more than one pass to get all the stubble.</li>
            <li>I got these in bulk before trying them out, and I&#x27;m still glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If I did my part, then, the shaving experience was never horrible... just not optimal.  </li>
            <li>I had so many knicks and cuts in my face</li>
            <li>you like them buy them two packs at a time with free shipping!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you save money when getting this rather than the blades that I use to get.</li>
            <li>I seems to be more prone to nicks with this razor compared to others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The wilkinson sword blades at wallmart are way better than these.</li>
            <li>The feather has an unforgiving feel to it, and the shark allows me to be able to repeat pass problem areas without worrying about cuts.  </li>
            <li>doing some more research here on Amazon and The Badger &amp; Blade website, I found a lot of people where recommending these Shark Razor Blades.</li>
            <li>I have been able to shave with one blade from Monday to Sunday, changing the blade each Sunday after shaving.  </li>
            <li>There may be better razors out there</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and i love them.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I have 97 more to go...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more blades.</li>
            <li>For better blades consider the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it will be a while before i need to buy more.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I maybe getting more than a week out of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would.  </li>
            <li>But I found that if I take my time and use the shave soap, I get a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li>These blades are ok.  </li>
            <li>two thumbs up and my recommendation to buy them! :)</li>
            <li>I bought these razor blades along with an awesome razor and I am so glad I will never have to go back to disposable razors again.</li>
            <li>Plus you get so many at once</li>
            <li>(I love how many come in</li>
            <li>I use them in my Merkur and like them much better than the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>listen to what many reviewers have said that you should not</li>
            <li>PolSilver ( got the biggest knick on this one, more my fault not the blades</li>
            <li>Better razors do exist out there</li>
            <li>These are my favorite DE blades.</li>
            <li>I have a Merkur razor that I have tried to use these on as they are more inexpensive than Merkur&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sharks as part of a sampler and glad now that I did.</li>
            <li>so the blades leave a nice smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>So cheap!</li>
            <li>The top of that list being the Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Of the three, these are the sharpest, and the most uniform in quality.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more when this pack runs out.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite at this price.</li>
            <li>Better than the cartridges.</li>
            <li>Safe shave.</li>
            <li>It is what it say it is, a freakin ton of razors i dont know why i bought so many.</li>
            <li>Make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing with the razor before you blame all the nicks and cuts on the blade.    </li>
            <li>After figuring out how to use the razor, I bought an alum block and a blade sampler to see if there were better blades out there.</li>
            <li>Is it better than a cartridge razor?</li>
            <li>You better believe it.</li>
            <li>I have found that BIC and Feather blades work best for my face compared to Shark, Derby, Merkur, and Red Personna.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these when I use them up.</li>
            <li>I like the Derby blades,  but love these.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>It makes me laugh that 3. 4, 5, track razors even sell- because you cannot get a closer or better shave with a good safety razor</li>
            <li>and I had whipped up a good lather on a freshly washed  face  </li>
            <li>My husband just love the feel of this blade.</li>
            <li>THE QUALITY OF THE BADES IS OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>pleased with this product as well.</li>
            <li>But these Sharks stood at the top for me,</li>
            <li>Has more blades</li>
            <li>My best suggestion is to find a sample pack of various types of razors.</li>
            <li>Most blades come in cardboard.  </li>
            <li>These things are cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>shark brand is ok</li>
            <li>Pleased with the DE razor replacements.  </li>
            <li>I found out the blades were CHEAP!  </li>
            <li>Even better, I get a closer shave with this blade than with the newest Gillette creation.  </li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave everytime.</li>
            <li>Better shave too</li>
            <li>I have tried five different brands of blades, and these have performed the best.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but I find that Personna blades work better with my razors.</li>
            <li>So for the most part i&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>They seem to cause a bit more irritation than others as well.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been satisfied with them, but the bulk discount of these razors had him sold.  </li>
            <li>Sample before buying too many.</li>
            <li>, these still cut OK</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use a blade more than 4 times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double-edged safety razor for over a year now and feel competent to rate these.  </li>
            <li>They turned out to be better than the Merkur blades</li>
            <li>Love these blades.  </li>
            <li>love this blades.</li>
            <li>have had much better experience with Merkur Blades.</li>
            <li>I have a lifetime supply of razors now :)</li>
            <li>I love this razor and my skin does as well</li>
            <li>And it is a much better shave.</li>
            <li>gonna try the Israeli Personna&#x27;s next time, I hear good things!!!</li>
            <li>I wish I did not buy so many.  </li>
            <li>and I get more irritation from using these.  </li>
            <li>but I wish I would have tried these before buying so many.</li>
            <li>Add for more words</li>
            <li>I use them primarily to shave my legs, but I get a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>For a smooth and close shave, these are the best I found so far.</li>
            <li>Okay product for the price</li>
            <li>Depending on how course your beard is you may be able to get 3 or 4 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>My favorite blade to pair with my parker razor.</li>
            <li>More so than even Feather blades.</li>
            <li>I gave the rest of the pack to my brother in-law and he seems to love them.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice close and clean shave, these are the shaver blades I recommend that you use on your face.</li>
            <li>Shark provides a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Blades shave nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it with my safety razor and it provides a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Be kind to your skin, that&#x27;s the reason we started shaving this way right!?</li>
            <li>That being said I&#x27;d strongly recommend to all that you buy a sampler pack of different brands (there are some here on amazon) and see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li>The work pretty good</li>
            <li>However these blades work pretty good for my face</li>
            <li>This type of shaving device has a long and excellent record all over the world.</li>
            <li>This equates into some blades giving up to 3 acceptable shaves with the first being really good.  </li>
            <li>When I first got my safety razor, I made the wise decision of buying a variety pack before buying anything in bulk.</li>
            <li>WIth any safety razor use a good quality shaving soap like Taylors or Prorasor and use hot water to rise face before lather and during shave to rinse blade.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>They are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>You may be able to find higher quality blades than Super Chromes, but these give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought these with my new shaver and they work great together.  </li>
            <li>Both myself and the wife liked the Shark Super Chromes, so I decided to order a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li>nice feature of the super chromes is the plastic case that they come in.  </li>
            <li>Dorco (wonderful blades, won&#x27;t give the closest shave but very forgiving, also very economical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have not had this smooth a shave in many many</li>
            <li>Awesome buy, razors are sharp, split the order with some family members got a few of them to switch to safety razors, win win for everyone :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they ae just fine.</li>
            <li>But the Shark blades certainly are a good price.  </li>
            <li>I have had somewhat better luck with disposables versus electrics and have tried all the latest and greatest disposables right up to the versions that are currently offered.  </li>
            <li>That said, these are very good value overall.</li>
            <li>Badger and blade has a wealth of information available including a long list of reviews and an excellent community of knowledgeable shavers.</li>
            <li>If you have skin that is sensitive to shaper blades, these would be great for you.</li>
            <li>These blades are great and are good for up to 5 shaves per week if you take care to clean and dry them.    </li>
            <li>but I seemed to get a cut and rash free shave with these more often than not.</li>
            <li>Wow, that was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who prefer wet shaves.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and will allow you to have a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and these blades have a good edge on them.</li>
            <li>but honestly at $12 it was worth the risk for me.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are such a good deal!</li>
            <li>Perfect. Stayed sharp for 3-4 used</li>
            <li>but it is fairly easy to wipe away.</li>
            <li>They arrived in 20-5 blade packs, so it was easy to throw some in my dopp kit and some at my girlfriend&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li>They come packaged in boxes of 10 and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you want a close, easy, shave around your chin and below your nose, try something else.</li>
            <li>Easy then to dispense a blade, or to slide used blades into the box for disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still fault the manufacturer because there are no instructions to determine this \\&quot;easy open\\&quot; feature, but it is there.</li>
            <li>While blades vary from user to user, these really have been the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>easy to cut yourself with</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret my decision to buy these in bulk because they represent a fair ripper of a deal and give a decently close shave.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!hey where as good as people said they where.</li>
            <li>They are durable, sharp and fit perfectly into my safety razor.</li>
            <li>Four words: Hot Knife, Warm Butter.</li>
            <li>great razors nice and sharp</li>
            <li>To be fair the competition ended up pretty much neck to neck but with the Feathers at $32/100 and giving me 2 good shaves (head and face), the Silver Blue&#x27;s at $23/100 with 2 good shaves, and the Sharks at $12/100 with</li>
            <li>These razors are very sharp and using them with my butterfly safety razor is perfect for sculting my beard.  </li>
            <li>It will easily pay for itself, because these blades are so cheap.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but the grain of my beard is funky around my chin.</li>
            <li>it is more consistent albeit more expensive/wasteful.</li>
            <li>I do my best in other areas to be economical/eco friendly</li>
            <li>Working just fine in my Weber Bulldog DE.</li>
            <li>Still, they work fine.</li>
            <li>These blades seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>Also this blades needs a very light touch and best to go slow with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could be a little sharper but all and all one of the best blades I have used.</li>
            <li>These little guys work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Huge difference in weight and feel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t knock this product at all, its a HUGE value at 11 bucks for 100 blades.</li>
            <li>The shaves are close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Great blades, though I probably should have tried a smaller package.</li>
            <li>I went back to them and have had great shaves ever since.</li>
            <li>These blades cut smoothly for three to five days, which is all I ask.</li>
            <li>These shark blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I get the same great shave using one blade vs three.</li>
            <li>My face has not been this smooth since I was a baby.</li>
            <li>My face has not been this smooth since I was a baby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Sharks give me about 3-5 shaves per razor and cut fairly smooth up to that.  </li>
            <li>Personna (fantastic blades, made in the US if that matters to you)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>The blades are a great value and will last me for years.</li>
            <li>the price is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>Pick these up with a safety razor and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li>This is a great double edge razor blade.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and for me, has eleimiated any razor burn/bumps under my neck.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy the 100 count because I liked them so much.</li>
            <li>and you will enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I change them out every week (3 shaves), just because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Great blades, way cheaper to use a double edge safety blade razor than buying the junk at walmart.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light growth</li>
            <li>Before you buy a ton of any razors, buy just a few to see which one you like the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually I didn&#x27;t order them but they came free with a razor I just bought from Amazon</li>
            <li>really smooth shave</li>
            <li>Gives a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>do not give a smooth shave on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replace blade every few shaves for best result.</li>
            <li>If you need a smooth, close shave, these are your blades.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how smooth and comfortable</li>
            <li>Blades aren&#x27;t as readily available as they used to be, but they seem to be making a comeback.  </li>
            <li>I have moved on to Wilkinson Sword blades that are much better and giving me a good shave regularly 4-5 times per blade.</li>
            <li>The shave, however, is nowhere near as good as Astra.</li>
            <li>At a price of $17.50 for 100 I find that a yearly cost in blades, (assuming you are changing blades every five days), of $12.78 to be far superior to the replacement cost of the newer shaving gimmicks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I think there a very good and sharp blade</li>
            <li>I get no cutting of my skin, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just didn&#x27;t work, For me these work perfect.</li>
            <li>-maybe there are other blades that are great and maybe even better-</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stay sharp for more than 3 shaves, but great deal for the price</li>
            <li>The shave per blade count is very economical too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 years now and very rarely cut myself.</li>
            <li>You just have to try several and find what works best for your particular beard/skin type.</li>
            <li>Excellent blades that give me a clean and crisp shave with a single pass.  </li>
            <li>Shark super chrome razor blades give me a close and comfortable shave with no razor burn and one blade will last a full week which makes them a great value also.</li>
            <li>At first I was amazed how much better my shaves where with the Merkur Razor Blades, but after awhile I noticed I was not getting as close a shave as I would like with them.</li>
            <li>A years worth of razors for 11 bucks!  </li>
            <li>Generally I shave 6 times a week and get a good shave each time.</li>
            <li>the blades are very good quality and rather inexpensive, these blades all 100 of them will last me atleast 2 years for 16$ plus shipping which wasnt much.</li>
            <li>They gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using straight razor for two years now, I love feather razors but gave these a whirl as the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different razor blades and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>For the relative price of this blade compared to the rest, this blade, in my opinion, was by far the best of the pack.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are careful you can get a good shave with them but for the value maybe Astra or Lords are really a &#x27;better bargain&#x27; for the number of quality shaves that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stainless steel are rougher and the chrome give a cleaner, closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The Shark Super Chromes are the smoothest of three being completely free of razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>Super close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Great razors, nice compact packaging which allows you to distribute the razors slowly as you need them.</li>
            <li>The Shark Super Chrome work best for me, but make sure you try a sample of different blades before buying a larger pack.</li>
            <li>The true mettle of any blade is tested ATG, this is where these Sharks perform significantly below par.  </li>
            <li>They are still a good blade and better than some other&#x27;s I have tried, but, some blades are noticeably sharper than others.  </li>
            <li>That is, when the blade is new and for about 3 uses afterwards I can get excellent results with a single pass.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried many others - so some might be better, but these are low cost and work fine.</li>
            <li>These blades are decent but are certainly not the best for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this already great quality bundle of blades when there was a small sale, making it an even better value.  </li>
            <li>The Shark blades provide a great shave without drag...</li>
            <li>Good razors especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Solid, good valued blade.</li>
            <li>but you can only get about 2 good shaves with them</li>
            <li>However I noticed that I cut myself much more often with the Feather Razor Blades then with the Merkur Blades, and that I had very irritated skin after shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li>You need at least 5-10 trials before getting the best out of a blade.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with medium weight facial hair....</li>
            <li>Get yourself a good quality safety razor and buy a supply of these Shark Double Edge blades.  </li>
            <li>purchased these again because I loved them so much last time.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, and these blades hold up well for at least 3-5 shaves.  </li>
            <li>These blades are economical and give him a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>but good enough for the amount and cost.</li>
            <li>These blades give a good shave at a low price.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Rob:)</li>
            <li>and I use Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades</li>
            <li>I will be switching back to Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li>a good del and a solid brand.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really say how many shaves I can get from one blade yet but regardless, these are going to save me a lot of money over the cartridge blade alternative.</li>
            <li>You may get more shaves, but really at this price I am not worried about it.</li>
            <li>Buying the blades in 100 count really makes shaving so much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Really cool retro look.</li>
            <li>Way better than the Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li>I can shave a full month on one blade.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li>In all, the Super Chromes last for about 2 really good close shaves and take off almost everything.  </li>
            <li>These blades came with the razor and I had forgotten how easy and nice it is to shave with an ACTUAL razor.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and smooth, my best results so far</li>
            <li>the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong, of course you can always buy a SAMPLER first to see which blades you liked best.</li>
            <li>extremely sharp DE blades, that will give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;no irritation, no bumps,</li>
            <li>They are great for learning since they aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as the Feather blades I now prefer.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell a big difference between these and the super stainless, they both work great.</li>
            <li>The Shark razor blades represent a tremendous value.  </li>
            <li>I soon switched to Astra which felt a lot smoother and reduced my razor burn tremendously</li>
            <li>I was given a 5 pack of shark super chrome and a Merkur 180 aka 23c by a friend.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>They are of much higher and more consistent quality then the Merkur Razor Blades.</li>
            <li>They are of much higher and more consistent quality then the Merkur Razor Blades.</li>
            <li>The Super Chromes man-handle through the close/stubborn matter.  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and well.....</li>
            <li>The Shark blades did a great job, and I mention all of this only so that you&#x27;ll realize that I really have not had anything to compare these blades to yet.  </li>
            <li>I found that they dulled too quickly though.  </li>
            <li>These Shark Super Chromes at the time didn&#x27;t catch my attention</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll average 2-3 full face shaves on a razor which I believe is great considering the cost of these.</li>
            <li>Unscientifically, I tried about 5 brands in a sampler pack before settling on Shark Super Chrome.</li>
            <li>Because for the same price or maybe a dollar more per 100  you can get Astra which is a better blade.</li>
            <li>I get eight shave from each Shark Super Chrome blade.</li>
            <li>I had no nicks or irritation whatsoever with the Shark  Super Chrome blades.  </li>
            <li>I have found my blade, the Shark Super Chrome.  </li>
            <li>Very good value for very little money.</li>
            <li>No actually that isn&#x27;t exactly true, they are more comfortable and irritation free than the Derbys.</li>
            <li>Sharp and very nice.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Likes - everything, the blades sit nicely into the razor and is sharp through many shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendations - to anyone who wants a close shave that has hair like mine which is very course, although i am sure that anyone could with any type of hair would find them comfortable.</li>
            <li>Not as good as in the old days of using double edged blades, I don&#x27;t get as many shaves as I did with Gillette.</li>
            <li>Great blades for less than some of the more highly touted brands.</li>
            <li>Great sharp blade, will buy again!</li>
            <li>know its a &#x27;Straight razor&#x27; trick but believe me it really helps to take a good hot towel and stream your face first before you shave.....</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are very sharp and they perform great.</li>
            <li>This blade is great for the beginner DE shaver, very sharp and gives you closest shave you have ever experienced compared to a store bought, five blade, typical brand name razor.  </li>
            <li>as I really was not sure which blade would work best for</li>
            <li>The second shave was just as good as the first, in terms of sharpness.</li>
            <li>If you miss a day and have extra long stubble to shave, well, best of luck hacking away at it.</li>
            <li>To me, a fresh Shark Super Chrome feels like a Feather on day three.  </li>
            <li>As said, these are good single use blades for the price.</li>
            <li>My husband like his razer and shaving cream, It cut very close just what he wanted!!</li>
            <li>It is a lot more cost effective when you can buy 100 blades for less than 8 of the multi-blade razor blade.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, very nice.</li>
            <li>At the price Shark charges, he&#x27;s more than happy to swap in new blades after only 2 shaves to ensure that each shave has a nearly pristine blade.</li>
            <li>In fact, this changed my shaving experience from one of purely mechanical perfunctory actions, to one where I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, as I do think these blades are OK (for me) and they certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.ey certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.</li>
            <li>They work great for my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>It is very well balanced and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It gives a VERY forgiving and SMOOTH</li>
            <li>They are amazing and give a closer shave than what I used to get with my Mach III and its multiple blades.</li>
            <li>Only having 5 in a pack and not 10 is kind of a nuisance.</li>
            <li>On top of that I also have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>Ordered a mixed bag of razors to test out the kinds I liked.</li>
            <li>In my opinion these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Favorite so far.</li>
            <li>As far as durability, don&#x27;t expect more than 2-3 shaves, with</li>
            <li>The 7AM&#x27;s will last for 3-4 nice shaves considering that you will feel that the shave isn&#x27;t the smoothest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two combined are so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Two years worth of razors for ~17 bucks can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>These blades are so much better than my old Fusion cartridges.</li>
            <li>I like them and feel it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the rest of these blades to get my money&#x27;s worth and then probably never buy them again.    </li>
            <li>I start Monday with a nice fresh balde and can get a weeks worth of facial shaving out of it.  </li>
            <li>Thats a years worth of shaving for $15.</li>
            <li>Figured id give these a shot and for 15 dollars if i liked them i was set, if not, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>This was by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get a nick.</li>
            <li>I bought a 100 pack for 11.95 that would be 8.5 years worth of blades compared to a one month supply of the cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li>But at 15 cents a blade, I have no problem putting in a fresh blade after a weeks use.  </li>
            <li>Blade was sharp and fit nicely in razor.</li>
            <li>Nice blades, not as smooth as the Wilkinson Sword, but sharp as SH*T, you&#x27;ll get 4-5 shaves from each one.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think they&#x27;re better than most other brands, even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, as I said, I don&#x27;t have much to compare these to, but I can certainly imagine that some of the higher rated blades, maybe Feather or even Derby, might be better blades in some way.  </li>
            <li>sure to open the razor and clean the blade after every use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using both the Shark Super Chrome and the Shark Super Stainless blades for about a month now.</li>
            <li>Such a better way to get a close clean shave</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel the Shark razors are as sharp as Feathers, and for me, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Quality product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to have some sort of coating which gives a much&lt;br /&gt;smoother shave than other blades I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d probably be just as good for any other razor.</li>
            <li>Other than that these are a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good, sharp razors.  </li>
            <li>To be fair the other two are right there with the Sharks but the Sharks edge them out by a noticeable and not insignificant margin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get right to the nub of it:  </li>
            <li>where right on the money.  </li>
            <li>All of the rave reviews on these blades where right on the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Loving the cost to use ratio right now.</li>
            <li>the guide is right for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>got to find the right match of blade and razor.  </li>
            <li>but right now it looks like the Sharks are going to be the winners.</li>
            <li>I probably should have ordered a sampler pack of many different brand blades in the beginning, but I have been fortunate enough to find these and they give me a smooth comfortable shave, no nicks and no bumps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Variety pack and the first blades I tried out where these Shark Razor Blades, as I was really curious if they where as good as people said they where.</li>
            <li>I was aware of these products but didn&#x27;t buy them because I felt at ten bucks each, they were not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as good as the Shark Super Stainless in my opinion but those seem harder to find in bulk.</li>
            <li>The positive thing I can say that is far more economical to be shaving with this type of blade versus the mach type systems</li>
            <li>After about a week of use i switched back to Gillette 7 o&#x27;clocks because these just seemed to only give me one maybe two good shaves before i had to swap it out, as to where the Gillettes, i regularly get four to five good shaves.  </li>
            <li>New to the world of double edge razor shaving, I think these have been a good blade to start with.</li>
            <li>The two products are in the same class, but these Super Chromes have significantly better reviews.  </li>
            <li>Pretty economical if I do say so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember that pre-shave prep and good technique go a long way in making a particular blade / razor combo work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: If you have coarse hair and rough skin then, the Super Chromes will cost slightly more over time, but will provide a more consistently smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>a white dude with fair complexion and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean and seem to last along time.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m happy and a 100 blades will last me over a year for only $11.00-</li>
            <li>I prefer the super chrome over stainless but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>The cost of these, particularly in bulk, is very attractive, especially against the cartridge razors so widely sold today.  </li>
            <li>Chrome blades come in a plastic container of five blades while the Super Stainless come in a paper container of five blades.</li>
            <li>And yes, I am an experienced wet shaver, use pre-shave oil, Taylor of Old Bond cream, etc.  </li>
            <li>After you get past the break in period these blades will give you many smooth, close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>I admire the purists that go that route, and in a way, it appeals to me, but there is a very real risk, no matter what anyone says, which is why my razor is called a \\&quot;safety razor\\</li>
            <li>Very well made sharp, like through case good when you travel.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints at all, and would strongly recommend them to anyone who has no previous experience with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>With little effort I learned to use the handle and these razors and get a shave as good as any I got from the triple blade name brand razor</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I found these to be relatively scratchy, blade after blade, they worked adequately if I did my part to make sure my beard was as friendly as possible by using very hot water and a quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I think this blade gives the most comfortable and clean shave of any I have used in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I&#x27;m very happy with these blades (my only other experience is with Wilkinson brand).</li>
            <li>Even with a clean blade, proraso sensitive skin cream right out of a hot shower i would get tugging followed by irritation</li>
            <li>About a week after my first DE shave</li>
            <li>the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first type of blade I tried were the Derby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I find these blades to be consistently scratchy.  </li>
            <li>I started using an old-fashioned safety razor to get away from modern, multi-blade razors that are mainly useful to the bank accounts of ad people and manufacturers.</li>
            <li>But They shaved better than german blades.</li>
            <li>Love them, will be shaving with these well into next year.</li>
            <li>With these blades, however, I am able to get a solid 2 pass shave that is quite close with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li>And by friday my face is pretty irritated from using them 5 days in a row.    </li>
            <li>They hold up pretty consistent during that time period.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t fret if the first time you try a blade you don&#x27;t get the results you expect.  </li>
            <li>Blades can be pretty hit and miss.</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love it.\\&quot;  Simply put, I just don&#x27;t have that lovin&#x27; feeling for these blades.  </li>
            <li>They shave as well as or better than the muti-blade razors and 100 Shark blades will last you for years.  </li>
            <li>I am able to get between 5 and 7 double shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li>First shave and everything was as advertised and it worked well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;i will be the first to say.</li>
            <li>I actually use these for razoring and touching up my hair.</li>
            <li>It has consistent quality.</li>
            <li>Well, this is my first Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>The blade actually works better after a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought 100 count, so these are gonna last me 50 months :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pack will last me 2 or so years then I will buy more again.</li>
            <li>Blades were shipped on time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>much better and cheaper than regular plastic rarzor shave!&lt;br /&gt;ill</li>
            <li>Having relied on others&#x27; reviews and safety razor shaving forums, I purchased these as my first refills.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference in shaving smoothness compared to the one razor blade that was included with my safety razor when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>For the first time my head looks like well shake bait</li>
            <li>I have been using single-blade safety razors for just over 2 years and have tried many different blades.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I first started using my Parker 82r with these blades because they come with the razor.</li>
            <li>All the brands I&#x27;ve tried are OK if you use the proper shaving form.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with any razor of any type in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>After trying several of the better razors out there I chose these Sharks.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; for your first pack.  </li>
            <li>The Shark blades feel like a higher quality metal than the Astras</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m assuming that you have tried these blades and others and decided that this is the brand and style for your mug.</li>
            <li>These blades have given me my first razor burn since I started shaving with a safety razor two years ago.</li>
            <li>Maybe the difference in the slightly higher price of the Chrome is the container, because for the life of me I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the shave efficiency or comfort --</li>
            <li>They seem to be shaving me OK.This the first time i ever used this type of razor blade.</li>
            <li>I just started shaving with a DE safety razor and this is my first set of blades</li>
            <li>The amazing part is that these blades actually last longer and give me as close and comfortable a shave as any I was getting with my former device.</li>
            <li>The Sharks have been my favorite blade since I have started using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>These blades for me, won&#x27;t last more than two shaves</li>
            <li>I tried 10-15 different blades before deciding on these, and I have been extremely satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li>These are not my favorite from the company, but still a very solid blade.</li>
            <li>Great price for long lasting blades.  </li>
            <li>My favorite 3, the ones in the running for a bulk (50-100) purchase are the Feathers, Gillette Silver Blue, and these.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I always get a better shave the second time around.</li>
            <li>I personally will not use the blade for more than 2 shaves.</li>
            <li>No point, these are better, last longer, and to me</li>
            <li>Meets my expectations and adequately replaces a Gillette Double Edge Razor that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>The third shave on this blade was worthless for me; Slicing up my face something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend these blades as a great product and a great buy, but they are so cheap; don&#x27;t sacrifice your face trying to maximize the life of your blades.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you&#x27;ll get an amazing blade, other times it will chew your face</li>
            <li>I can get a whole 3 pass shave in the second time, but need to keep re-wetting my face, much more than I do on the first shave.  </li>
            <li>nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I love these blades in my more aggressive DE razors and the price point is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a good deal and gave me the opportunity to try several different blades.</li>
            <li>So far I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased with the shave these provide.  </li>
            <li>Always gives a great clean shave, be VERY careful when first using them they will slice you with little effort on a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>I shaved with Derby for about two years because I got a large pack without trying them first.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where all these positive reviews come</li>
            <li>They get dull really fast better off  buying blades from dollar store 10 times better</li>
            <li>, I got two years worth of shaves, assuming more or less 1 blade a week--some weeks maybe missing a shave ortwo, or taking good care of a blade</li>
            <li>They are menthol eucolyptus based and give your face a very cool refreshing feeling that last long after your shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got enough to last me quite awhile, so I&#x27;m glad that they give a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>pretty much got it done in 2 passes, even though I stuck with three.  </li>
            <li>I have used that for the past year and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used disposable razors in the past, but didn&#x27;t feel good about all of the plastic that was going into the landfill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They shaved me pretty good in both razors with only minor nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are every bit as comfortable as the not very sharp or close shaving Derbys.</li>
            <li>These are decent double edge razors but don&#x27;t expect more than a handful of shaves out of them if you have course/solid stubble.</li>
            <li>First couple shaves are great, but razors don&#x27;t stay sharp for too long.</li>
            <li>They do the job well and the smaller boxes make disposing of used razors easy.</li>
            <li>Five blades are held in an easy to open paper box.  </li>
            <li>I have strong facial hair (just like my opinions).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d certainly give these a try to see if they would work on your face.  </li>
            <li>No offense to the Shark blades intended, I certainly do like them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - honestly I am going to buy more when i need it, i may buy a few 100 packs so i dont have to order for a long while.</li>
            <li>: wet shaving is such a unique, independent experience for every individual, and just about any blade will be the very best one for someone.  </li>
            <li>Nice &amp; sharp... but not so sharp that it removes your top layers of skin (like feathers).</li>
            <li>First safety razor, and only blades I&#x27;ve used, so I have no basis for comparison, yet, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with these blades so far.</li>
            <li>Both do fine at getting at the large and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>7am, after the shave, my face looks fine (the shave is close enough) after the Sharks, but there is a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 5 o&#x27;clock.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them for the past year, and out of 15 other brands these are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so I have no comparison, but they work fine for me and seem to last a while.</li>
            <li>I love these things paired with my Merkur Model 38 HD Classic Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>My go to blade before work, feel like it would be hard to cut myself but still get a really good shave.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge learning curve when learning how to switch to a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>I am 100% happy with this purchase, switching to shaving soap and a safety razor was a great decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;The number of shaves for each blade is insane, I have used 8 blades in a year!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s really a matter of opinion and really it depends on how you like shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shaving upward or &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; because i get irritated skin fast.</li>
            <li>These have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>and this product will allow you to have a very close shave...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades worked very well for me</li>
            <li>Really there is no contest between the two manufacturers.</li>
            <li>, I use them in a straight style razor.  </li>
            <li>But I still like the idea of getting a real close shave, every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought of going whole hog to a straight razor, but decided to make this baby step first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the time being, I&#x27;ve abandoned the idea of going for a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t figure there is much to gain, except for the $8/year savings on blades that I could avoid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one razor for a whole week, and it has treated me very well.</li>
            <li>At this price you could replace the blade every day and still not spend as much as you would with cartridges.</li>
            <li>Feathers being one of them) but really, the Sharks work well</li>
            <li>I really like these blades in my weishi</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and get a lot of</li>
            <li>I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li>They work very well for my face and in each of my razors.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the used-blade receptacle that comes with each 5 pack.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve used Shark&#x27;s stainless blades before I consider these to be a bit of an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>really close shaves before changing blades.</li>
            <li>not so much.  </li>
            <li>These blades give a really close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend these ones!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly between the very sharpest blades &#x27;Sharks and Feathers&#x27; Id have to say that Sharks shaved my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Merkurs and Lords also did very well tho</li>
            <li>Buy the chrome ones and not the stainless steel ones.</li>
            <li>These blades are made very well</li>
            <li>These are in boxes that include five razors, so no need to have the whole box on the counter.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with these blades.</li>
            <li>the Shark blade is a smoother shave and much sharper blade.</li>
            <li>but I cut myself a lot when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it is better to spend the extra few dollars for the better blades</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like these blades.</li>
            <li>but I read that several of the reviewers said that using a double edged razor was more economical than using disposables.  </li>
            <li>so I was ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I received these blades in a sampler pack, and so far they are my second favorite blade in the pack</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s face, razor, and technique is different, so a description of how closely these blades cut isn&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li>(my first choice being the Big Ben Super Chrome blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are sharp and give a better shave with my 1920&#x27;s Gillette Safety razor than any of those modern 4/5 blade razors I used to use.  </li>
            <li>These are sharp and cheap!</li>
            <li>like many other people used the razor blade that came with the product.</li>
            <li>It is way better than paying the prices for the other type, but it takes time learning how to use this type of blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 5/1/2013: Am still using these, and stand by my original review (above).  </li>
            <li>I HAVE GOTTEN 6 SHAVES OUT OF MY FIRST BLADE WITH NO PROBLEMS WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY  FOR MORE EXPENSIVE BLADES</li>
            <li>For the cost I cant recommend any other blade delivering a better value.</li>
            <li>originally bought these blades to switch from multi-blade cartridge razors, because of razor burn on my neck that I have had my entire shaving life (15 years).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you sample blades before you buy a large quantity.</li>
            <li>very sharp and gives a good shave about the same as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>but people new to wet shaving &#x27;REALLY&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t use them OK as it does take a bit of practice.....</li>
            <li>I buy again, I&#x27;ll go for the Super Stainless and save a few of dollars since the container which holds the blades is not all that important to me.</li>
            <li>The blades work fine and for a long time (almost two weeks each blade).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the only other one I liked near as much were the Derby brand.</li>
            <li>My husband had been looking for a high quality product and these really fill the bill.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a Feather yet, but I find these Sharks to be quite sharp enough for my liking and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>i just used my first one, and its smooth and sharp, doesnt cause irritation.</li>
            <li>They cut smoothly, last longer than I expected, and clean easily under running water.  </li>
            <li>they are OK, XTG just average.  </li>
            <li>This purchase came fast and will save me the cost of the much more expensive razors you buy for $7, $10, or more at the store.</li>
            <li>I have a Feather Safety Razor and use Prorasor Shaving soap or sometimes Old Tayolors Almond shaving soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li>After years of lightweight disposable razors, I decided to return to the tried and true double edge razor blades</li>
            <li>These are great blades not super sharp but hold an edge for 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li>Just as good as all the new blades only cost you way less.</li>
            <li>But the Merkur blades I had been using previously worked better on me.</li>
            <li>I shaved first with the grain then against the grain with no nicks or cuts and I got a better shave than I usually do with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s entertaining to read reviews of razor blades:  they either seem to be head and shoulders above all others, or total garbage...</li>
            <li>Shark Super Chrome Double Edged Blades.</li>
            <li>The extra baggage that goes with straight razors isn&#x27;t worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I can only get lucky to have one painless shave out of these blades.</li>
            <li>never go back to regular blade cartridges, this are much better.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, definitely will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>different faces prefer different blades so you might be better off trying a sampler pack</li>
            <li>i bring these blades in particular.</li>
            <li>have tried many brands, and the only ones that came &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to the same results were Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than today&#x27;s MORE expensive blades.</li>
            <li>The reviews were decent</li>
            <li>They are cheap, come very sharp and I normally only go through 1 blade per week, so this hundred pack will do me fine for almost two years.  </li>
            <li>not as keen as some others (feathers of course, and less so than astra SP or Personna blues), but smooth and consistent.  </li>
            <li>A good middle of the road blade, I find them tame and not to aggressive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these blades.  </li>
            <li>though double-edged razors are highly hit-or-miss, I would recommend giving these a try.  </li>
            <li>i highly suggest getting into safety razors.</li>
            <li>They will pay for themselves and the high quality safety razor within the 1st year.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend you give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend for those safety razor users.</li>
            <li>Ample supply and high quality blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other blade reviews that suggest trying out different types for your own razor</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are sharp and great quality, they bundle means I don&#x27;t have to worry for a long time about getting replacement blades, especially at the pricing of cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheap but not in quality just in price, it is great quality and actually lasts at least 3 shaves while staying extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to buy the overly expensive stuff any more and the shave is just fine, thanks.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough for a good, clean shave but a little gentler than others.</li>
            <li>I have completely switched from cartridge to safety razors now with the exception of traveling since you are not allowed to take a straight edge blade on the plane.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money of quality blade.</li>
            <li>I could probably get a few more shaves per blade, but at 15 cents a piece, why bother?  </li>
            <li>Bought these to go with a razor and he has not complained yet.</li>
            <li>the kind of guy with a thick beard who has a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow 10 minutes after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Astra, the Feathers were only slightly noticeably better, and definitely not worth more than twice as much quite frankly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommednation</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t take to the \\&quot;modern technology\\&quot; that new razor styles offer.</li>
            <li>I define my beard texture as a coarse beard with skin that&#x27;s mild to moderately sensitive.</li>
            <li>its funny how old is new better way of shaving ill will never go back to disposable love</li>
            <li>brand blades, and a couple others, and quickly realized these blades are probably what you&#x27;d consider &amp;#34;middle-of-the-road.&amp;#34;  Other blades are sharper, but certainly others are not.  </li>
            <li>The others, like Derby, are fine, but much more expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Admittedly, I have only had one shave with these blades, so I cannot attest to their durability or consistency, but I had a four day&#x27;s growth on my face prior to the shave, and the blade cut through my whiskers just fine with no tugging or dragging.  </li>
            <li>really decent blade, like the Gillette Silver Blue for example, will take off close in the first swipe.</li>
            <li>No bloody tissues or any issues with being too sharp.</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp, light and cut like a diamond edge.</li>
            <li>At the rate, this is the most economical mean to shave just short of a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>Sharp, and cheap in bulk.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless</li>
            <li>Then they would soak me for the new model and replacement blades cost a fortune also.</li>
            <li>Then replacement blades for electrics cost as much as a new razor, or close to it.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t feel wasteful using a new blade every shave.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razor shaving</li>
            <li>My new blades cost just under $12.00 for 100.</li>
            <li>Because these razors cut more stubborn matter or hair off the face, they tend to dull much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Initial sharpness is close to mercur&#x27;s factory blades, however these do dull more quickly.</li>
            <li>I learned online that most of the blade \\&quot;wear\\&quot; is actually corrosion from putting a blade away wet.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I do go back and forth between cheap Barbasol from the local grocery store for about a buck (I use [[</li>
            <li>I also recommend them to my friends and family as i am trying to show them the way away from the carts and the crap that you buy in canada that isn&#x27;t safety razors or straight razors which is the best way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have posted, they do not stay sharp for long, but, even with thick whiskers, you can get one excellent shave from each side of a blade.</li>
            <li>note to newbies: DON&#x27;T press as hard as you do with &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; type razors or you&#x27;ll need a styptic pen :) If you have the right head on your razor(they are different btw) and get the angle right shaving with these is actually a pleasure.</li>
            <li>my only concern is that the used blades don&#x27;t fit back under the holders like on other DE blades I&#x27;ve gotten before, not a big problem if you have a razor safe for them, but its something I wanted to pass on.</li>
            <li>Great razor blades that stay sharp for at least 4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li>For my first DE shave I lathered my face the same way I would with the Fusion and loaded a Shark blade into the razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought these with out doing my homework and by far these are the nicest blades yet!</li>
            <li>(still looks professional if you wear a tie!).</li>
            <li>But personally, I am thinking I&#x27;d like to try some other blades, maybe just because I can, and it makes things interesting.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why, 2nd order &amp; I might as well use the first batch of used blades.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>In the past I have payed more for duller blades by wilkinson sword.&lt;br</li>
            <li>oh and it stayed sharp enough for two more</li>
            <li>but I got these with an order I placed on Amazon and used the first and last one of these blades I will ever use.</li>
            <li>I found that this blade was the only one that gave me consistent, baby&#x27;s-butt-smooth, nick/burn-free shaves with a VARIETY of razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Can be flipped over (not sure if you get much more out of it this way</li>
            <li>The Feathers ( Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades), as another reviewer stated, lasted for more shaves, but were too sharp, often nicking my head and increasing the chances of repeat nicking.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If I tried these first, I would have gone back to disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li>Some are prone to cause nicks on the first shave, and actually improve after being honed on you face (to the detriment of your face).</li>
            <li>Try a sampler pack (mixed brands) first, and then make your decision based on that.  </li>
            <li>but I am not sure which are better.</li>
            <li>I was listening to the Howard Stern show and came upon a advertisment for the Dollar Shave Club, which interested me enough to do some research and read some reviews.  </li>
            <li>Astra (as good as the Feathers, for less than half the price)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they keep an edged thrugh a few shaves and better price even than the cheap ones which are getting harder to find at the local drug store</li>
            <li>The most comfortable and closest shaving of the three top blades I tried and the least expensive too boot,</li>
            <li>Give yourself a little luxury with the savings, and buy some pre-shave oil, a decent badger-hair brush, a worthwhile shaving cream/soap, and see how big a difference this makes for you.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Not only do these maintain their sharpness for a long time, they are smooth and leave your face feeling like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth long lasting blade.</li>
            <li>Cuts through the heavy stuff easily.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp and seem to hold an edge longer than some other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried Shark, Derby ( sucked for me), Feather ( great but not worth it to me, slight step down IMO at a higher price tag.)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much, only one other brand to compare to, but these seem better than the ones (Derby Extra) that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 100 count expected very consistent results.</li>
            <li>the first two shaves with a new blade in a long Mercury handle.</li>
            <li>I have facial hair like steel wool, most DE blades can get about half of my face done before they start nicking my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably only use these for quick WTG shaves, when time or laziness don&#x27;t allow for a proper shave.  </li>
            <li>Frankly I cannot tell the difference; both give a super shave and seem to last the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They provide a decent shave and are cheap enough to throw away after every other shave</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I use Proraso sensitive shave soap, an alum block, and Gillette sensitive after shave balm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not easy to see this when lookong at the box, but it is in fact suppposed to function easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d encourage anyone new to traditional wet shaving to buy a sampler pack first and try several different blades until they find one they feel comfortable with--but in light of the due diligence described above, I&#x27;ve decided that the Shark Super Chrome is definitely the blade for me.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, I shave daily 5 days a week and swap these out once a week which I am certain is overkill</li>
            <li>overall, I found the quality in some little packets to be better than others.</li>
            <li>These things are super sharp.</li>
            <li>I have kids at home and worry about them getting into the blades.the hard case served as a safe place to store the used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are super sharp and durable.</li>
            <li>Two of my sons now use a safety razor and these super sharp blades from Shark.  </li>
            <li>Now I Had Never Used Sharks Before As I Tend To Shun &#x27;Super Sharp&#x27; Blades.....</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well these blades work.  </li>
            <li>I looked like a 12 year old just learning how to shave.</li>
            <li>I would stay far away from these and grab some of the Personna or Wilkinson Sword Razors.</li>
            <li>They are shape but not like shave with a wild cat on a stick.</li>
            <li>They also seem to vary wildly from blade to blade.</li>
            <li>When it comes to razor blades you cant really recommend some to others because everyone has a different face and beard.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face and these turned out to be among the gentler blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I got mine at our local WalMart for much cheaper, with no shipping.  </li>
            <li>My husband has decided to go old school.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care if I only get one shave out of 30% of the blades and</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have an urge to explore further.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and they do not irritate my face.</li>
            <li>My beard is probably medium thickness (my Dad says it is thicker than his, but I&#x27;ve seen beards far thicker than mine).    </li>
            <li>Terrific blades and work very well.</li>
            <li>I have a course beard but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These blades give a very close shave but are forgiving enough for beginner shaver.  </li>
            <li>so at that rate I just bought blades for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some affordable razors to last the whole year</li>
            <li>If I had an old school shaver handle, I&#x27;d probably shave with these since they&#x27;re cheaper</li>
            <li>isnt really that coarse</li>
            <li>far as the blades go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can put the big box in storage and have a couple sitting out ready to go</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for 20 years or so, and professionally for around 15 of them.  </li>
            <li>about 4 shaves per blades so far.</li>
            <li>One box of Shark blades has lasted me over a year so far.</li>
            <li>I have had really good shaves with sharks in the past and they do usually \\&quot;get the job done\\&quot; but there have been times when I have absolutely torn my face up with these things which I have NEVER done with a Feather.</li>
            <li>You get a over a year&#x27;s worth of shaving for such a low price!</li>
            <li>I read every where that it&#x27;s difficult to find a good blade for your skin and hair type, so I bought a sampler pack.</li>
            <li>These little blades are wicked sharp and last a good while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends who swear by these razors, but unless you have tough, leathery skin, and a fine, straight, normal beard</li>
            <li>I enjoy shark blades over feathers for there not so aggressive feeling yet sharp enough for up to 4 shaves and sometimes 5 or 6</li>
            <li>These are sharp, smooth, and a TERRIFIC value.  </li>
            <li>These blades are simply amazing (only when compared to any of the cartridge razors, as I have only bought these double edge safety razor blades I cannot compare these to any other brands)!</li>
            <li>super sharp, cuts through my stubble like a boss!</li>
            <li>These little babies were the result of a desire to cut down on cost, and it&#x27;s been a tremendously effective move.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy since making the switch to DE blades because they are so much less expensive than razor cartridges and I feel like they last longer.</li>
            <li>Big Ben was also a decent runner up.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, it will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li>So the next time I was extremely careful and took my sweet time shaving.</li>
            <li>but the price was low enough that I was willing to try them out regardless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three different kinds of blades now (Persona USA blue, and Shark Super Stainless were the other two).</li>
            <li>Really sharp yet forgiving, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that beginner Double Edge Safety Blade users give these a try.    </li>
            <li>This last year I discovered traditional wet shaving (for many of the same reasons that I&#x27;ve seen others articulate--cost, comfort, etc.), and bought a sampler pack that I found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>These blades provide a super smooth and close shave for mere pennies.</li>
            <li>You will not go wrong with these blades, for a super smooth shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;These razors are sharp, surprisingly long lasting, and provide a smooth, comfortable shave for considerably less than I had been spending.</li>
            <li>That said, I have absolutely no idea how anyone could provide a rating higher than a &#x60;3&#x27; for these blades.  </li>
            <li>tend to agree with earlier reviewers that these blades being a bit thin that they are only good for 3 or maybe 4 shaves before they should be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come in convenient 5-blade packs, so you can just bring a few along on a trip, etc (also, it&#x27;s better than a box of 100 loose blades).</li>
            <li>I think I have found the combination of the right shaver, blade, pre-shave and shave soap that will keep me a double edge shaver for a very long time.</li>
            <li>They cut me a little on the first use and then actually work better after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Little to no irritation and a much closer shave for much much cheaper than gilletes cartridges.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, and they shave fairly well even when I let the stubble grow in a little thicker than I probably should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other product my wife bought me was the 100 pack of the Shark Super Chrome blades which I did not initially use because I had the 5 Merkur blades that came with my shaver.  </li>
            <li>One end of the plastic box actually has a hinge that allow the whole end of the box to pop open.  </li>
            <li>So, when you do the math, the Feathers are at least equal in price and provide better shaves (one shave at $0.17 for Shark or two Feather shaves at $0.34).  </li>
            <li>it seems to me that one side of the blade will stick out just a bit more that the other side will so use the short side for general shaving and the long side of the blade for your last pass or your finish cut to get that</li>
            <li>Also, they irritated my face like no other.</li>
            <li>had always thought that the double-edge razor was something of a relic of the past, somewhere between the straight razor used in the old west and in barber shops, and the modern day electrics or Bic disposible types.  </li>
            <li>These get the job done like all the others I tried but there was one major difference that makes them my preferred blades.  </li>
            <li>These are sharp and consistent.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the merkur blades my razor came with but still plenty sharp and last more than a shave.</li>
            <li>I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior.</li>
            <li>The first shave i had with this blade, my beard growth was quite thick about 3 weeks of growth and the blade cut right through and only needed 2 passes,</li>
            <li>Good blades, thin and sharp..</li>
            <li>They dull up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>last remarks are that Shark Blades are really good blades and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try them, But just use a little care and common sense with something like this as they are really sharp but just keep in mind that other blades may work just a mite better in the long run is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff</li>
            <li>but still didn&#x27;t like it, and the Personna ones which weren&#x27;t too bad but weren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li>for over 3 years now, and have been shaving in general for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>Though I do not have a precision caliper to measure the blades, I am pretty sure I ran across a five pack that protruded too far from the razor and gave me some unpleasant cuts.</li>
            <li>Going with an old fashioned razor over the double and triple edge blades has saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>They work well, about as well as Derbys, although those are the only 2 brands I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>They are the sharpest and longest lasting ones I have had so far.</li>
            <li>So decided to try the old fashion style Double Edge Safety Razor bought one here on Amazon along with \\&quot;100</li>
            <li>The old double edged razor takes some getting used to</li>
            <li>I can say that so far, I&#x27;m into the second week with this blade, and it still seems to shave quite well, with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>With the second shave with the shark blades I fixed my technique and  had not cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li>After spending hundreds of dollars on multiple cartridges for my old razor</li>
            <li>These are for manly men who can &#x27;rasle a bear with their bare hands so beware.  </li>
            <li>, well I actually learned with a gillette way bac in the early 70&#x27;s then switched to an Atra for 30 plus years.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my facial hair</li>
            <li>These in my razor give me the closest shave without any nicks or cuts and just glides through my whiskers and this just using regular old shaving cream in a can..</li>
            <li>After the first swipe, the shave was rough and left stubble behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I could make this blade work, and it is better than a cartridge razor, but I would be compromising and putting up with some unnecessary cuts and redness.</li>
            <li>I shave 3 times a week and do notice a very slight degradation in performance on the third shave with the blades, but nothing major, simply meaning that the third pass is somewhat more necessary.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty sharp!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a cheaper option that going with the new fancy cartridge razors and blades at $18+ for only a pack of eight blades!</li>
            <li>I am new to double edge shaving  and purchased a sample assortment I only used one or these blades and I am throwing the rest away the razor iI</li>
            <li>I typically get two weeks worth of shaves out of this razor when I was getting only one with all the others.</li>
            <li>Very sharp I got 5 shaves from the first blade</li>
            <li>After the first shave, I thought, maybe I was just too used to my previous brand</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp, last for several shaves and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Even following the guidelines that I saw on the videos, of steaming my face with a hot wet towel for 5 minutes before shaving and just using the weight of the razor, I was getting nicks and irritation, especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li>A good compromise between the ultra sharpness but short life of some blades, and the long life but questionable edge of others.</li>
            <li>Remember, a dull blade is more dangerous than a sharp one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the blade is sharper it will last more shaves, so the extra money you&#x27;re paying for these blades will more than ever out than if you bought cheaper less sharper ones.</li>
            <li>The average life of the blades is pretty much the same as other blades and these are the hardest blades to get out of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>There are some important principles that customers must understand before seriously considering this review:    1)</li>
            <li>I grow just enough stubble to annoy my girlfriend, but not enough for most blades to get on a daily basis without shaving against the grain and risking serious skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>At the same time I was trying out several different razors (from a contemporary Merkur to several pre-WWII vintage Gillette razors), so each blade was used in a variety of razors.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine  how much I have spent on blades for my Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>I figured each would last as long as a cartridge does for a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is somewhat sensitive, I have always found myself wanting for a shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and leave those tiny red bumps.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different blades, and keep coming back to Sharks Super Chrome...</li>
            <li>am new to the single blade</li>
            <li>This little razor might not be what you expect at first.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and extremely durable.</li>
            <li>I have used them on five different occasions, and no matter how much prep, and how careful I am, I end up with a face full of nicks and cuts, and I mean a lot.  </li>
            <li>They are so much cheaper than other disposable blades and will probably last me for a couple years.</li>
            <li>I dont know if they&#x27;re dull or what, but they pull hair and require multiple passes to get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>Just use caution for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>Shark blades are thick and sharp enough to make them very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>This blade is incredibly smooth and gives a great shave, except when you get to the chin and around the nose, then it feels clumsy, awkward, and a little risky for cuts.</li>
            <li>Second time buying these blades, first set of 100 lasted me a little over a year</li>
            <li>I was using Feather blades and they did well for the most part, but sometimes left me a little raw on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very well very sharp</li>
            <li>New to DE community so not much experience in this area</li>
            <li>I snap them in half and use with my straight razor.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say if another brand would cut less</li>
            <li>The amount of money you save on buying a years supply of Sharks vs a years supply of the \\&quot;hi tech\\&quot; pieces of crap advertised by the TV models will pay for your nice razor in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the last disposable I was using the 5 blade Gillette Proglide with the vibrating handle seemed to work fairly well for me, I took notice of the fact that the replacement blades were very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Maybe everyone should slow down and realize that shaving can be enjoyable.</li>
            <li>They are definitely the sharpest blades I have used and to avoid cuts I put very little pressure on the razor and swipe nice and slow, going with the hair, along the grain.  </li>
            <li>I just never really paid much attention to how long my blade was lasting before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too sharp but not dull.</li>
            <li>Prior to using a DE safety razor, I used the BIC single blade sensitive skin razors exclusively.</li>
            <li>The shave was OK, but When I went to buy new blades, I was shocked to see that each blade cost nearly $4!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That was the tipping point.  </li>
            <li>After slamming the poor packaging of the otherwise fine Shark blade, I have discovered how the packaging is designed to work.  </li>
            <li>These blades stay sharp long enough for me to replace them once every two weeks, and I do a WHOLE lot of shaving.     </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that this little blade could do so much.</li>
            <li>Without getting too scientific, the difference in the Super Chrome&#x27;s lie in the blades ability to cut through very small bits of stubborn matter on the face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just feel these are not the best for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;d recommend that anyone who uses a double-edge razor to try a variety of blades and stick with what works best for that user.  </li>

            <li> So I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> These razors were a great buy good quality and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Have a nice day !</li>
            <li> Good beginner and experienced DE shaver blade.</li>
            <li> Good shave with these blades, great price</li>
            <li> These blades I have found to be more than acceptable and give me excellent service of 5 to 7 days before having to replace them.  </li>
            <li> these blades are perfect and I love using them on my head as well as they are forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I tried Astra and like them better, but they are both excellent and affordable.</li>
            <li> So, to each his own!</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face, so it works out to be an amazing value and a great shave every time.    </li>
            <li> Many said they where the perfect balance of sharpness and quality, and they provided an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> Good razors.</li>
            <li> My husband said they gave him a superior shave to the Merkur blades that came with his safety razor and they cost a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Great deal for the money, and nice to have a supply fo a while.</li>
            <li> Good balance of sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li> Smooth and no nicks great!</li>
            <li> Buy a good one.</li>
            <li> They are good blades.</li>
            <li> That being said with the 100 pack i should be good for quite a while.</li>
            <li> These razors, in conjunction with a good safety razor and some Colonel Conk&#x27;s Shaving Cream and a Mr. Tweezerman&#x27;s badger-hair shave brush, I am in shaving heaven.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades feathers, derbys, personas, merkur, and I&#x27;ve found good ones but for the price</li>
            <li> Thus, the Chrome gives a superior or smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> Good price for good blade</li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> ASTRA PLATIMUM( good),</li>
            <li> If you take your time these are superior in my experience.</li>
            <li> Good product and I like how they are packaged.  </li>
            <li> hey, its a heckuva good value.</li>
            <li> this a good bladed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with the Astra Superior Platinum blades.</li>
            <li> For the price they are a good deal</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for about five shaves each.</li>
            <li> A blade is good for 2-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> I had a good lather</li>
            <li> Some get a good shave with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a good, close shave with these.</li>
            <li> I can get a close 2-3 shaves, but there&#x27;s a good amount of irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> Can you get a good shave with this blade?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Cheap and cuts great!</li>
            <li> These seem to do quite a good job.</li>
            <li> Shark Chrome razors  are good but not as good as Feather or Astra.</li>
            <li> But these blades aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> , good thing I have a hundred of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades consistantly keep a good edge for seven shave days.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with these blades, and they do a good job of it.  </li>
            <li> A good beginner blade.</li>
            <li> Get the 100 pack w/ free shipping for best value.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades...forgiving and cheap (can get them for under .10/blade if you buy it in volume).  </li>
            <li> Good, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered these blades a couple of times already, and plan on keeping a good stock on hand...</li>
            <li> Each blade good for 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> These blades are good for one shave....</li>
            <li> Seem like good quality.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Feather blades I purchased.</li>
            <li> to be fair I tested them both in my Merkur Adjustable and also in a Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item was received sooner than I anticipated, surprising me with it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li> These are good blades and bought a load of them.</li>
            <li> They are not the sharpest, but are also fairly forgiving in terms of shaving technique and kept the razor burn under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> 4 good shaves</li>
            <li> Good blades.</li>
            <li> For those that use this style of razor as opposed to the kind with 2-8 blades in them, these are excellent, cheap, and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Feather (exceptional, but expensive)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> was very satisfied with the Shark blades.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad that I read the reviews for these blades, for 17cents a piece I&#x27;m jumping for joy over here.  </li>
            <li> Works great and cheap!</li>
            <li> Bought him the shaving soap with bowl and soap brush, he&#x27;s much happy using these - he says it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all :-)</li>
            <li> With this in mind, I will say that this is a great razor, but I have found better.</li>
            <li> for me this was the first blade i tried and was the best.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you can find any better that Shark Blades!</li>
            <li> you get a better shave!</li>
            <li> Glad I made the change!</li>
            <li> but those are so pricey that it negates one of the best arguments for DE shaving..namely the large cost saving.</li>
            <li> Large amount but perfect!!</li>
            <li> The quality of shave with these blades is truly amazing.   </li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that for me this blade provides an amazing close shave</li>
            <li> So anyone want about 45 Shark Blades for free, lol.  </li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing</li>
            <li> these things are amazing.</li>
            <li> I get a nice shave, and they each blade lasts for 2-3 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Just let the blade glide over your face under its own weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> own an Edwin Jagger DE 89.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of blades, nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have not had a closer shave with any of the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; brand name razors.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves how it gives a nice close shave every morning, he gave up on disposable razors and his cordless/corded shaver.</li>
            <li> They do a good job, and I think they are better than just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> These are nice blades, quality edges that seem to hold up well.</li>
            <li> tried them in was a feather popular</li>
            <li> I bought myself a safety razor---you know, the kind your dad or grandpa used.  </li>
            <li> I like these razors but to each his/her own.  </li>
            <li> The bulk pack is nice as well.  </li>
            <li> but I think there are more suitable matches!</li>
            <li> The fact that they are so cheap makes them even more attractive.    </li>
            <li> bought these through Amazon, the packaged arrived quickly, packaged well and am quite happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shark Super Chrome blades for over a year now and have had great results with these blades.</li>
            <li> They nick and cut very easily.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased!</li>
            <li> A very good bargain, and an absolute steal compared to your store bought blades</li>
            <li> It honestly take more than 3 passes for me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think because it&#x27;s cheap that it can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Shark blades for nearly 2 years and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m still a very happy \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; DE razor user.  </li>
            <li> so far these razors are working great!</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, I ran my own tests with razors in my price range.  </li>
            <li> They were by far the best, smoothest, and sharpest.</li>
            <li> but so far I am very happy with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And by far the best blades by Lord.</li>
            <li> These blades are best so far.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get a great shave out of them in my more mild razors like the Merkur HD.  </li>
            <li> If money is tight, I would try one or two sample packs to get an idea of what works best, but you should try 5 - 10 blades, in my opinion, to get the best feel over time for what is going to give you the most comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a great shave that is in my opinion better then a derby and cheaper then one too, then get these, try them out i am very sure that you will like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li> Now I have a supply of good blade at a very good price that will last years!</li>
            <li> I just got done with my first shave using the sharks and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> : Go out and buy these unless you really need the best of the best (really course, fast growing</li>
            <li> you can not beat the price, even if you changed the blade for every shave, you get a close shave, they leave your face very smooth</li>
            <li> the blade tugged and pulled and didn&#x27;t leave me with a very smooth face I will have to shave with another blade</li>
            <li> SHAVE IS VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on to my quest for a blade that suits me better.</li>
            <li> I had a better experience with the Astra Platinum that came as a sample pack with the razor or</li>
            <li> It takes me more than one pass to get all the stubble.</li>
            <li> I got these in bulk before trying them out, and I&#x27;m still glad I did.  </li>
            <li> If I did my part, then, the shaving experience was never horrible... just not optimal.  </li>
            <li> I had so many knicks and cuts in my face</li>
            <li> you like them buy them two packs at a time with free shipping!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you save money when getting this rather than the blades that I use to get.</li>
            <li> I seems to be more prone to nicks with this razor compared to others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The wilkinson sword blades at wallmart are way better than these.</li>
            <li> The feather has an unforgiving feel to it, and the shark allows me to be able to repeat pass problem areas without worrying about cuts.  </li>
            <li> doing some more research here on Amazon and The Badger &amp; Blade website, I found a lot of people where recommending these Shark Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> I have been able to shave with one blade from Monday to Sunday, changing the blade each Sunday after shaving.  </li>
            <li> There may be better razors out there</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> I have 97 more to go...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more blades.</li>
            <li> For better blades consider the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it will be a while before i need to buy more.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I maybe getting more than a week out of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would.  </li>
            <li> But I found that if I take my time and use the shave soap, I get a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li> These blades are ok.  </li>
            <li> two thumbs up and my recommendation to buy them! :)</li>
            <li> I bought these razor blades along with an awesome razor and I am so glad I will never have to go back to disposable razors again.</li>
            <li> Plus you get so many at once</li>
            <li> (I love how many come in</li>
            <li> I use them in my Merkur and like them much better than the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> listen to what many reviewers have said that you should not</li>
            <li> PolSilver ( got the biggest knick on this one, more my fault not the blades</li>
            <li> Better razors do exist out there</li>
            <li> These are my favorite DE blades.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur razor that I have tried to use these on as they are more inexpensive than Merkur&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sharks as part of a sampler and glad now that I did.</li>
            <li> so the blades leave a nice smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> So cheap!</li>
            <li> The top of that list being the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Of the three, these are the sharpest, and the most uniform in quality.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more when this pack runs out.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite at this price.</li>
            <li> Better than the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Safe shave.</li>
            <li> It is what it say it is, a freakin ton of razors i dont know why i bought so many.</li>
            <li> Make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing with the razor before you blame all the nicks and cuts on the blade.    </li>
            <li> After figuring out how to use the razor, I bought an alum block and a blade sampler to see if there were better blades out there.</li>
            <li> Is it better than a cartridge razor?</li>
            <li> You better believe it.</li>
            <li> I have found that BIC and Feather blades work best for my face compared to Shark, Derby, Merkur, and Red Personna.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these when I use them up.</li>
            <li> I like the Derby blades,  but love these.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> It makes me laugh that 3. 4, 5, track razors even sell- because you cannot get a closer or better shave with a good safety razor</li>
            <li> and I had whipped up a good lather on a freshly washed  face  </li>
            <li> My husband just love the feel of this blade.</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY OF THE BADES IS OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> pleased with this product as well.</li>
            <li> But these Sharks stood at the top for me,</li>
            <li> Has more blades</li>
            <li> My best suggestion is to find a sample pack of various types of razors.</li>
            <li> Most blades come in cardboard.  </li>
            <li> These things are cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> shark brand is ok</li>
            <li> Pleased with the DE razor replacements.  </li>
            <li> I found out the blades were CHEAP!  </li>
            <li> Even better, I get a closer shave with this blade than with the newest Gillette creation.  </li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave everytime.</li>
            <li> Better shave too</li>
            <li> I have tried five different brands of blades, and these have performed the best.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but I find that Personna blades work better with my razors.</li>
            <li> So for the most part i&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> They seem to cause a bit more irritation than others as well.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been satisfied with them, but the bulk discount of these razors had him sold.  </li>
            <li> Sample before buying too many.</li>
            <li> , these still cut OK</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use a blade more than 4 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double-edged safety razor for over a year now and feel competent to rate these.  </li>
            <li> They turned out to be better than the Merkur blades</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  </li>
            <li> love this blades.</li>
            <li> have had much better experience with Merkur Blades.</li>
            <li> I have a lifetime supply of razors now :)</li>
            <li> I love this razor and my skin does as well</li>
            <li> And it is a much better shave.</li>
            <li> gonna try the Israeli Personna&#x27;s next time, I hear good things!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I did not buy so many.  </li>
            <li> and I get more irritation from using these.  </li>
            <li> but I wish I would have tried these before buying so many.</li>
            <li> Add for more words</li>
            <li> I use them primarily to shave my legs, but I get a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> For a smooth and close shave, these are the best I found so far.</li>
            <li> Okay product for the price</li>
            <li> Depending on how course your beard is you may be able to get 3 or 4 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade to pair with my parker razor.</li>
            <li> More so than even Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I gave the rest of the pack to my brother in-law and he seems to love them.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice close and clean shave, these are the shaver blades I recommend that you use on your face.</li>
            <li> Shark provides a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Blades shave nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I use it with my safety razor and it provides a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Be kind to your skin, that&#x27;s the reason we started shaving this way right!?</li>
            <li> That being said I&#x27;d strongly recommend to all that you buy a sampler pack of different brands (there are some here on amazon) and see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li> The work pretty good</li>
            <li> However these blades work pretty good for my face</li>
            <li> This type of shaving device has a long and excellent record all over the world.</li>
            <li> This equates into some blades giving up to 3 acceptable shaves with the first being really good.  </li>
            <li> When I first got my safety razor, I made the wise decision of buying a variety pack before buying anything in bulk.</li>
            <li> WIth any safety razor use a good quality shaving soap like Taylors or Prorasor and use hot water to rise face before lather and during shave to rinse blade.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> You may be able to find higher quality blades than Super Chromes, but these give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought these with my new shaver and they work great together.  </li>
            <li> Both myself and the wife liked the Shark Super Chromes, so I decided to order a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> nice feature of the super chromes is the plastic case that they come in.  </li>
            <li> Dorco (wonderful blades, won&#x27;t give the closest shave but very forgiving, also very economical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not had this smooth a shave in many many</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, razors are sharp, split the order with some family members got a few of them to switch to safety razors, win win for everyone :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they ae just fine.</li>
            <li> But the Shark blades certainly are a good price.  </li>
            <li> I have had somewhat better luck with disposables versus electrics and have tried all the latest and greatest disposables right up to the versions that are currently offered.  </li>
            <li> That said, these are very good value overall.</li>
            <li> Badger and blade has a wealth of information available including a long list of reviews and an excellent community of knowledgeable shavers.</li>
            <li> If you have skin that is sensitive to shaper blades, these would be great for you.</li>
            <li> These blades are great and are good for up to 5 shaves per week if you take care to clean and dry them.    </li>
            <li> but I seemed to get a cut and rash free shave with these more often than not.</li>
            <li> Wow, that was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who prefer wet shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and will allow you to have a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and these blades have a good edge on them.</li>
            <li> but honestly at $12 it was worth the risk for me.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are such a good deal!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Stayed sharp for 3-4 used</li>
            <li> but it is fairly easy to wipe away.</li>
            <li> They arrived in 20-5 blade packs, so it was easy to throw some in my dopp kit and some at my girlfriend&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> They come packaged in boxes of 10 and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you want a close, easy, shave around your chin and below your nose, try something else.</li>
            <li> Easy then to dispense a blade, or to slide used blades into the box for disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still fault the manufacturer because there are no instructions to determine this \\&quot;easy open\\&quot; feature, but it is there.</li>
            <li> While blades vary from user to user, these really have been the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> easy to cut yourself with</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret my decision to buy these in bulk because they represent a fair ripper of a deal and give a decently close shave.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!hey where as good as people said they where.</li>
            <li> They are durable, sharp and fit perfectly into my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Four words: Hot Knife, Warm Butter.</li>
            <li> great razors nice and sharp</li>
            <li> To be fair the competition ended up pretty much neck to neck but with the Feathers at $32/100 and giving me 2 good shaves (head and face), the Silver Blue&#x27;s at $23/100 with 2 good shaves, and the Sharks at $12/100 with</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp and using them with my butterfly safety razor is perfect for sculting my beard.  </li>
            <li> It will easily pay for itself, because these blades are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but the grain of my beard is funky around my chin.</li>
            <li> it is more consistent albeit more expensive/wasteful.</li>
            <li> I do my best in other areas to be economical/eco friendly</li>
            <li> Working just fine in my Weber Bulldog DE.</li>
            <li> Still, they work fine.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> Also this blades needs a very light touch and best to go slow with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could be a little sharper but all and all one of the best blades I have used.</li>
            <li> These little guys work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Huge difference in weight and feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t knock this product at all, its a HUGE value at 11 bucks for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> The shaves are close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Great blades, though I probably should have tried a smaller package.</li>
            <li> I went back to them and have had great shaves ever since.</li>
            <li> These blades cut smoothly for three to five days, which is all I ask.</li>
            <li> These shark blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I get the same great shave using one blade vs three.</li>
            <li> My face has not been this smooth since I was a baby.</li>
            <li> My face has not been this smooth since I was a baby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Sharks give me about 3-5 shaves per razor and cut fairly smooth up to that.  </li>
            <li> Personna (fantastic blades, made in the US if that matters to you)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The blades are a great value and will last me for years.</li>
            <li> the price is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> Pick these up with a safety razor and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li> This is a great double edge razor blade.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and for me, has eleimiated any razor burn/bumps under my neck.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy the 100 count because I liked them so much.</li>
            <li> and you will enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I change them out every week (3 shaves), just because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Great blades, way cheaper to use a double edge safety blade razor than buying the junk at walmart.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly light growth</li>
            <li> Before you buy a ton of any razors, buy just a few to see which one you like the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually I didn&#x27;t order them but they came free with a razor I just bought from Amazon</li>
            <li> really smooth shave</li>
            <li> Gives a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> do not give a smooth shave on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replace blade every few shaves for best result.</li>
            <li> If you need a smooth, close shave, these are your blades.</li>
            <li> Did I mention how smooth and comfortable</li>
            <li> Blades aren&#x27;t as readily available as they used to be, but they seem to be making a comeback.  </li>
            <li> I have moved on to Wilkinson Sword blades that are much better and giving me a good shave regularly 4-5 times per blade.</li>
            <li> The shave, however, is nowhere near as good as Astra.</li>
            <li> At a price of $17.50 for 100 I find that a yearly cost in blades, (assuming you are changing blades every five days), of $12.78 to be far superior to the replacement cost of the newer shaving gimmicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I think there a very good and sharp blade</li>
            <li> I get no cutting of my skin, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just didn&#x27;t work, For me these work perfect.</li>
            <li> -maybe there are other blades that are great and maybe even better-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay sharp for more than 3 shaves, but great deal for the price</li>
            <li> The shave per blade count is very economical too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 years now and very rarely cut myself.</li>
            <li> You just have to try several and find what works best for your particular beard/skin type.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades that give me a clean and crisp shave with a single pass.  </li>
            <li> Shark super chrome razor blades give me a close and comfortable shave with no razor burn and one blade will last a full week which makes them a great value also.</li>
            <li> At first I was amazed how much better my shaves where with the Merkur Razor Blades, but after awhile I noticed I was not getting as close a shave as I would like with them.</li>
            <li> A years worth of razors for 11 bucks!  </li>
            <li> Generally I shave 6 times a week and get a good shave each time.</li>
            <li> the blades are very good quality and rather inexpensive, these blades all 100 of them will last me atleast 2 years for 16$ plus shipping which wasnt much.</li>
            <li> They gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using straight razor for two years now, I love feather razors but gave these a whirl as the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different razor blades and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> For the relative price of this blade compared to the rest, this blade, in my opinion, was by far the best of the pack.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are careful you can get a good shave with them but for the value maybe Astra or Lords are really a &#x27;better bargain&#x27; for the number of quality shaves that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stainless steel are rougher and the chrome give a cleaner, closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The Shark Super Chromes are the smoothest of three being completely free of razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Super close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Great razors, nice compact packaging which allows you to distribute the razors slowly as you need them.</li>
            <li> The Shark Super Chrome work best for me, but make sure you try a sample of different blades before buying a larger pack.</li>
            <li> The true mettle of any blade is tested ATG, this is where these Sharks perform significantly below par.  </li>
            <li> They are still a good blade and better than some other&#x27;s I have tried, but, some blades are noticeably sharper than others.  </li>
            <li> That is, when the blade is new and for about 3 uses afterwards I can get excellent results with a single pass.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried many others - so some might be better, but these are low cost and work fine.</li>
            <li> These blades are decent but are certainly not the best for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this already great quality bundle of blades when there was a small sale, making it an even better value.  </li>
            <li> The Shark blades provide a great shave without drag...</li>
            <li> Good razors especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Solid, good valued blade.</li>
            <li> but you can only get about 2 good shaves with them</li>
            <li> However I noticed that I cut myself much more often with the Feather Razor Blades then with the Merkur Blades, and that I had very irritated skin after shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> You need at least 5-10 trials before getting the best out of a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with medium weight facial hair....</li>
            <li> Get yourself a good quality safety razor and buy a supply of these Shark Double Edge blades.  </li>
            <li> purchased these again because I loved them so much last time.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and these blades hold up well for at least 3-5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> These blades are economical and give him a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> but good enough for the amount and cost.</li>
            <li> These blades give a good shave at a low price.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Rob:)</li>
            <li> and I use Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades</li>
            <li> I will be switching back to Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> a good del and a solid brand.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really say how many shaves I can get from one blade yet but regardless, these are going to save me a lot of money over the cartridge blade alternative.</li>
            <li> You may get more shaves, but really at this price I am not worried about it.</li>
            <li> Buying the blades in 100 count really makes shaving so much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Really cool retro look.</li>
            <li> Way better than the Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li> I can shave a full month on one blade.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good buy</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li> In all, the Super Chromes last for about 2 really good close shaves and take off almost everything.  </li>
            <li> These blades came with the razor and I had forgotten how easy and nice it is to shave with an ACTUAL razor.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and smooth, my best results so far</li>
            <li> the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong, of course you can always buy a SAMPLER first to see which blades you liked best.</li>
            <li> extremely sharp DE blades, that will give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;no irritation, no bumps,</li>
            <li> They are great for learning since they aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as the Feather blades I now prefer.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell a big difference between these and the super stainless, they both work great.</li>
            <li> The Shark razor blades represent a tremendous value.  </li>
            <li> I soon switched to Astra which felt a lot smoother and reduced my razor burn tremendously</li>
            <li> I was given a 5 pack of shark super chrome and a Merkur 180 aka 23c by a friend.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> They are of much higher and more consistent quality then the Merkur Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> They are of much higher and more consistent quality then the Merkur Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> The Super Chromes man-handle through the close/stubborn matter.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and well.....</li>
            <li> The Shark blades did a great job, and I mention all of this only so that you&#x27;ll realize that I really have not had anything to compare these blades to yet.  </li>
            <li> I found that they dulled too quickly though.  </li>
            <li> These Shark Super Chromes at the time didn&#x27;t catch my attention</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll average 2-3 full face shaves on a razor which I believe is great considering the cost of these.</li>
            <li> Unscientifically, I tried about 5 brands in a sampler pack before settling on Shark Super Chrome.</li>
            <li> Because for the same price or maybe a dollar more per 100  you can get Astra which is a better blade.</li>
            <li> I get eight shave from each Shark Super Chrome blade.</li>
            <li> I had no nicks or irritation whatsoever with the Shark  Super Chrome blades.  </li>
            <li> I have found my blade, the Shark Super Chrome.  </li>
            <li> Very good value for very little money.</li>
            <li> No actually that isn&#x27;t exactly true, they are more comfortable and irritation free than the Derbys.</li>
            <li> Sharp and very nice.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Likes - everything, the blades sit nicely into the razor and is sharp through many shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendations - to anyone who wants a close shave that has hair like mine which is very course, although i am sure that anyone could with any type of hair would find them comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not as good as in the old days of using double edged blades, I don&#x27;t get as many shaves as I did with Gillette.</li>
            <li> Great blades for less than some of the more highly touted brands.</li>
            <li> Great sharp blade, will buy again!</li>
            <li> know its a &#x27;Straight razor&#x27; trick but believe me it really helps to take a good hot towel and stream your face first before you shave.....</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are very sharp and they perform great.</li>
            <li> This blade is great for the beginner DE shaver, very sharp and gives you closest shave you have ever experienced compared to a store bought, five blade, typical brand name razor.  </li>
            <li> as I really was not sure which blade would work best for</li>
            <li> The second shave was just as good as the first, in terms of sharpness.</li>
            <li> If you miss a day and have extra long stubble to shave, well, best of luck hacking away at it.</li>
            <li> To me, a fresh Shark Super Chrome feels like a Feather on day three.  </li>
            <li> As said, these are good single use blades for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband like his razer and shaving cream, It cut very close just what he wanted!!</li>
            <li> It is a lot more cost effective when you can buy 100 blades for less than 8 of the multi-blade razor blade.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very nice.</li>
            <li> At the price Shark charges, he&#x27;s more than happy to swap in new blades after only 2 shaves to ensure that each shave has a nearly pristine blade.</li>
            <li> In fact, this changed my shaving experience from one of purely mechanical perfunctory actions, to one where I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, as I do think these blades are OK (for me) and they certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.ey certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.</li>
            <li> They work great for my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It is very well balanced and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It gives a VERY forgiving and SMOOTH</li>
            <li> They are amazing and give a closer shave than what I used to get with my Mach III and its multiple blades.</li>
            <li> Only having 5 in a pack and not 10 is kind of a nuisance.</li>
            <li> On top of that I also have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Ordered a mixed bag of razors to test out the kinds I liked.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Favorite so far.</li>
            <li> As far as durability, don&#x27;t expect more than 2-3 shaves, with</li>
            <li> The 7AM&#x27;s will last for 3-4 nice shaves considering that you will feel that the shave isn&#x27;t the smoothest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two combined are so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Two years worth of razors for ~17 bucks can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than my old Fusion cartridges.</li>
            <li> I like them and feel it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the rest of these blades to get my money&#x27;s worth and then probably never buy them again.    </li>
            <li> I start Monday with a nice fresh balde and can get a weeks worth of facial shaving out of it.  </li>
            <li> Thats a years worth of shaving for $15.</li>
            <li> Figured id give these a shot and for 15 dollars if i liked them i was set, if not, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> This was by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I rarely get a nick.</li>
            <li> I bought a 100 pack for 11.95 that would be 8.5 years worth of blades compared to a one month supply of the cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li> But at 15 cents a blade, I have no problem putting in a fresh blade after a weeks use.  </li>
            <li> Blade was sharp and fit nicely in razor.</li>
            <li> Nice blades, not as smooth as the Wilkinson Sword, but sharp as SH*T, you&#x27;ll get 4-5 shaves from each one.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think they&#x27;re better than most other brands, even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, as I said, I don&#x27;t have much to compare these to, but I can certainly imagine that some of the higher rated blades, maybe Feather or even Derby, might be better blades in some way.  </li>
            <li> sure to open the razor and clean the blade after every use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Shark Super Chrome and the Shark Super Stainless blades for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Such a better way to get a close clean shave</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel the Shark razors are as sharp as Feathers, and for me, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to have some sort of coating which gives a much&lt;br /&gt;smoother shave than other blades I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d probably be just as good for any other razor.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good, sharp razors.  </li>
            <li> To be fair the other two are right there with the Sharks but the Sharks edge them out by a noticeable and not insignificant margin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right to the nub of it:  </li>
            <li> where right on the money.  </li>
            <li> All of the rave reviews on these blades where right on the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Loving the cost to use ratio right now.</li>
            <li> the guide is right for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> got to find the right match of blade and razor.  </li>
            <li> but right now it looks like the Sharks are going to be the winners.</li>
            <li> I probably should have ordered a sampler pack of many different brand blades in the beginning, but I have been fortunate enough to find these and they give me a smooth comfortable shave, no nicks and no bumps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Variety pack and the first blades I tried out where these Shark Razor Blades, as I was really curious if they where as good as people said they where.</li>
            <li> I was aware of these products but didn&#x27;t buy them because I felt at ten bucks each, they were not cost effective.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as good as the Shark Super Stainless in my opinion but those seem harder to find in bulk.</li>
            <li> The positive thing I can say that is far more economical to be shaving with this type of blade versus the mach type systems</li>
            <li> After about a week of use i switched back to Gillette 7 o&#x27;clocks because these just seemed to only give me one maybe two good shaves before i had to swap it out, as to where the Gillettes, i regularly get four to five good shaves.  </li>
            <li> New to the world of double edge razor shaving, I think these have been a good blade to start with.</li>
            <li> The two products are in the same class, but these Super Chromes have significantly better reviews.  </li>
            <li> Pretty economical if I do say so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember that pre-shave prep and good technique go a long way in making a particular blade / razor combo work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: If you have coarse hair and rough skin then, the Super Chromes will cost slightly more over time, but will provide a more consistently smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> a white dude with fair complexion and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean and seem to last along time.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m happy and a 100 blades will last me over a year for only $11.00-</li>
            <li> I prefer the super chrome over stainless but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The cost of these, particularly in bulk, is very attractive, especially against the cartridge razors so widely sold today.  </li>
            <li> Chrome blades come in a plastic container of five blades while the Super Stainless come in a paper container of five blades.</li>
            <li> And yes, I am an experienced wet shaver, use pre-shave oil, Taylor of Old Bond cream, etc.  </li>
            <li> After you get past the break in period these blades will give you many smooth, close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> I admire the purists that go that route, and in a way, it appeals to me, but there is a very real risk, no matter what anyone says, which is why my razor is called a \\&quot;safety razor\\</li>
            <li> Very well made sharp, like through case good when you travel.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints at all, and would strongly recommend them to anyone who has no previous experience with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> With little effort I learned to use the handle and these razors and get a shave as good as any I got from the triple blade name brand razor</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I found these to be relatively scratchy, blade after blade, they worked adequately if I did my part to make sure my beard was as friendly as possible by using very hot water and a quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I think this blade gives the most comfortable and clean shave of any I have used in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I&#x27;m very happy with these blades (my only other experience is with Wilkinson brand).</li>
            <li> Even with a clean blade, proraso sensitive skin cream right out of a hot shower i would get tugging followed by irritation</li>
            <li> About a week after my first DE shave</li>
            <li> the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first type of blade I tried were the Derby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I find these blades to be consistently scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I started using an old-fashioned safety razor to get away from modern, multi-blade razors that are mainly useful to the bank accounts of ad people and manufacturers.</li>
            <li> But They shaved better than german blades.</li>
            <li> Love them, will be shaving with these well into next year.</li>
            <li> With these blades, however, I am able to get a solid 2 pass shave that is quite close with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li> And by friday my face is pretty irritated from using them 5 days in a row.    </li>
            <li> They hold up pretty consistent during that time period.  </li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t fret if the first time you try a blade you don&#x27;t get the results you expect.  </li>
            <li> Blades can be pretty hit and miss.</li>
            <li> The quality is consistent.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love it.\\&quot;  Simply put, I just don&#x27;t have that lovin&#x27; feeling for these blades.  </li>
            <li> They shave as well as or better than the muti-blade razors and 100 Shark blades will last you for years.  </li>
            <li> I am able to get between 5 and 7 double shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> First shave and everything was as advertised and it worked well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;i will be the first to say.</li>
            <li> I actually use these for razoring and touching up my hair.</li>
            <li> It has consistent quality.</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> The blade actually works better after a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought 100 count, so these are gonna last me 50 months :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pack will last me 2 or so years then I will buy more again.</li>
            <li> Blades were shipped on time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> much better and cheaper than regular plastic rarzor shave!&lt;br /&gt;ill</li>
            <li> Having relied on others&#x27; reviews and safety razor shaving forums, I purchased these as my first refills.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference in shaving smoothness compared to the one razor blade that was included with my safety razor when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> For the first time my head looks like well shake bait</li>
            <li> I have been using single-blade safety razors for just over 2 years and have tried many different blades.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I first started using my Parker 82r with these blades because they come with the razor.</li>
            <li> All the brands I&#x27;ve tried are OK if you use the proper shaving form.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with any razor of any type in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> After trying several of the better razors out there I chose these Sharks.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; for your first pack.  </li>
            <li> The Shark blades feel like a higher quality metal than the Astras</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m assuming that you have tried these blades and others and decided that this is the brand and style for your mug.</li>
            <li> These blades have given me my first razor burn since I started shaving with a safety razor two years ago.</li>
            <li> Maybe the difference in the slightly higher price of the Chrome is the container, because for the life of me I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the shave efficiency or comfort --</li>
            <li> They seem to be shaving me OK.This the first time i ever used this type of razor blade.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a DE safety razor and this is my first set of blades</li>
            <li> The amazing part is that these blades actually last longer and give me as close and comfortable a shave as any I was getting with my former device.</li>
            <li> The Sharks have been my favorite blade since I have started using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> These blades for me, won&#x27;t last more than two shaves</li>
            <li> I tried 10-15 different blades before deciding on these, and I have been extremely satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li> These are not my favorite from the company, but still a very solid blade.</li>
            <li> Great price for long lasting blades.  </li>
            <li> My favorite 3, the ones in the running for a bulk (50-100) purchase are the Feathers, Gillette Silver Blue, and these.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I always get a better shave the second time around.</li>
            <li> I personally will not use the blade for more than 2 shaves.</li>
            <li> No point, these are better, last longer, and to me</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations and adequately replaces a Gillette Double Edge Razor that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> The third shave on this blade was worthless for me; Slicing up my face something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend these blades as a great product and a great buy, but they are so cheap; don&#x27;t sacrifice your face trying to maximize the life of your blades.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you&#x27;ll get an amazing blade, other times it will chew your face</li>
            <li> I can get a whole 3 pass shave in the second time, but need to keep re-wetting my face, much more than I do on the first shave.  </li>
            <li> nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I love these blades in my more aggressive DE razors and the price point is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good deal and gave me the opportunity to try several different blades.</li>
            <li> So far I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased with the shave these provide.  </li>
            <li> Always gives a great clean shave, be VERY careful when first using them they will slice you with little effort on a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> I shaved with Derby for about two years because I got a large pack without trying them first.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where all these positive reviews come</li>
            <li> They get dull really fast better off  buying blades from dollar store 10 times better</li>
            <li> , I got two years worth of shaves, assuming more or less 1 blade a week--some weeks maybe missing a shave ortwo, or taking good care of a blade</li>
            <li> They are menthol eucolyptus based and give your face a very cool refreshing feeling that last long after your shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got enough to last me quite awhile, so I&#x27;m glad that they give a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> pretty much got it done in 2 passes, even though I stuck with three.  </li>
            <li> I have used that for the past year and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used disposable razors in the past, but didn&#x27;t feel good about all of the plastic that was going into the landfill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They shaved me pretty good in both razors with only minor nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are every bit as comfortable as the not very sharp or close shaving Derbys.</li>
            <li> These are decent double edge razors but don&#x27;t expect more than a handful of shaves out of them if you have course/solid stubble.</li>
            <li> First couple shaves are great, but razors don&#x27;t stay sharp for too long.</li>
            <li> They do the job well and the smaller boxes make disposing of used razors easy.</li>
            <li> Five blades are held in an easy to open paper box.  </li>
            <li> I have strong facial hair (just like my opinions).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d certainly give these a try to see if they would work on your face.  </li>
            <li> No offense to the Shark blades intended, I certainly do like them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - honestly I am going to buy more when i need it, i may buy a few 100 packs so i dont have to order for a long while.</li>
            <li> : wet shaving is such a unique, independent experience for every individual, and just about any blade will be the very best one for someone.  </li>
            <li> Nice &amp; sharp... but not so sharp that it removes your top layers of skin (like feathers).</li>
            <li> First safety razor, and only blades I&#x27;ve used, so I have no basis for comparison, yet, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with these blades so far.</li>
            <li> Both do fine at getting at the large and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> 7am, after the shave, my face looks fine (the shave is close enough) after the Sharks, but there is a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 5 o&#x27;clock.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for the past year, and out of 15 other brands these are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I have no comparison, but they work fine for me and seem to last a while.</li>
            <li> I love these things paired with my Merkur Model 38 HD Classic Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> My go to blade before work, feel like it would be hard to cut myself but still get a really good shave.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge learning curve when learning how to switch to a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> I am 100% happy with this purchase, switching to shaving soap and a safety razor was a great decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;The number of shaves for each blade is insane, I have used 8 blades in a year!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s really a matter of opinion and really it depends on how you like shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving upward or &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; because i get irritated skin fast.</li>
            <li> These have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> and this product will allow you to have a very close shave...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades worked very well for me</li>
            <li> Really there is no contest between the two manufacturers.</li>
            <li> , I use them in a straight style razor.  </li>
            <li> But I still like the idea of getting a real close shave, every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought of going whole hog to a straight razor, but decided to make this baby step first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the time being, I&#x27;ve abandoned the idea of going for a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t figure there is much to gain, except for the $8/year savings on blades that I could avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one razor for a whole week, and it has treated me very well.</li>
            <li> At this price you could replace the blade every day and still not spend as much as you would with cartridges.</li>
            <li> Feathers being one of them) but really, the Sharks work well</li>
            <li> I really like these blades in my weishi</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and get a lot of</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li> They work very well for my face and in each of my razors.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the used-blade receptacle that comes with each 5 pack.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve used Shark&#x27;s stainless blades before I consider these to be a bit of an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> really close shaves before changing blades.</li>
            <li> not so much.  </li>
            <li> These blades give a really close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend these ones!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly between the very sharpest blades &#x27;Sharks and Feathers&#x27; Id have to say that Sharks shaved my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkurs and Lords also did very well tho</li>
            <li> Buy the chrome ones and not the stainless steel ones.</li>
            <li> These blades are made very well</li>
            <li> These are in boxes that include five razors, so no need to have the whole box on the counter.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> the Shark blade is a smoother shave and much sharper blade.</li>
            <li> but I cut myself a lot when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it is better to spend the extra few dollars for the better blades</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I like these blades.</li>
            <li> but I read that several of the reviewers said that using a double edged razor was more economical than using disposables.  </li>
            <li> so I was ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I received these blades in a sampler pack, and so far they are my second favorite blade in the pack</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face, razor, and technique is different, so a description of how closely these blades cut isn&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li> (my first choice being the Big Ben Super Chrome blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sharp and give a better shave with my 1920&#x27;s Gillette Safety razor than any of those modern 4/5 blade razors I used to use.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp and cheap!</li>
            <li> like many other people used the razor blade that came with the product.</li>
            <li> It is way better than paying the prices for the other type, but it takes time learning how to use this type of blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 5/1/2013: Am still using these, and stand by my original review (above).  </li>
            <li> I HAVE GOTTEN 6 SHAVES OUT OF MY FIRST BLADE WITH NO PROBLEMS WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY  FOR MORE EXPENSIVE BLADES</li>
            <li> For the cost I cant recommend any other blade delivering a better value.</li>
            <li> originally bought these blades to switch from multi-blade cartridge razors, because of razor burn on my neck that I have had my entire shaving life (15 years).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you sample blades before you buy a large quantity.</li>
            <li> very sharp and gives a good shave about the same as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> but people new to wet shaving &#x27;REALLY&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t use them OK as it does take a bit of practice.....</li>
            <li> I buy again, I&#x27;ll go for the Super Stainless and save a few of dollars since the container which holds the blades is not all that important to me.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine and for a long time (almost two weeks each blade).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the only other one I liked near as much were the Derby brand.</li>
            <li> My husband had been looking for a high quality product and these really fill the bill.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a Feather yet, but I find these Sharks to be quite sharp enough for my liking and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> i just used my first one, and its smooth and sharp, doesnt cause irritation.</li>
            <li> They cut smoothly, last longer than I expected, and clean easily under running water.  </li>
            <li> they are OK, XTG just average.  </li>
            <li> This purchase came fast and will save me the cost of the much more expensive razors you buy for $7, $10, or more at the store.</li>
            <li> I have a Feather Safety Razor and use Prorasor Shaving soap or sometimes Old Tayolors Almond shaving soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li> After years of lightweight disposable razors, I decided to return to the tried and true double edge razor blades</li>
            <li> These are great blades not super sharp but hold an edge for 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li> Just as good as all the new blades only cost you way less.</li>
            <li> But the Merkur blades I had been using previously worked better on me.</li>
            <li> I shaved first with the grain then against the grain with no nicks or cuts and I got a better shave than I usually do with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entertaining to read reviews of razor blades:  they either seem to be head and shoulders above all others, or total garbage...</li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome Double Edged Blades.</li>
            <li> The extra baggage that goes with straight razors isn&#x27;t worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> I can only get lucky to have one painless shave out of these blades.</li>
            <li> never go back to regular blade cartridges, this are much better.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, definitely will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> different faces prefer different blades so you might be better off trying a sampler pack</li>
            <li> i bring these blades in particular.</li>
            <li> have tried many brands, and the only ones that came &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to the same results were Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than today&#x27;s MORE expensive blades.</li>
            <li> The reviews were decent</li>
            <li> They are cheap, come very sharp and I normally only go through 1 blade per week, so this hundred pack will do me fine for almost two years.  </li>
            <li> not as keen as some others (feathers of course, and less so than astra SP or Personna blues), but smooth and consistent.  </li>
            <li> A good middle of the road blade, I find them tame and not to aggressive</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades.  </li>
            <li> though double-edged razors are highly hit-or-miss, I would recommend giving these a try.  </li>
            <li> i highly suggest getting into safety razors.</li>
            <li> They will pay for themselves and the high quality safety razor within the 1st year.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend you give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend for those safety razor users.</li>
            <li> Ample supply and high quality blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other blade reviews that suggest trying out different types for your own razor</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are sharp and great quality, they bundle means I don&#x27;t have to worry for a long time about getting replacement blades, especially at the pricing of cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheap but not in quality just in price, it is great quality and actually lasts at least 3 shaves while staying extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to buy the overly expensive stuff any more and the shave is just fine, thanks.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough for a good, clean shave but a little gentler than others.</li>
            <li> I have completely switched from cartridge to safety razors now with the exception of traveling since you are not allowed to take a straight edge blade on the plane.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money of quality blade.</li>
            <li> I could probably get a few more shaves per blade, but at 15 cents a piece, why bother?  </li>
            <li> Bought these to go with a razor and he has not complained yet.</li>
            <li> the kind of guy with a thick beard who has a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow 10 minutes after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Astra, the Feathers were only slightly noticeably better, and definitely not worth more than twice as much quite frankly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommednation</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t take to the \\&quot;modern technology\\&quot; that new razor styles offer.</li>
            <li> I define my beard texture as a coarse beard with skin that&#x27;s mild to moderately sensitive.</li>
            <li> its funny how old is new better way of shaving ill will never go back to disposable love</li>
            <li> brand blades, and a couple others, and quickly realized these blades are probably what you&#x27;d consider &amp;#34;middle-of-the-road.&amp;#34;  Other blades are sharper, but certainly others are not.  </li>
            <li> The others, like Derby, are fine, but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, I have only had one shave with these blades, so I cannot attest to their durability or consistency, but I had a four day&#x27;s growth on my face prior to the shave, and the blade cut through my whiskers just fine with no tugging or dragging.  </li>
            <li> really decent blade, like the Gillette Silver Blue for example, will take off close in the first swipe.</li>
            <li> No bloody tissues or any issues with being too sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, light and cut like a diamond edge.</li>
            <li> At the rate, this is the most economical mean to shave just short of a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and cheap in bulk.</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless</li>
            <li> Then they would soak me for the new model and replacement blades cost a fortune also.</li>
            <li> Then replacement blades for electrics cost as much as a new razor, or close to it.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t feel wasteful using a new blade every shave.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving</li>
            <li> My new blades cost just under $12.00 for 100.</li>
            <li> Because these razors cut more stubborn matter or hair off the face, they tend to dull much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Initial sharpness is close to mercur&#x27;s factory blades, however these do dull more quickly.</li>
            <li> I learned online that most of the blade \\&quot;wear\\&quot; is actually corrosion from putting a blade away wet.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I do go back and forth between cheap Barbasol from the local grocery store for about a buck (I use [[</li>
            <li> I also recommend them to my friends and family as i am trying to show them the way away from the carts and the crap that you buy in canada that isn&#x27;t safety razors or straight razors which is the best way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have posted, they do not stay sharp for long, but, even with thick whiskers, you can get one excellent shave from each side of a blade.</li>
            <li> note to newbies: DON&#x27;T press as hard as you do with &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; type razors or you&#x27;ll need a styptic pen :) If you have the right head on your razor(they are different btw) and get the angle right shaving with these is actually a pleasure.</li>
            <li> my only concern is that the used blades don&#x27;t fit back under the holders like on other DE blades I&#x27;ve gotten before, not a big problem if you have a razor safe for them, but its something I wanted to pass on.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades that stay sharp for at least 4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> For my first DE shave I lathered my face the same way I would with the Fusion and loaded a Shark blade into the razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought these with out doing my homework and by far these are the nicest blades yet!</li>
            <li> (still looks professional if you wear a tie!).</li>
            <li> But personally, I am thinking I&#x27;d like to try some other blades, maybe just because I can, and it makes things interesting.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why, 2nd order &amp; I might as well use the first batch of used blades.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> In the past I have payed more for duller blades by wilkinson sword.&lt;br</li>
            <li> oh and it stayed sharp enough for two more</li>
            <li> but I got these with an order I placed on Amazon and used the first and last one of these blades I will ever use.</li>
            <li> I found that this blade was the only one that gave me consistent, baby&#x27;s-butt-smooth, nick/burn-free shaves with a VARIETY of razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Can be flipped over (not sure if you get much more out of it this way</li>
            <li> The Feathers ( Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades), as another reviewer stated, lasted for more shaves, but were too sharp, often nicking my head and increasing the chances of repeat nicking.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> If I tried these first, I would have gone back to disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li> Some are prone to cause nicks on the first shave, and actually improve after being honed on you face (to the detriment of your face).</li>
            <li> Try a sampler pack (mixed brands) first, and then make your decision based on that.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure which are better.</li>
            <li> I was listening to the Howard Stern show and came upon a advertisment for the Dollar Shave Club, which interested me enough to do some research and read some reviews.  </li>
            <li> Astra (as good as the Feathers, for less than half the price)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they keep an edged thrugh a few shaves and better price even than the cheap ones which are getting harder to find at the local drug store</li>
            <li> The most comfortable and closest shaving of the three top blades I tried and the least expensive too boot,</li>
            <li> Give yourself a little luxury with the savings, and buy some pre-shave oil, a decent badger-hair brush, a worthwhile shaving cream/soap, and see how big a difference this makes for you.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Not only do these maintain their sharpness for a long time, they are smooth and leave your face feeling like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth long lasting blade.</li>
            <li> Cuts through the heavy stuff easily.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and seem to hold an edge longer than some other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried Shark, Derby ( sucked for me), Feather ( great but not worth it to me, slight step down IMO at a higher price tag.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much, only one other brand to compare to, but these seem better than the ones (Derby Extra) that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 100 count expected very consistent results.</li>
            <li> the first two shaves with a new blade in a long Mercury handle.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair like steel wool, most DE blades can get about half of my face done before they start nicking my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably only use these for quick WTG shaves, when time or laziness don&#x27;t allow for a proper shave.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I cannot tell the difference; both give a super shave and seem to last the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They provide a decent shave and are cheap enough to throw away after every other shave</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I use Proraso sensitive shave soap, an alum block, and Gillette sensitive after shave balm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not easy to see this when lookong at the box, but it is in fact suppposed to function easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d encourage anyone new to traditional wet shaving to buy a sampler pack first and try several different blades until they find one they feel comfortable with--but in light of the due diligence described above, I&#x27;ve decided that the Shark Super Chrome is definitely the blade for me.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, I shave daily 5 days a week and swap these out once a week which I am certain is overkill</li>
            <li> overall, I found the quality in some little packets to be better than others.</li>
            <li> These things are super sharp.</li>
            <li> I have kids at home and worry about them getting into the blades.the hard case served as a safe place to store the used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are super sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> Two of my sons now use a safety razor and these super sharp blades from Shark.  </li>
            <li> Now I Had Never Used Sharks Before As I Tend To Shun &#x27;Super Sharp&#x27; Blades.....</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well these blades work.  </li>
            <li> I looked like a 12 year old just learning how to shave.</li>
            <li> I would stay far away from these and grab some of the Personna or Wilkinson Sword Razors.</li>
            <li> They are shape but not like shave with a wild cat on a stick.</li>
            <li> They also seem to vary wildly from blade to blade.</li>
            <li> When it comes to razor blades you cant really recommend some to others because everyone has a different face and beard.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face and these turned out to be among the gentler blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I got mine at our local WalMart for much cheaper, with no shipping.  </li>
            <li> My husband has decided to go old school.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care if I only get one shave out of 30% of the blades and</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have an urge to explore further.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and they do not irritate my face.</li>
            <li> My beard is probably medium thickness (my Dad says it is thicker than his, but I&#x27;ve seen beards far thicker than mine).    </li>
            <li> Terrific blades and work very well.</li>
            <li> I have a course beard but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These blades give a very close shave but are forgiving enough for beginner shaver.  </li>
            <li> so at that rate I just bought blades for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some affordable razors to last the whole year</li>
            <li> If I had an old school shaver handle, I&#x27;d probably shave with these since they&#x27;re cheaper</li>
            <li> isnt really that coarse</li>
            <li> far as the blades go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can put the big box in storage and have a couple sitting out ready to go</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 20 years or so, and professionally for around 15 of them.  </li>
            <li> about 4 shaves per blades so far.</li>
            <li> One box of Shark blades has lasted me over a year so far.</li>
            <li> I have had really good shaves with sharks in the past and they do usually \\&quot;get the job done\\&quot; but there have been times when I have absolutely torn my face up with these things which I have NEVER done with a Feather.</li>
            <li> You get a over a year&#x27;s worth of shaving for such a low price!</li>
            <li> I read every where that it&#x27;s difficult to find a good blade for your skin and hair type, so I bought a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> These little blades are wicked sharp and last a good while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends who swear by these razors, but unless you have tough, leathery skin, and a fine, straight, normal beard</li>
            <li> I enjoy shark blades over feathers for there not so aggressive feeling yet sharp enough for up to 4 shaves and sometimes 5 or 6</li>
            <li> These are sharp, smooth, and a TERRIFIC value.  </li>
            <li> These blades are simply amazing (only when compared to any of the cartridge razors, as I have only bought these double edge safety razor blades I cannot compare these to any other brands)!</li>
            <li> super sharp, cuts through my stubble like a boss!</li>
            <li> These little babies were the result of a desire to cut down on cost, and it&#x27;s been a tremendously effective move.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy since making the switch to DE blades because they are so much less expensive than razor cartridges and I feel like they last longer.</li>
            <li> Big Ben was also a decent runner up.    </li>
            <li> Well worth the price, it will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> So the next time I was extremely careful and took my sweet time shaving.</li>
            <li> but the price was low enough that I was willing to try them out regardless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different kinds of blades now (Persona USA blue, and Shark Super Stainless were the other two).</li>
            <li> Really sharp yet forgiving, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that beginner Double Edge Safety Blade users give these a try.    </li>
            <li> This last year I discovered traditional wet shaving (for many of the same reasons that I&#x27;ve seen others articulate--cost, comfort, etc.), and bought a sampler pack that I found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a super smooth and close shave for mere pennies.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with these blades, for a super smooth shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;These razors are sharp, surprisingly long lasting, and provide a smooth, comfortable shave for considerably less than I had been spending.</li>
            <li> That said, I have absolutely no idea how anyone could provide a rating higher than a &#x60;3&#x27; for these blades.  </li>
            <li> tend to agree with earlier reviewers that these blades being a bit thin that they are only good for 3 or maybe 4 shaves before they should be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They come in convenient 5-blade packs, so you can just bring a few along on a trip, etc (also, it&#x27;s better than a box of 100 loose blades).</li>
            <li> I think I have found the combination of the right shaver, blade, pre-shave and shave soap that will keep me a double edge shaver for a very long time.</li>
            <li> They cut me a little on the first use and then actually work better after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Little to no irritation and a much closer shave for much much cheaper than gilletes cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and they shave fairly well even when I let the stubble grow in a little thicker than I probably should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other product my wife bought me was the 100 pack of the Shark Super Chrome blades which I did not initially use because I had the 5 Merkur blades that came with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> One end of the plastic box actually has a hinge that allow the whole end of the box to pop open.  </li>
            <li> So, when you do the math, the Feathers are at least equal in price and provide better shaves (one shave at $0.17 for Shark or two Feather shaves at $0.34).  </li>
            <li> it seems to me that one side of the blade will stick out just a bit more that the other side will so use the short side for general shaving and the long side of the blade for your last pass or your finish cut to get that</li>
            <li> Also, they irritated my face like no other.</li>
            <li> had always thought that the double-edge razor was something of a relic of the past, somewhere between the straight razor used in the old west and in barber shops, and the modern day electrics or Bic disposible types.  </li>
            <li> These get the job done like all the others I tried but there was one major difference that makes them my preferred blades.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp and consistent.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the merkur blades my razor came with but still plenty sharp and last more than a shave.</li>
            <li> I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior.</li>
            <li> The first shave i had with this blade, my beard growth was quite thick about 3 weeks of growth and the blade cut right through and only needed 2 passes,</li>
            <li> Good blades, thin and sharp..</li>
            <li> They dull up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> last remarks are that Shark Blades are really good blades and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try them, But just use a little care and common sense with something like this as they are really sharp but just keep in mind that other blades may work just a mite better in the long run is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff</li>
            <li> but still didn&#x27;t like it, and the Personna ones which weren&#x27;t too bad but weren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> for over 3 years now, and have been shaving in general for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> Though I do not have a precision caliper to measure the blades, I am pretty sure I ran across a five pack that protruded too far from the razor and gave me some unpleasant cuts.</li>
            <li> Going with an old fashioned razor over the double and triple edge blades has saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> They work well, about as well as Derbys, although those are the only 2 brands I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> They are the sharpest and longest lasting ones I have had so far.</li>
            <li> So decided to try the old fashion style Double Edge Safety Razor bought one here on Amazon along with \\&quot;100</li>
            <li> The old double edged razor takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> I can say that so far, I&#x27;m into the second week with this blade, and it still seems to shave quite well, with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> With the second shave with the shark blades I fixed my technique and  had not cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on multiple cartridges for my old razor</li>
            <li> These are for manly men who can &#x27;rasle a bear with their bare hands so beware.  </li>
            <li> , well I actually learned with a gillette way bac in the early 70&#x27;s then switched to an Atra for 30 plus years.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my facial hair</li>
            <li> These in my razor give me the closest shave without any nicks or cuts and just glides through my whiskers and this just using regular old shaving cream in a can..</li>
            <li> After the first swipe, the shave was rough and left stubble behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I could make this blade work, and it is better than a cartridge razor, but I would be compromising and putting up with some unnecessary cuts and redness.</li>
            <li> I shave 3 times a week and do notice a very slight degradation in performance on the third shave with the blades, but nothing major, simply meaning that the third pass is somewhat more necessary.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty sharp!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a cheaper option that going with the new fancy cartridge razors and blades at $18+ for only a pack of eight blades!</li>
            <li> I am new to double edge shaving  and purchased a sample assortment I only used one or these blades and I am throwing the rest away the razor iI</li>
            <li> I typically get two weeks worth of shaves out of this razor when I was getting only one with all the others.</li>
            <li> Very sharp I got 5 shaves from the first blade</li>
            <li> After the first shave, I thought, maybe I was just too used to my previous brand</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, last for several shaves and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Even following the guidelines that I saw on the videos, of steaming my face with a hot wet towel for 5 minutes before shaving and just using the weight of the razor, I was getting nicks and irritation, especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li> A good compromise between the ultra sharpness but short life of some blades, and the long life but questionable edge of others.</li>
            <li> Remember, a dull blade is more dangerous than a sharp one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the blade is sharper it will last more shaves, so the extra money you&#x27;re paying for these blades will more than ever out than if you bought cheaper less sharper ones.</li>
            <li> The average life of the blades is pretty much the same as other blades and these are the hardest blades to get out of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> There are some important principles that customers must understand before seriously considering this review:    1)</li>
            <li> I grow just enough stubble to annoy my girlfriend, but not enough for most blades to get on a daily basis without shaving against the grain and risking serious skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> At the same time I was trying out several different razors (from a contemporary Merkur to several pre-WWII vintage Gillette razors), so each blade was used in a variety of razors.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine  how much I have spent on blades for my Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> I figured each would last as long as a cartridge does for a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is somewhat sensitive, I have always found myself wanting for a shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and leave those tiny red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different blades, and keep coming back to Sharks Super Chrome...</li>
            <li> am new to the single blade</li>
            <li> This little razor might not be what you expect at first.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely durable.</li>
            <li> I have used them on five different occasions, and no matter how much prep, and how careful I am, I end up with a face full of nicks and cuts, and I mean a lot.  </li>
            <li> They are so much cheaper than other disposable blades and will probably last me for a couple years.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they&#x27;re dull or what, but they pull hair and require multiple passes to get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Just use caution for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> Shark blades are thick and sharp enough to make them very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This blade is incredibly smooth and gives a great shave, except when you get to the chin and around the nose, then it feels clumsy, awkward, and a little risky for cuts.</li>
            <li> Second time buying these blades, first set of 100 lasted me a little over a year</li>
            <li> I was using Feather blades and they did well for the most part, but sometimes left me a little raw on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works very well very sharp</li>
            <li> New to DE community so not much experience in this area</li>
            <li> I snap them in half and use with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say if another brand would cut less</li>
            <li> The amount of money you save on buying a years supply of Sharks vs a years supply of the \\&quot;hi tech\\&quot; pieces of crap advertised by the TV models will pay for your nice razor in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the last disposable I was using the 5 blade Gillette Proglide with the vibrating handle seemed to work fairly well for me, I took notice of the fact that the replacement blades were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Maybe everyone should slow down and realize that shaving can be enjoyable.</li>
            <li> They are definitely the sharpest blades I have used and to avoid cuts I put very little pressure on the razor and swipe nice and slow, going with the hair, along the grain.  </li>
            <li> I just never really paid much attention to how long my blade was lasting before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too sharp but not dull.</li>
            <li> Prior to using a DE safety razor, I used the BIC single blade sensitive skin razors exclusively.</li>
            <li> The shave was OK, but When I went to buy new blades, I was shocked to see that each blade cost nearly $4!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That was the tipping point.  </li>
            <li> After slamming the poor packaging of the otherwise fine Shark blade, I have discovered how the packaging is designed to work.  </li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp long enough for me to replace them once every two weeks, and I do a WHOLE lot of shaving.     </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this little blade could do so much.</li>
            <li> Without getting too scientific, the difference in the Super Chrome&#x27;s lie in the blades ability to cut through very small bits of stubborn matter on the face.  </li>
            <li> To trim down on the cost, I decided to try a new approach, and invest in a different razor.</li>
            <li> As sharp as the blades are though, no need to change them that frequently.</li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;ve all been sharp</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised by how sharp they are.  </li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and previously used the Gillette Fusion with Col. Conk Bay Rum and an Omega badger brush.  </li>
            <li> really like the plastic box the packs come in because there is a small slot at the back to store your used razor blades.</li>
            <li> I thought they would only last one shave, but they do a couple (depending on how long you grow out your beard/stubble).</li>
            <li> Since I use one of these double edged razors per week, these are going to last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I only have to shave twice a week, but what hair I do have to shave is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Not sharp on tip or corners but sharp in the middle.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying 12.00 for 5 gillette mach 3 blades at my local drugstore that would dull pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Husband usually uses a straight razor but wanted to have a razor with blades to use when we travel.</li>
            <li> I paired these blades with my Parker 99R - long handle double edge razor.</li>
            <li> After one shave I can&#x27;t say anything on how long the sharpnest will last.</li>
            <li> Rather long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time also</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 30 years and have bounced back between various disposable razors and have spent the money on various electrics.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the hair I do have to shave is rather thick and after going against the grain with this blade after my first two passes, it was a delight to shave with.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick stubble and these hang up in it.</li>
            <li> I find the shave to be slightly smoother, and I usually get a few more shaves out of the chromes before they go dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gathered that it must be that sometimes the sharks are a somewhat inconsistent and a whole lot less sharp than the feather blades consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a rough Mediterranean beard, and tried about 8 or so different brands before finally Settling on Shark.</li>
            <li> the second and third uses feeling a bit rough.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched back to wet shaving</li>
            <li> there sharp with no drag and durable 3-4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to blame the blade for being a little hard on my face, because there are a lot of other factors that go into a satisfying wet shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched back to shaving with a safety razor due to the incomprehensible cost of cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li> SO sharp that you&#x27;ll unknowingly slice your finger open when trying to wipe off some extra shaving cream.</li>
            <li> facial hair is very course and usually dulls out blades like fusion and carts alike within the first shave depending on how thick the beard growth is and im not talking about it being thick at all.</li>
            <li> As noted by many other reviewers, these blades will cut you because they are extremely thin and sharp (imagine that!)  </li>
            <li> One complaint is that they put too much glue on the blade to make it stick to the wax paper, this tends to end up in your razor, gumming it up a bit</li>
            <li> so much better than the crazy prices for the mach..</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, if your a beginner I suggest a long handle safty razor and quality time with your self in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I found my fathers old safety razor a few weeks ago and thought I would give these blades a try.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> They where just to harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But, so long as I change them once a week I get a close shave for 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and bought a Merkur Model 180 (long) safety razor -</li>
            <li> hear the Feather razors have the sharpest blade but with the drawback of needed to be extra careful when shaving so as not to nick yourself.  </li>
            <li> the edge does not hold quite as long as I would like it</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert to wet shaving and do not have any issues with razor burn (unlike the Merkur blades) and have yet to cut my throat with them.</li>
            <li> However, as with every razor blade I have used, I do have a bit of stubble left over under my chin and on my neck requiring a careful once over.</li>
            <li> Not a lifetime but a heck of a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> As I bought a pack of 100, he will be using these for long time.</li>
            <li> I shave every day (military) and these blades last for about a week each.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this $12 box of razor blades for a ridiculously long time.</li>
            <li> Got tired of constantly buying a new razor only to find a year later</li>
            <li> I have a heavy stubble and can dull blades quickly.  </li>
            <li> With either BIC or Feather blades I can get 4-6 close, smooth shaves with much less irritation, all the while getting less nicks and cuts because sharper blades glide smoother across my face with less pressure (hence there is less nicks).</li>
            <li> Saving with a new blade every other shave is like living in the lap of luxury!!!</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I found that these do not last as long as other razors that I have used</li>
            <li> I cut myself multiple times because I always forget how sharp these are.</li>
            <li> I switch to a safety double edge razor after giving up shaving due to all kinds troubles with razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am on my 5th day using the same blade and it is still quite sharp.</li>
            <li> The edge of the 7AM&#x27;s will glide over small stubborn matter more frequently rather than cutting through it.</li>
            <li> The Sharp blades were second</li>
            <li> If you lift the lip of the package while sliding a blade open, the little door will pop open.  </li>
            <li> : They only stay sharp for about a week for me.</li>
            <li> Other blades I&#x27;ve used only lasted 2.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-They are sharp on both sides (hence the double edge)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do the job, but you can&#x27;t compare to Feather Razor Blades, they are not as sharp but the price is not the same!.</li>
            <li> Made by the Lord Shaving company, who also makes several other brands I use.</li>
            <li> After every shave (I shave every other day, and only my neck as I maintain a beard) I thoroughly dry the blade and the razor before storing.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these (though my experience with other brands is limited).</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and if you have a thick beard they really get a close shave after only 2 passes.</li>
            <li> Use a blow dryer to dry the blade while it is still in the razor.  </li>
            <li> These blades can be used over and over again if you remove them from the razor and dry them off after use.</li>
            <li> but a pack of blades this big unless you have tried a few as every blade is different for every guy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My previous blades were Feather Hi-Stainless and they were packaged in a plastic box that was wrapped with infuriating clear plastic film that I could not open quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of buying electric razors, and having them last only a year or so, and worse yet, they only give a super close shave for a month or so before it is at the point where it only \\&quot;basically just does the job\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor bumps for a long time and some of the blades I tried felt too dull and all of the force required for me to get a decent shave left my face a bit raw and left me with some bumps.</li>
            <li> Some blades, however, have a tough time on the first shave.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, I have used multi-blade razors for years and got tired of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a single blade be damaged out of the package.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these in place of some very expensive disposable razors she used to like, and likes these much better.  </li>
            <li> My wife got me a new safety razor for Christmas since I was disgusted with using disposables of all types (how many Machs are there?!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with blades, and can only go buy a previous reviewer&#x27;s trials.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve started painstakingly taking the blade out after rinsing, and carefully trying to dry it.  </li>
            <li> I change the blades every time I feel I need to, and still have over half the value pack left!  </li>
            <li> Last longer and less nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed with the first shave I had with this blade.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t seem to do well with the tiny bumps and rough spots on an average guy&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> These blades are not for a quick and careless shave.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these things are like 10 cents each.i feel like an idiot for buying cartridges for $3-$4 each that lasted two weeks at best!with these things it costs like 50 cents a month at MOST!</li>
            <li> They are far far sharper which leads to less razor burn but more chance of those nasty slices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a little extra and get the Feather blades if these don&#x27;t work for you, your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the fact they are individually packaged which makes opening a box of razor blades a little safer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> but with a little tug...and ALWAYS end up leaving razor burn and moderate irritation.</li>
            <li> They come in these little plastic holder that each holds 5 wrapped blades and on the back you can stick your used blades into it also.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m taking off a star because they crashed the packaging.the blades are in paper packaging rather than the hard plastic the old ones came in.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat nearly 2/3 of a year shaving for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> During the second shave, I can tell the blade is starting to dull and starts to tug on my beard.  </li>
            <li> If your primary concern is fear of cutting yourself, let me assuage your sense of hesitation:</li>
            <li> With these blades, I have yet to complete a shave without nicking myself at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the expensive double and Triple razors they keep coming out with!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got enough of them to last at least a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> These will probably last me for another five years, but I&#x27;m not an everyday shaver, so that number will vary on how often you shave.</li>
            <li> I only shave a few times a week and go for the rugged look in between</li>
            <li> Be careful it is easier to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry to get two years worth of shaves, and don&#x27;t want to do a bunch of testing and research, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Shark blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and they last about 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
            <li> Too rough.  </li>
            <li> Be careful on</li>
            <li> These blades are rough on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a sampler pack before buying bulk.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gone through about 80 of these blades and have discovered that the quality varies quite widely.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I am these blades</li>
            <li> be careful this blade will cut you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how careful you are and what type of blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, when my shave gets uncomfortable, or not close enough, I just change out a blade that costs pennies, and it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I would like them to have been.</li>
            <li> Heres a link to a review from my favorite shaving forums: [...] Shark...-Oh-the-Shark-has-some-fine-shaves-dear  </li>
            <li> I tried three other blades before I picked these.</li>
            <li> - I could probably go longer between changes, but this way I never have to wonder whether my razor blade is going to be sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are wicked sharp but they are also flimsy and don&#x27;t hold up to changes in the grain or curves in the skin.</li>
            <li> Try the other blades before you order a 100 count for any type of blades..</li>
            <li> They are sharp, but not to sharp like the Feather Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> will echo all the other rave reviews on these blades, and endorse them as well.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, but not to sharp like the Feather Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> I will echo all the other rave reviews on these blades, and endorse them as well.</li>
            <li> The blades are not that sharp but they are sharp enough to cut without pulling on the hairs and i can usually get about 4 shaves on a blade.</li>
            <li> Also flipping the blade to the other side after each shave will prolong the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried other blade</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and sharp.</li>
            <li> Seems to be not as sharp as Chromium blades..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands, so I can&#x27;t speak to how these perform compared to others.</li>
            <li> There are some other blades I&#x27;d like to try (</li>
            <li> gave these blades a five star rating because the rating system didnt go into the diamonds (usually seen in hotels that bill gates goes to) and these will be my goto blades for the next 60-80 years</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not so sharp that they irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Is it cheaper than other, sharper blades?</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as the Merkur or Feather blades (those are &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34; lined while the Sharks are &#x27;chrome&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades and close shave every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some flimsy, low quality blades in the past.  </li>
            <li> Even the extremely sharp Feather blades didn&#x27;t have the propensity to nick the way these do.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp for about 4 or 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades close shave with these.</li>
            <li> They seem sharp and do the job.</li>
            <li> Every other Blade I use cuts up my face or just doesnt cut at all.</li>
            <li> Shark is sharp but maybe not the smoothest.</li>
            <li> He said these Shark razors just aren&#x27;t as sharp.  </li>
            <li> The Shark blades are still quite sharp, but don&#x27;t nick.  </li>
            <li> I was using the sharp blades but these seem to be \\&quot;sharper\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp but not well honed.</li>
            <li> I got two boxes of these, one to go with my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day shaving set, and the other to go with my dad&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this for other razors.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp be carrful.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but tough as Iron beard hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I find is that the design of the handle when wet, because of its weight, becomes hard to grip while using it.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought some blades at CVS and they sucked because they either were too thick or weren&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>
            <li> They start out a little too sharp, but they last quite a few shaves and cut away even fluffy stubble.</li>
            <li> But after using them I found that you need to use such a tiny amount of the product for a single shave that it wasn&#x27;t really expensive at all.  </li>
            <li> I did cut myself, however, I believe it was because of previous experiences with other blades.</li>
            <li> I have found these to be less sharp than others.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have for the Shark blades is that they irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I have a thin beard (I am young and still in college) and had about four days growth on it.  </li>
            <li> It sure beats the crap out of paying for Mach III cartridges, though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push or bear down.</li>
            <li> but I think time will improve as I get the technique down.</li>
            <li> So, that makes 99 razors down the tube and another purchase of Feather razors.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t yet mention other companies, but have come to the conclusion, it isn&#x27;t the razor, I use a safety razor, it&#x27;s the blade that makes the shave!</li>
            <li> Those blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, and do give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Like I said, very sharp, so use with care.</li>
            <li> These babies are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> These were included in that pack along with Derby&#x27;s, BIC Chrome, Sharp, Astra and a few others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried these blades and a few other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 years and tried a few other brands</li>
            <li> I typically will get 3 to 5</li>
            <li> I purchased these about a year and a half ago, so I have been shaving with them for some time.  </li>
            <li> I typically shave my head also, so I was a bit reluctant to try a safety razor again.  </li>
            <li> I use them with my Jack Black safety razor made by Muhle.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s silly to rely on a review to make a decision on such a personal item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this brand of razor blades but figured I could take a chance since the package of 100 was less than $9.00.  </li>
            <li> but I can shave in half the time with these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year and a half and neither of them are close to the end of their box.  </li>
            <li> I have used these particular blade for about five years now and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Other blades (Feather brand in particular) were a bit too sharp and I could feel them cutting a little too close and leaving me with bumps.</li>
            <li> Do not go against the grain of hair growth on the first pass or you will end up cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> the Lords proved a bit difficult to seat properly in my new Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I believe I can skimp a little in this area.</li>
            <li> I just used the little pop-up on the star rating and it says four stars is \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; whereas five stars is</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about picking up 100 blades all at once, considering I had never used the Shark blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a little over a year, I no longer have any razor burn on my neck.</li>
            <li> The initial impression is that this little thin piece of metal won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> They are quite dull and are not even remotely close to a Feather blade (or even a Merkur).  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with disposable and electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using exclusively DE safety razor blades exclusively for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need another razor for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Found myself missing the Sharks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them because I  don&#x27;t want to waste the money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Shark makes a razor that would hold these differently, or if they are just poor quality.</li>
            <li> I do not shave everyday since it&#x27;s not important to my field of work.</li>
            <li> Bought these a few months ago and have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> and I am going to give these a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> ordered the Parker 99 heavy weight and it came with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few that have not arrived yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself an overly harsh rater.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy beard</li>
            <li> FEW TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a course beard and need to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Try a few types and see what works.</li>
            <li> They do give me a close shave, but are just a little less forgiving than others I&#x27;ve tried when I get lazy with my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who are novice to the trade a suggestion: you should apply less pressure than usual or else you may cut you skin.</li>
            <li> I bet I have saved $200 not buying those expensive 5-blade, turbo charged, slime injected major brand blades that need replaced weekly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The inconsistencies basically meant I was looking worse on some days after I shaved with this instead of compared to my previous disposable head razor.</li>
            <li> One blade last at least a week on my tough beard.</li>
            <li> It was worse than dry</li>
            <li> Take your time, use very little pressure and you should make it out without losing any blood.</li>
            <li> No more rashes or breaking out.  </li>
            <li> With DE blades and razors YMMV, but these are blades definitely not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after extensive testing, these Sharks just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> I switched over to these for the past month.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it&#x27;s working or not, but you can research/Google that yourself.  </li>
            <li> not much more i can say.</li>
            <li> I tend to have heavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> that Gillete Mack 100, quaduple blade, self lathering, clogged up with whiskers, waste of money!</li>
            <li> Bought a double edged razor to save money on expensive razor refills.  </li>
            <li> get 10 days out of a blade( I have a medium heavy beard and shave at least once a day)</li>
            <li> I rarely review products so that should tell you how much I hate these blades.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the job ended up the same.  </li>
            <li> Bruce LOVES this product, so sorry he did not go back to this type of razor sooner.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband because we have been having a difficult time finding his locally.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to be very thin and lays close to my face, so I have to go over it several times, however with these blades</li>
            <li> They seem very harsh and unflexing.</li>
            <li> I read some things online regarding DE safety razors and how they would reduce the tug and pull of the disposable razors I commonly used in the past.  </li>
            <li> They are also less expensive and are less risky on the face (fewer cuts) and the shave is not as close</li>
            <li> But the Shark blades are thin and very sharp for a painless shave.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, they pull too hard on my beard and make it feel like I&#x27;m pulling them out by their roots.</li>
            <li> The shaving experience feels like you&#x27;re dragging a dull metal strip across your skin.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not true then don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this mass amount as you&#x27;ll be a sad mac if your chin and these blades disagree.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin reacted negatively after the shave.</li>
            <li> I use them in a Futur at the least aggressive setting and have no problem with cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a complaint.  </li>
            <li> They work well for me, and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen varieties.</li>
            <li> I got these blades in a sample pack [[ASIN:B004UIZFQW 35 FEATHER 7 O&#x27;clock SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD DERBY Blade Sampler]] and have had a chance to try all of them at least twice.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering, there was nary a complaint from the steak after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1000 blades will cover my shaving needs for at least two decades if not longer.</li>
            <li> I started out with slow even strokes</li>
            <li> These blades are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I decided to switch to this style if razor after growing tired of spending excessive amounts of money on multibladed platforms that irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I never get a close enough shave and they pull and tug really bad because they&#x27;re so dull.</li>
            <li> but here it&#x27;s a ridiculously priced).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the ridiculous cost of cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Like the price cost less than those expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I began shaving with all the products listed above and was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but the cut is very dull.</li>
            <li> They are very dull.</li>
            <li> but I found that I was getting unnecessary nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank these  under astras and definitely under feathers.</li>
            <li> B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL]]</li>
            <li> I got tired of the price</li>
            <li> Shaving with these Sharks leaves my face smoother than Kate Upton&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> So far these are one of the worst blades I have used.</li>
            <li> wrong with the quality of the Shark blades I suppose,</li>
            <li> I was almost sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> If you are that person that needs the mere resemblance of a shave and will not be critiqued, then go for the 7AM&#x27;s or something comparable.  </li>
            <li> They are not the blades for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and I got a lot of pulling and tugging and my shave was rather uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I prefer the butterfly razors versus the ones you have to remove the head to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;On razors: I bought a Parker and the guide was wrong for my beard.</li>
            <li> If this seems to be an inadequate number of shaves, I would like to hear from others and have them tell me what I am doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong, if you like these blades, and I do.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Turns out, I was horribly wrong.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I mean, chopped beef bad.  </li>
            <li> the blades are very thin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other blades and have been very disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> The biggest surprise though is that although they&#x27;re not quite as sharp (awfully close to it though)</li>
            <li> Does that mean they are bad blades, dull as a rock, the worst product ever to visit your medicine cabinet?  </li>
            <li> just keep cutting my skin instead of my stubble.</li>
            <li> The razors are also in protective envelopes, so there is no risk in accidentally cutting yourself while removing a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy as she heard me watching these videos, but in the end I decided to order a Merkur 38C razor along with a Van Der Hagen Shave Kit from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to shave with these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to shave with a weekends growth.    </li>
            <li> A bad combo for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t see the four stars as a bad rating in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad Move.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad blades, but consistency seems to be an issue....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, things took a bad turn about halfway through the 100 pack.</li>
            <li> I bought a package of 200 and disappointed that I did.</li>
            <li> Respect it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in these razors.  </li>
            <li> I hate these blades.</li>
            <li> Very Bad.</li>
            <li> I tried the Merkur blade that came with the razor and got a terrible shave.  </li>
            <li> The worst shave I&#x27;ve ever given myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these sharks for a couple months now and they are awful blades.</li>
            <li> not the worst but for another 5 bucks</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of blades in my time and I have to say these blades were the very worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price. Great shaving blade. What more could you want? As with any blade, YMMV. For me these work great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and provide a smooth shave. Great bargin.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. No issues.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I would like them to have been. But that&#x27;s really a matter of opinion and really it depends on how you like shave. It honestly take more than 3 passes for me but i realize I don&#x27;t shave the same as others. I don&#x27;t like shaving upward or &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; because i get irritated skin fast. So i just shave downward and diagonal. I&#x27;m on to my quest for a blade that suits me better.</li>
            <li> Terrific! Terrific!  I highly recommend these blades.  Going with an old fashioned razor over the double and triple edge blades has saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Good razors. They do the job well and the smaller boxes make disposing of used razors easy. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Shark super chrome razor blades give me a close and comfortable shave with no razor burn and one blade will last a full week which makes them a great value also.</li>
            <li> These have worked really well for me.  I typically will get 3 to 5 shaves out of a blade.  The shaves are close and comfortable.  I don&#x27;t know how you beat them for the price.  I expect it will be a couple of years before I need to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I cut myself multiple times because I always forget how sharp these are. Use with caution! also Go with the grain, and then against for best results.</li>
            <li> Best blade I have ever used !!</li>
            <li> Good razors especially for the price. Only having 5 in a pack and not 10 is kind of a nuisance. Having to go through packs quicker.</li>
            <li> A blade is a blade??? No!! I&#x27;m still experimenting with blades, and can only go buy a previous reviewer&#x27;s trials. I won&#x27;t yet mention other companies, but have come to the conclusion, it isn&#x27;t the razor, I use a safety razor, it&#x27;s the blade that makes the shave!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Merkur model 180 that came with a Merkur blade along with some shark blades.  I am new to DE shaving and previously used the Gillette Fusion with Col. Conk Bay Rum and an Omega badger brush.  For my first DE shave I lathered my face the same way I would with the Fusion and loaded a Shark blade into the razor.  I have a thin beard (I am young and still in college) and had about four days growth on it.  I shaved first with the grain then against the grain with no nicks or cuts and I got a better shave than I usually do with the Fusion.  I was really surprised at how well these blades work.  About a week after my first DE shave I tried the Merkur blade that came with the razor and got a terrible shave.  I threw the Merkur blade away and put in a Shark blade and got a wonderful shave.  Great blades, though I probably should have tried a smaller package.</li>
            <li> The Shark razor blades represent a tremendous value.  My husband said they gave him a superior shave to the Merkur blades that came with his safety razor and they cost a fraction of the price.  At the price Shark charges, he&#x27;s more than happy to swap in new blades after only 2 shaves to ensure that each shave has a nearly pristine blade.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and cheap! The hubs loves these.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Parker 22 DE safety razor, came with ten blades, so I ordered enough for the year!  This blade is great for the beginner DE shaver, very sharp and gives you closest shave you have ever experienced compared to a store bought, five blade, typical brand name razor.  Great sharp blade, will buy again!</li>
            <li> These blades came with the Parker 91r, that I ordered last March. I had a learning curve issue with them and went to the Wilkinson&#x27;s from Walmart.  I went back to them and have had great shaves ever since.</li>
            <li> I suppose there&#x27;s no one best blade for everyone, but these do not give me the best shave. I had a better experience with the Astra Platinum that came as a sample pack with the razor or the Dorco&#x27;s I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with the quality of the Shark blades I suppose, I just feel these are not the best for me.</li>
            <li> I only have to shave twice a week, but what hair I do have to shave is pretty thick. I was using Feather blades and they did well for the most part, but sometimes left me a little raw on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel the Shark razors are as sharp as Feathers, and for me, this is a good thing. It takes me more than one pass to get all the stubble. The Feathers would get all the stubble, but take a lot of my skin with it. The Sharks get all the stubble as well, but don&#x27;t leave my neck cut up like the Feathers sometimes did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the price is great. If you&#x27;re not shaving barbed wire off your face every couple days, I think these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to have some sort of coating which gives a much&lt;br /&gt;smoother shave than other blades I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with the Shark blades.</li>
            <li> Lot of blades, but they only work one time for me</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money, and nice to have a supply fo a while. Works great with my Merker razor.</li>
            <li> Bought these and have been using them for about a month.  They work well, about as well as Derbys, although those are the only 2 brands I&#x27;ve tried so far.  One complaint is that they put too much glue on the blade to make it stick to the wax paper, this tends to end up in your razor, gumming it up a bit but it is fairly easy to wipe away.</li>
            <li> Great blades, great price!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much ! Have a nice day !</li>
            <li> they are as advertized--great price</li>
            <li> Solid, good valued blade. Good balance of sharpness and comfort. No razor sting. Good beginner and experienced DE shaver blade.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and will allow you to have a very close shave.  I shave 3 passes each time I shave; (with, across, against) and this product will allow you to have a very close shave...the first time.  During the second shave, I can tell the blade is starting to dull and starts to tug on my beard.  I can get a whole 3 pass shave in the second time, but need to keep re-wetting my face, much more than I do on the first shave.  The third shave on this blade was worthless for me; Slicing up my face something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend these blades as a great product and a great buy, but they are so cheap; don&#x27;t sacrifice your face trying to maximize the life of your blades.</li>
            <li> They are the sharpest and longest lasting ones I have had so far.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the 10 star button? These blades are unbelievable! Just use caution for the first few shaves. These things are super sharp. After you get past the break in period these blades will give you many smooth, close, comfortable shaves. My current record is forty five, three pass shaves out of one blade. I was almost sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> I have tried Derby and Astra blades but these Sharks take the cake. The first type of blade I tried were the Derby&#x27;s but I found that I was getting unnecessary nicks and razor burn. I soon switched to Astra which felt a lot smoother and reduced my razor burn tremendously but my skin reacted negatively after the shave. I just got done with my first shave using the sharks and my skin feels great, no razor burn whatsoever.  I highly recommend that beginner Double Edge Safety Blade users give these a try.    Heres a link to a review from my favorite shaving forums: [...] Shark...-Oh-the-Shark-has-some-fine-shaves-dear  Badger and blade has a wealth of information available including a long list of reviews and an excellent community of knowledgeable shavers.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right to the nub of it:  I find these blades to be consistently scratchy.  Does that mean they are bad blades, dull as a rock, the worst product ever to visit your medicine cabinet?  Of course not.  Would I recommend against them?  Well, I&#x27;d recommend that anyone who uses a double-edge razor to try a variety of blades and stick with what works best for that user.  It&#x27;s entertaining to read reviews of razor blades:  they either seem to be head and shoulders above all others, or total garbage... depending on the reviewer.  Which is the point: wet shaving is such a unique, independent experience for every individual, and just about any blade will be the very best one for someone.  The trick is finding out if this one is for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:  I got these in bulk before trying them out, and I&#x27;m still glad I did.  Despite the fact that I found these to be relatively scratchy, blade after blade, they worked adequately if I did my part to make sure my beard was as friendly as possible by using very hot water and a quality shave cream.  If I did my part, then, the shaving experience was never horrible... just not optimal.  I don&#x27;t regret my decision to buy these in bulk because they represent a fair ripper of a deal and give a decently close shave.  I&#x27;m not going to blame the blade for being a little hard on my face, because there are a lot of other factors that go into a satisfying wet shaving experience.  They do give me a close shave, but are just a little less forgiving than others I&#x27;ve tried when I get lazy with my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d certainly give these a try to see if they would work on your face.  I&#x27;d also try a lot of others, too. If money is tight, I would try one or two sample packs to get an idea of what works best, but you should try 5 - 10 blades, in my opinion, to get the best feel over time for what is going to give you the most comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is three stars uncharitable?  Perhaps, as I do think these blades are OK (for me) and they certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.ey certainly do represent huge value for the bulk price, but four stars would be a bit much from my experience.</li>
            <li> I started using an old-fashioned safety razor to get away from modern, multi-blade razors that are mainly useful to the bank accounts of ad people and manufacturers. I don&#x27;t need them. These blades cut smoothly for three to five days, which is all I ask. I don&#x27;t have to buy the overly expensive stuff any more and the shave is just fine, thanks.</li>
            <li> These blades are great for the Parker Safety Razor I had purchased.  They&#x27;d probably be just as good for any other razor.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp long enough for me to replace them once every two weeks, and I do a WHOLE lot of shaving.     I shave my head and face, so it works out to be an amazing value and a great shave every time.    I tried three other blades before I picked these. The fact that they are so cheap makes them even more attractive.    I use the Merkur 34C and they go great together!</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a DE blade and I&#x27;m really glad that I read the reviews for these blades, for 17cents a piece I&#x27;m jumping for joy over here.  Smooth and no nicks great!</li>
            <li> These blades have worked well for me.  I get a nice shave, and they each blade lasts for 2-3 shaves.  Works out to be way cheaper than giving all my money to Gillette.</li>
            <li> First couple shaves are great, but razors don&#x27;t stay sharp for too long. I will be going back to Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> I have a rough Mediterranean beard, and tried about 8 or so different brands before finally Settling on Shark. They lasted the longest of any blade without pulling or irritation. Big Ben was also a decent runner up.    That being said I&#x27;d strongly recommend to all that you buy a sampler pack of different brands (there are some here on amazon) and see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li> These give me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: if you are used to the offerings of Gick or Schillette, start cautiously. Don&#x27;t push or bear down. Just let the blade glide over your face under its own weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a safety razor. Google and Amazon will help you find one. Buy a good one. It will easily pay for itself, because these blades are so cheap. I like to change my blade every week - I could probably go longer between changes, but this way I never have to wonder whether my razor blade is going to be sharp. So at my rate of usage, this box of 100 is a two-year supply. Don&#x27;t think because it&#x27;s cheap that it can&#x27;t be good.  My theory is that the profit margin on these is too low for them to command shelf space in the stores.</li>
            <li> The worst shave I&#x27;ve ever given myself. I have fine hair but the grain of my beard is funky around my chin. On top of that I also have sensitive skin . These blades are wicked sharp but they are also flimsy and don&#x27;t hold up to changes in the grain or curves in the skin. I had so many knicks and cuts in my face I looked like a 12 year old just learning how to shave. Also, they irritated my face like no other. It was worse than dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends who swear by these razors, but unless you have tough, leathery skin, and a fine, straight, normal beard I would stay far away from these and grab some of the Personna or Wilkinson Sword Razors.</li>
            <li> These shark blades are fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using them for over two years in a parker razor and am continually amazed. One blade last at least a week on my tough beard. Great price and a great blade. Not skimping here.</li>
            <li> I switch to a safety double edge razor after giving up shaving due to all kinds troubles with razor burn and ingrown hairs. I was given a 5 pack of shark super chrome and a Merkur 180 aka 23c by a friend. Best gift ever!!!! I have tried just about every blade there is and this is my number one blade!. They are shape but not like shave with a wild cat on a stick. Try the other blades before you order a 100 count for any type of blades.. Me I have over 4 packs of 100 count under the bathroom sink stored a away. It is not like they are getting to get any cheaper then what amazon if sell them for! I f you like them buy them two packs at a time with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Awesome blades. I love the fact that you save money when getting this rather than the blades that I use to get.</li>
            <li> I seems to be more prone to nicks with this razor compared to others i&#x27;ve tried. Looks like I have a lots of nicks ahead of me as I purchased a 100 of these.</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp and using them with my butterfly safety razor is perfect for sculting my beard.  Each blade lasts about a week or two before I have to discard it, which is a great value, considering you get 100 blades per pack.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves this way &amp; had been buying his razors at the drug store.  We were delighted to get these at this price!  Awesome product &amp; an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I bought these with out doing my homework and by far these are the nicest blades yet! There made in egypt which was my only draw back. I prefer American made products. But They shaved better than german blades. I bought several boxes to last me years and years of shaving adventure. I used to shave with a mock 3 and saftfy razors put them to shame! I get the same great shave using one blade vs three. I&#x27;m never going back to those 3+, 4+, 5+ blades ever again. Oh yeah, if your a beginner I suggest a long handle safty razor and quality time with your self in the bathroom. Those blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> They are good blades. I have facial hair like steel wool, most DE blades can get about half of my face done before they start nicking my skin. These last about a week, and are so affordable that I don&#x27;t mind throwing them out that often. They arrived in 20-5 blade packs, so it was easy to throw some in my dopp kit and some at my girlfriend&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> Ordered a mixed bag of razors to test out the kinds I liked. Both myself and the wife liked the Shark Super Chromes, so I decided to order a year&#x27;s supply. Love them, will be shaving with these well into next year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but after using these blades, I felt compelled to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own an Edwin Jagger DE 89.  I have very sensitive skin, and I use Proraso sensitive shave soap, an alum block, and Gillette sensitive after shave balm.  With these blades, however, I am able to get a solid 2 pass shave that is quite close with no nicks or irritation. I received these blades in a sampler pack, and so far they are my second favorite blade in the pack (my first choice being the Big Ben Super Chrome blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have only had one shave with these blades, so I cannot attest to their durability or consistency, but I had a four day&#x27;s growth on my face prior to the shave, and the blade cut through my whiskers just fine with no tugging or dragging.  I have a pretty thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though double-edged razors are highly hit-or-miss, I would recommend giving these a try.  I am glad I did and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for the safety razor.  There are plenty of blades, nicely packaged.  Well worth the price, it will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> The work pretty good but you can only get about 2 good shaves with them</li>
            <li> I ordered a 100 pack of these shark blades because i was running low on Blue Birds and wanted to sample something. I have used that for the past year and they&#x27;re good. I&#x27;ve used these sharks for a couple months now and they are awful blades. I never get a close enough shave and they pull and tug really bad because they&#x27;re so dull. And by friday my face is pretty irritated from using them 5 days in a row.    I only get about 2 shaves out of blade. If you like having a permanant 5 oclock shadow day in and day out even if you shave every morning this is the blade for you.    It&#x27;s almost impossible to shave with a weekends growth.    The wilkinson sword blades at wallmart are way better than these.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying 12.00 for 5 gillette mach 3 blades at my local drugstore that would dull pretty quickly. I found my fathers old safety razor a few weeks ago and thought I would give these blades a try. I can honestly say I have not had a closer shave with any of the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; brand name razors. I am on my 5th day using the same blade and it is still quite sharp. That being said with the 100 pack i should be good for quite a while. In my opinion these are well worth the price. i will never go back to the brand name ripoff blades.</li>
            <li> I started my DE shaving experience with Merkur blades, but wanted something a bit closer.  I grow just enough stubble to annoy my girlfriend, but not enough for most blades to get on a daily basis without shaving against the grain and risking serious skin irritation.  My coworker got a trial pack, and gave me a feather, a sword, and a shark to try.  Of the 3 blades, the shark offered the smoothest and closest shave, without being so worried I could hack my face off.  The feather has an unforgiving feel to it, and the shark allows me to be able to repeat pass problem areas without worrying about cuts.  Obviously each face type is different, but for me, this is THE blade.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are great razors for the money.  We have been using them for over a year now.  I have always had trouble with disposable and electric razors.  They give me rashes, etc., and believe me I have studied every shaving trick in the book.  For 25 years, no luck.  These razors, in conjunction with a good safety razor and some Colonel Conk&#x27;s Shaving Cream and a Mr. Tweezerman&#x27;s badger-hair shave brush, I am in shaving heaven.  No more rashes or breaking out.  My wife uses these in place of some very expensive disposable razors she used to like, and likes these much better.  Four thumbs up!  Stu</li>
            <li> My husband like his razer and shaving cream, It cut very close just what he wanted!! He was proud of all  his blades, a very good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] for over 3 years now, and have been shaving in general for over 15 years. I have very sensitive skin, but tough as Iron beard hair. A bad combo for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been my experiences with the following razor blades. (Your experiences may vary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000850C1Y Merkur Double Edge Razor Blades, Box of 10]]&lt;br /&gt;I, like many other people used the razor blade that came with the product. At first I was amazed how much better my shaves where with the Merkur Razor Blades, but after awhile I noticed I was not getting as close a shave as I would like with them. These blades nicked me quite often, and did not last longer then 3 shaves per blade. They also seem to vary wildly from blade to blade. Sometimes you&#x27;ll get an amazing blade, other times it will chew your face up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out next, as they are reported to be the sharpest blades out there. They are very sharp, and do give a close shave. However I noticed that I cut myself much more often with the Feather Razor Blades then with the Merkur Blades, and that I had very irritated skin after shaving against the grain. They where just to harsh on my sensitive skin. The blades last about the same time as the Merkur ones, about 3 shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some more research here on Amazon and The Badger &amp; Blade website, I found a lot of people where recommending these Shark Razor Blades. Many said they where the perfect balance of sharpness and quality, and they provided an amazing shave. But before I dove into buying blades in bulk, I took the advice on Badger &amp; Blade&#x27;s website and ordered a [[ASIN:B0038KA5RC Double Edge Safety Razor Blade Variety Pack - 100 Blades!]] as I really was not sure which blade would work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Variety pack and the first blades I tried out where these Shark Razor Blades, as I was really curious if they where as good as people said they where. Well, I shaved with these Shark Blades today and I can say without a shadow of a doubt, that these Shark Razor blades are the best blades I have ever used. My face has not been this smooth since I was a baby. The quality of shave with these blades is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the rave reviews on these blades where right on the money.  They are sharp, but not to sharp like the Feather Razor Blades. They are of much higher and more consistent quality then the Merkur Razor Blades. And they last longer then both.&lt;br /&gt;I will echo all the other rave reviews on these blades, and endorse them as well. Highly recommended!hey where as good as people said they where.

            <li> I purchased these about a year and a half ago, so I have been shaving with them for some time.  They are pretty sharp!  I have been able to shave with one blade from Monday to Sunday, changing the blade each Sunday after shaving.  They hold up pretty consistent during that time period.  Anything beyond that and I get pulling.  But, so long as I change them once a week I get a close shave for 7 days.  Definitely a cheaper option that going with the new fancy cartridge razors and blades at $18+ for only a pack of eight blades!</li>
            <li> There may be better razors out there but these are the best that I&#x27;ve had a chance to use so far.&lt;br /&gt;The Wilkinson Sword razors that sell at Walmart for the same price don&#x27;t even come close to these in sharpness and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sharks give me about 3-5 shaves per razor and cut fairly smooth up to that.  At about $.17 per razor that&#x27;s super cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades feathers, derbys, personas, merkur, and I&#x27;ve found good ones but for the price&lt;br /&gt;These cant be beat&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, last for several shaves and the price is right. Like I said, very sharp, so use with care. My beard is course and this is just the blade I needed.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a great shave. I&#x27;ve been very happy since making the switch to DE blades because they are so much less expensive than razor cartridges and I feel like they last longer. These will probably last me for another five years, but I&#x27;m not an everyday shaver, so that number will vary on how often you shave. Still, a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for about a month now.  I have ordered&lt;br /&gt;Concord safety razor together with my order.  Please see my review&lt;br /&gt;of that razor at amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades worked very well for me, I hope that you find this review&lt;br /&gt;helpful!  :)</li>
            <li> When it comes to razor blades you cant really recommend some to others because everyone has a different face and beard. However these blades work pretty good for my face and i love them. The blades are not that sharp but they are sharp enough to cut without pulling on the hairs and i can usually get about 4 shaves on a blade. I love these and i would recommend giving them a try maybe they will work for you maybe not but you shouldn&#x27;t stay with the doubt.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 100 count expected very consistent results. It may be my face or style that changed throughout the 100 blades but overall, I found the quality in some little packets to be better than others. The inconsistencies basically meant I was looking worse on some days after I shaved with this instead of compared to my previous disposable head razor. I thought making the switch would be great but I just dont have the time to deal with this so-so product. I&#x27;m going back to regular disposable shaver head shaving as  it is more consistent albeit more expensive/wasteful. I do my best in other areas to be economical/eco friendly so I believe I can skimp a little in this area.</li>
            <li> Works well. Some people are connoisseurs when it comes to the sorts of blades. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference from these blades to any others, but they work well and are a great value. Best and cheapest option for close shaves.</li>
            <li> They work great for my heavy beard.  They cut me a little on the first use and then actually work better after a few uses.  I&#x27;m getting almost one month out of each blade.  I have not tried many others - so some might be better, but these are low cost and work fine.</li>
            <li> Pulled the trigger and bought the 100 pack. Big mistake. I knew I should of bought a sample pack to test them out. But the price for the 100 pack couldn&#x27;t be beat. Oh wells. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are not terrible blades. They gave me a clean shave. But the Merkur blades I had been using previously worked better on me. The only complaint I have for the Shark blades is that they irritated my skin a bit. Maybe my skin will adapt to them. It&#x27;ll have to. I have 97 more to go...</li>
            <li> Favorite so far. Can&#x27;t wait to try more blades. New to DE community so not much experience in this area</li>
            <li> With DE blades and razors YMMV, but these are blades definitely not my favorite.  The true mettle of any blade is tested ATG, this is where these Sharks perform significantly below par.  WTG they are OK, XTG just average.  As far as durability, don&#x27;t expect more than 2-3 shaves, with the second and third uses feeling a bit rough.  I&#x27;ll probably only use these for quick WTG shaves, when time or laziness don&#x27;t allow for a proper shave.  For better blades consider the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Feather (exceptional, but expensive)&lt;br /&gt;2. Astra (as good as the Feathers, for less than half the price)&lt;br /&gt;3. Personna (fantastic blades, made in the US if that matters to you)&lt;br /&gt;4. Dorco (wonderful blades, won&#x27;t give the closest shave but very forgiving, also very economical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that pre-shave prep and good technique go a long way in making a particular blade / razor combo work.  Also, don&#x27;t fret if the first time you try a blade you don&#x27;t get the results you expect.  You need at least 5-10 trials before getting the best out of a blade.  Unfortunately after extensive testing, these Sharks just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> Could be a little sharper but all and all one of the best blades I have used.</li>
            <li> hubby loves the back to basics savings of these, shaving soap and safety razor</li>
            <li> I read some things online regarding DE safety razors and how they would reduce the tug and pull of the disposable razors I commonly used in the past.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and bought a Merkur Model 180 (long) safety razor - oh man the difference my face felt during and after the shave.  I&#x27;ve now been using exclusively DE safety razor blades exclusively for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the blades ran out, I went out and bought these Shark razors, some Astras, and some Feathers.  My ranking in terms of usage life and comfort is Feather &gt; Shark &gt; Astra.  In terms of value Shark &gt; Feather &gt; Astra, the Feathers were only slightly noticeably better, and definitely not worth more than twice as much quite frankly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommednation: Go out and buy these unless you really need the best of the best (really course, fast growing hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> If you want a nice close and clean shave, these are the shaver blades I recommend that you use on your face. My wife purchsed them for me and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the money . Got tired of constantly buying a new razor only to find a year later I can find blades for it. Then they would soak me for the new model and replacement blades cost a fortune also.So decided to try the old fashion style Double Edge Safety Razor bought one here on Amazon along with \\&quot;100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edged Blades. The blades are a great value and will last me for years. The old double edged razor takes some getting used to but I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this already great quality bundle of blades when there was a small sale, making it an even better value.  The blades themselves are sharp and great quality, they bundle means I don&#x27;t have to worry for a long time about getting replacement blades, especially at the pricing of cartridge replacements.  I have completely switched from cartridge to safety razors now with the exception of traveling since you are not allowed to take a straight edge blade on the plane.  I suppose it may be permissible in check in luggage, but I try to avoid that now with the fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear the Feather razors have the sharpest blade but with the drawback of needed to be extra careful when shaving so as not to nick yourself.  I haven&#x27;t tried a Feather yet, but I find these Sharks to be quite sharp enough for my liking and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these Shark double edge blades with my Gillette and Edwin Jagger razors.  I have a heavy stubble and can dull blades quickly.  These Shark blades can last me about five to six shaves before I have to replace them.  I find them sharper than the Feather blades, which are supposed to be the sharpest blade known to mankind.  For the value, they are unbeatable in my opinion. To extend the life of double edge razor blades, don&#x27;t wipe them.  Use a blow dryer to dry the blade while it is still in the razor.  Also flipping the blade to the other side after each shave will prolong the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> A good compromise between the ultra sharpness but short life of some blades, and the long life but questionable edge of others.</li>
            <li> For the price these cannot be beat. Initial sharpness is close to mercur&#x27;s factory blades, however these do dull more quickly. However considering the price, these kick the 7am blades to the curb! Really there is no contest between the two manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much, only one other brand to compare to, but these seem better than the ones (Derby Extra) that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> super sharp, cuts through my stubble like a boss! i would buy them again but one blade will still cut after one week. so it will be a while before i need to buy more.</li>
            <li> this pack will last me a year. so much better than the crazy prices for the mach..whatever number it is now.  i highly suggest getting into safety razors.</li>
            <li> Context:  I shaved with 7AM Platinum daily for one year.  I switched over to these for the past month.  I know the difference between the two.  The two products are in the same class, but these Super Chromes have significantly better reviews.  For the record my hair is coarse and my skin is not the smoothest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Difference:  Without getting too scientific, the difference in the Super Chrome&#x27;s lie in the blades ability to cut through very small bits of stubborn matter on the face.  Both do fine at getting at the large and coarse hair.  However, the 7AM Platinum&#x27;s will leave hair/matter on the face that was too stubborn/close for it to shave off.  The edge of the 7AM&#x27;s will glide over small stubborn matter more frequently rather than cutting through it. The Super Chromes man-handle through the close/stubborn matter.  Thus, the Chrome gives a superior or smoother shave.  That&#x27;s where all these positive reviews come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Downside:  Because these razors cut more stubborn matter or hair off the face, they tend to dull much quicker.  This makes since because the 7AM&#x27;s will bypass stubborn matter and thus stay sharper longer at what it does cut.  In all, the Super Chromes last for about 2 really good close shaves and take off almost everything.  The 7AM&#x27;s will last for 3-4 nice shaves considering that you will feel that the shave isn&#x27;t the smoothest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you have coarse hair and rough skin then, the Super Chromes will cost slightly more over time, but will provide a more consistently smooth shave.  If you are that person that needs the mere resemblance of a shave and will not be critiqued, then go for the 7AM&#x27;s or something comparable.  In my opinion, these blades deserve the ratings they have been given.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy blades without trying them. Blades can be pretty hit and miss. I did some research before buying these and took a leap because of the price. I have a sensitive face and these turned out to be among the gentler blades I&#x27;ve used. I only shave a few times a week and go for the rugged look in between (still looks professional if you wear a tie!). Now I have a supply of good blade at a very good price that will last years! I&#x27;ll definitely try to buy these again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Satisfactory for two of poossible shaves.</li>
            <li> These work great, I use them in a straight style razor.  They work for 3 shaves on one side and the price is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades.  The quality is consistent.  They are sharp and give a better shave with my 1920&#x27;s Gillette Safety razor than any of those modern 4/5 blade razors I used to use.  Be careful it is easier to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to using a safety razor rather than the disposables I have been buying shark brand blades.  They are cheap, come very sharp and I normally only go through 1 blade per week, so this hundred pack will do me fine for almost two years.  Suck it disposable razor companies!</li>
            <li> These are great, by price and availability. It is way better than paying the prices for the other type, but it takes time learning how to use this type of blade so you don&#x27;t accidently cut your throat.</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny. I will never buy another plastic disposable razor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using straight razor for two years now, I love feather razors but gave these a whirl as the price is so cheap. They arrived quickly and well..... there&#x27;s 100 of them but the cut is very dull. I&#x27;d rank these  under astras and definitely under feathers. I have fair skin with medium weight facial hair.... after 1 shave they are a no go for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shark blades for nearly 2 years and am very happy with them.Started DE shaving about 2 years ago and a sample pack of various blades came with my Merkur 34c razor.At the end of the day,the Sharks seemed to give me the nicest shave.I admit that I have never tried the legendary Feather blades but those are so pricey that it negates one of the best arguments for DE shaving..namely the large cost saving.With this 100 pack,the blades are about 17 cents a piece!Hard to beat that.</li>
            <li> the blades are very thin. the edge does not hold quite as long as I would like it but they will work. I do like the way each blade is individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> Great blades that work well for me.  I get about a week (5 shaves) per blade.  Works great and cheap!</li>
            <li> Best price on razors, which give a closer shave than all the 3 and 4 blade versions on the market today.  Switch now and you will never be duped again!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves how it gives a nice close shave every morning, he gave up on disposable razors and his cordless/corded shaver. Bought him the shaving soap with bowl and soap brush, he&#x27;s much happy using these - he says it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all :-)</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying electric razors, and having them last only a year or so, and worse yet, they only give a super close shave for a month or so before it is at the point where it only \\&quot;basically just does the job\\&quot;.  Then replacement blades for electrics cost as much as a new razor, or close to it.  I figured for what I was paying for electric razors, I could be getting a \\&quot;razor sharp\\&quot; shave for the majority of the time if I went disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used disposable razors in the past, but didn&#x27;t feel good about all of the plastic that was going into the landfill.  But I still like the idea of getting a real close shave, every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always thought that the double-edge razor was something of a relic of the past, somewhere between the straight razor used in the old west and in barber shops, and the modern day electrics or Bic disposible types.  Then I saw a patient of mine shaving (I&#x27;m an RN in a hospital) who was actually a younger guy, and he swore by his double-edge razor.  So I gots to thinkin&#x27;.  I thought of going whole hog to a straight razor, but decided to make this baby step first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought a double-edge razor, and it came with ten of these Shark brand blades.  As an aside, it took me a while, even after owning one, to realize what people were talking about online when they said would say that they had switched to \\&quot;DE shaving\\&quot; (double-edge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when my shave gets uncomfortable, or not close enough, I just change out a blade that costs pennies, and it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor.  The Shark blades did a great job, and I mention all of this only so that you&#x27;ll realize that I really have not had anything to compare these blades to yet.  I&#x27;ve not tried other blade brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I went shopping online for blades, I found that for the price of the Shark blades, I think it was sixteen bucks, I got two years worth of shaves, assuming more or less 1 blade a week--some weeks maybe missing a shave ortwo, or taking good care of a blade I maybe getting more than a week out of it.  I learned online that most of the blade \\&quot;wear\\&quot; is actually corrosion from putting a blade away wet.  So I&#x27;ve started painstakingly taking the blade out after rinsing, and carefully trying to dry it.  Not sure yet if it&#x27;s working or not, but you can research/Google that yourself.  I can say that so far, I&#x27;m into the second week with this blade, and it still seems to shave quite well, with no discomfort.  I just never really paid much attention to how long my blade was lasting before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I give these 4/5 rather than 5?  Well, as I said, I don&#x27;t have much to compare these to, but I can certainly imagine that some of the higher rated blades, maybe Feather or even Derby, might be better blades in some way.  I just used the little pop-up on the star rating and it says four stars is \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; whereas five stars is \\&quot;I love it.\\&quot;  Simply put, I just don&#x27;t have that lovin&#x27; feeling for these blades.  No offense to the Shark blades intended, I certainly do like them.  They do a good job, and I think they are better than just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  Please don&#x27;t see the four stars as a bad rating in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these through Amazon, the packaged arrived quickly, packaged well and am quite happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them again?  I&#x27;m sure I would.  They do a great job.  But personally, I am thinking I&#x27;d like to try some other blades, maybe just because I can, and it makes things interesting.  But the Shark blades certainly are a good price.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry to get two years worth of shaves, and don&#x27;t want to do a bunch of testing and research, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Shark blades.  Great blades at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/1/2013: Am still using these, and stand by my original review (above).  I am looking forward to running out, only because I&#x27;d like to try another blade.  One thing that I&#x27;ve found, is that I do like [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL]], although I don&#x27;t think buying it on Amazon is the best way to go.  I got mine at our local WalMart for much cheaper, with no shipping.  Having said that, I do go back and forth between cheap Barbasol from the local grocery store for about a buck (I use [[ASIN:B000PIPVVA Barbasol Pacific Rush Shave Cream]] but here it&#x27;s a ridiculously priced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m still a very happy \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; DE razor user.  For the time being, I&#x27;ve abandoned the idea of going for a straight razor.  The extra baggage that goes with straight razors isn&#x27;t worth it to me.  I admire the purists that go that route, and in a way, it appeals to me, but there is a very real risk, no matter what anyone says, which is why my razor is called a \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;. I get the closest shave I could ever imagine with my DE, so can&#x27;t figure there is much to gain, except for the $8/year savings on blades that I could avoid.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, I have used multi-blade razors for years and got tired of the cost.  I typically shave my head also, so I was a bit reluctant to try a safety razor again.  But I found that if I take my time and use the shave soap, I get a better, closer shave.  Still have some issues with razor burn, but for the amount of money I save on razors, I can deal with a bit of that.</li>
            <li> This type of shaving device has a long and excellent record all over the world. It produces a smoother skin than the throw away version at a fraction of the cost. For those who are novice to the trade a suggestion: you should apply less pressure than usual or else you may cut you skin. 100 blades may last for years at 15-20 cents per item.</li>
            <li> Not sharp on tip or corners but sharp in the middle.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Inexpensive and sharp. I have a heavy beard and they last about 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
            <li> These work great for my face. I have used these particular blade for about five years now and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have never had a single blade be damaged out of the package.</li>
            <li> I am trying different blades.  I keep coming back to these and compare all others to these.  I need to try feather blades but believe these will be my choice.</li>
            <li> These blades are ok.  I found that they dulled too quickly though.  I&#x27;m using two blades per shave--not two edges, two blades.  Otherwise, they pull too hard on my beard and make it feel like I&#x27;m pulling them out by their roots.</li>
            <li> This purchase came fast and will save me the cost of the much more expensive razors you buy for $7, $10, or more at the store.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Save yourself a ton of money and stop using multi-blade razors.  Get yourself a good quality safety razor and buy a supply of these Shark Double Edge blades.  They shave as well as or better than the muti-blade razors and 100 Shark blades will last you for years.  They will pay for themselves and the high quality safety razor within the 1st year.</li>
            <li> Good price for good blade</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and will give you 3 shaves per blade.  When configured by performance vs price it was worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best of blades, but of a good value.</li>
            <li> I paired these blades with my Parker 99R - long handle double edge razor. New to the world of double edge razor shaving, I think these have been a good blade to start with. I have yet to cut myself or irritate the skin with these blades.</li>
            <li> so far these razors are working great! i just used my first one, and its smooth and sharp, doesnt cause irritation. good price. simple to use.. not much more i can say. two thumbs up and my recommendation to buy them! :)</li>
            <li> I bought these razor blades along with an awesome razor and I am so glad I will never have to go back to disposable razors again. The two combined are so worth the price. These razor blades are such a good deal! They&#x27;re sharp and provide a clean shave. Plus you get so many at once (I love how many come in a package- they last forever) and it&#x27;s so inexpensive. I will always be buying these razor blades!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed and at a great price too.  I&#x27;m getting into the Art of Shaveing and have been useing a brush and cake for a while now.</li>
            <li> These blades are great, and a great value.  I use them in my Merkur and like them much better than the Merkur blades. I am able to get between 5 and 7 double shaves per blade.  I am a recent convert to wet shaving and do not have any issues with razor burn (unlike the Merkur blades) and have yet to cut my throat with them. I highly reccomend you give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Over a year since I puschased this value pack.  I change the blades every time I feel I need to, and still have over half the value pack left!  GREAT VALUE!!  I bet I have saved $200 not buying those expensive 5-blade, turbo charged, slime injected major brand blades that need replaced weekly.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, switch.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations and adequately replaces a Gillette Double Edge Razor that is no longer available.  It is very well balanced and comfortable to hold.  The only problem I find is that the design of the handle when wet, because of its weight, becomes hard to grip while using it.  Your hand slides up the handle towards the head of the razor making it tougher to use.  The blades are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, I shave daily 5 days a week and swap these out once a week which I am certain is overkill but at the price why not. Two years worth of razors for ~17 bucks can&#x27;t be beat. Little to no irritation and a much closer shave for much much cheaper than gilletes cartridges.</li>
            <li> First shave and everything was as advertised and it worked well. Blade was sharp and fit nicely in razor. After one shave I can&#x27;t say anything on how long the sharpnest will last.</li>
            <li> Seems to be not as sharp as Chromium blades..</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about picking up 100 blades all at once, considering I had never used the Shark blades. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried because these blades are great. I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy a blade for over a year!</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these again because I loved them so much last time. Blades still seem the same but I&#x27;m taking off a star because they crashed the packaging.the blades are in paper packaging rather than the hard plastic the old ones came in. I have kids at home and worry about them getting into the blades.the hard case served as a safe place to store the used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;i will be the first to say. listen to what many reviewers have said that you should not but a pack of blades this big unless you have tried a few as every blade is different for every guy.&lt;br /&gt;But for me this was the first blade i tried and was the best. It gives a VERY forgiving and SMOOTH shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried Shark, Derby ( sucked for me), Feather ( great but not worth it to me, slight step down IMO at a higher price tag.) ASTRA PLATIMUM( good), PolSilver ( got the biggest knick on this one, more my fault not the blades but still didn&#x27;t like it, and the Personna ones which weren&#x27;t too bad but weren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> These little guys work perfectly. I&#x27;ve used one razor for a whole week, and it has treated me very well. I won&#x27;t need another razor for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different razor blades and this is by far the best. Last longer and less nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> I actually use these for razoring and touching up my hair. They are super sharp and durable. I would recommend these to anyone looking for double edge blades.</li>
            <li> Shark give the best value for the price. It has consistent quality. Better razors do exist out there but they are twice as expensive and only marginally better.</li>
            <li> Used these years back and then switched over to Astra. Found myself missing the Sharks. They are far far sharper which leads to less razor burn but more chance of those nasty slices. If you take your time these are superior in my experience. Sticking with Shark.</li>
            <li> These razors were a great buy good quality and for a great price. They come packaged in boxes of 10 and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with the razor that I bought as a gift for my husband, he has used this brand before.  I&#x27;m sure they ae just fine.</li>
            <li> I recently switched back to wet shaving and I ordered these blades for my razor. They are amazing and give a closer shave than what I used to get with my Mach III and its multiple blades. I recommend these razors without hesitation.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed with the first shave I had with this blade. I did cut myself, however, I believe it was because of previous experiences with other blades. With the second shave with the shark blades I fixed my technique and  had not cuts or nicks. The second shave was just as good as the first, in terms of sharpness. I don&#x27;t have to shave often or have a lot hair to shave. But the hair I do have to shave is rather thick and after going against the grain with this blade after my first two passes, it was a delight to shave with. It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money of quality blade. Remember, a dull blade is more dangerous than a sharp one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the blade is sharper it will last more shaves, so the extra money you&#x27;re paying for these blades will more than ever out than if you bought cheaper less sharper ones.</li>
            <li> I love these things paired with my Merkur Model 38 HD Classic Long Safety Razor. I bought these 4 years ago and I&#x27;m still working on them. Pick these up with a safety razor and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li> These are my favorite DE blades. I have used them for years. Not too sharp but not dull.</li>
            <li> Good product and I like how they are packaged.  Five blades are held in an easy to open paper box.  My previous blades were Feather Hi-Stainless and they were packaged in a plastic box that was wrapped with infuriating clear plastic film that I could not open quickly.  These blades are sharp and long lasting.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them in different razors and they don&#x27;t work for me.  Too rough.  I&#x27;ll use them because I  don&#x27;t want to waste the money but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These babies are very sharp.  Be careful on the first two shaves with a new blade in a long Mercury handle.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur razor that I have tried to use these on as they are more inexpensive than Merkur&#x27;s blades. I can only get lucky to have one painless shave out of these blades. I can use a Merkur blade for almost ten to twenty shaves. I don&#x27;t know if Shark makes a razor that would hold these differently, or if they are just poor quality. I would recommend only trying one box. I bought a package of 200 and disappointed that I did.</li>
            <li> If you have skin that is sensitive to shaper blades, these would be great for you. I have pretty thick stubble and these hang up in it. I like shaper blades like feather.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and these blades hold up well for at least 3-5 shaves.  I use them in a Futur at the least aggressive setting and have no problem with cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for almost three years now and they are the best I&#x27;ve found.  The others, like Derby, are fine, but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great blades for less than some of the more highly touted brands.</li>
            <li> They start out a little too sharp, but they last quite a few shaves and cut away even fluffy stubble.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be very thin and lays close to my face, so I have to go over it several times, however with these blades I get no cutting of my skin, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just didn&#x27;t work, For me these work perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these things are like 10 cents each.i feel like an idiot for buying cartridges for $3-$4 each that lasted two weeks at best!with these things it costs like 50 cents a month at MOST! Buy these</li>
            <li> After purchasing this, I attempted to use a brand from the UK that my father has been using; what a shock! These were nowhere close to Shark&#x27;s Double Edge Safety Razors. Not only do these maintain their sharpness for a long time, they are smooth and leave your face feeling like a million bucks. I will indeed purchase again....luv &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why, 2nd order &amp; I might as well use the first batch of used blades.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the fact, this 2nd batch is Cut-i-tis! Very Bad. C-</li>
            <li> I prefer feather blades because of the consistency and the sharpness. I have had really good shaves with sharks in the past and they do usually \\&quot;get the job done\\&quot; but there have been times when I have absolutely torn my face up with these things which I have NEVER done with a Feather. I have gathered that it must be that sometimes the sharks are a somewhat inconsistent and a whole lot less sharp than the feather blades consistently.&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little extra and get the Feather blades if these don&#x27;t work for you, your face will thank you. And if the sharks do work for you hey, its a heckuva good value.</li>
            <li> My husband has decided to go old school.  He bought a Parker safety razor and has never looked back.  These blades are economical and give him a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands, so I can&#x27;t speak to how these perform compared to others. But I do get a close enough shave for my taste. I snap them in half and use with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> Not the best blades out there but good enough for the amount and cost. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this blade once as part of a sample pack. I tend to have heavy, thick hair. This blade is incredibly smooth and gives a great shave, except when you get to the chin and around the nose, then it feels clumsy, awkward, and a little risky for cuts. If you don&#x27;t need to shave around your chin and below your nose, ie have a goatee this a good bladed. If you want a close, easy, shave around your chin and below your nose, try something else. Also this blades needs a very light touch and best to go slow with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with the Astra Superior Platinum blades.</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first Safety Razor. I&#x27;ve used the same blade on 4 different occasions. The blade actually works better after a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving the cost to use ratio right now. 4 shaves on each blade - 2 shaves a week. I bought 100 count, so these are gonna last me 50 months :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take that Gillete Mack 100, quaduple blade, self lathering, clogged up with whiskers, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought the Sharks as part of a sampler and glad now that I did. After the first swipe, the shave was rough and left stubble behind.&lt;br /&gt;A really decent blade, like the Gillette Silver Blue for example, will take off close in the first swipe. These blades are rough on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a sampler pack before buying bulk.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a super smooth and close shave for mere pennies. No pulling or razor burn. These blades are so much better than my old Fusion cartridges. At this price you could replace the blade every day and still not spend as much as you would with cartridges. As sharp as the blades are though, no need to change them that frequently.</li>
            <li> its funny how old is new better way of shaving ill will never go back to disposable love these blades</li>
            <li> Bought a double edged razor to save money on expensive razor refills.  These blades give a good shave at a low price.</li>
            <li> I got these to go with my safety razor. Have purchased these before because they worked so well. This pack will last me 2 or so years then I will buy more again. I shave daily...</li>
            <li> Great razors, nice compact packaging which allows you to distribute the razors slowly as you need them. After spending hundreds of dollars on multiple cartridges for my old razor I will never go back again.</li>
            <li> A years worth of razors for 11 bucks!  Can&#x27;t beat that deal.  Decided to try out Double Edge Shaving on a whim and I like it.  These blades are great and are good for up to 5 shaves per week if you take care to clean and dry them.    Update 10/03/14:  So I&#x27;ve gone through about 80 of these blades and have discovered that the quality varies quite widely.  They are still a good blade and better than some other&#x27;s I have tried, but, some blades are noticeably sharper than others.  This equates into some blades giving up to 3 acceptable shaves with the first being really good.  Some blades, however, have a tough time on the first shave. For the price they are a good deal and I really don&#x27;t care if I only get one shave out of 30% of the blades and 2 shaves out of 50% of the blades and 3 shaves out of the rest.  I have moved on to Wilkinson Sword blades that are much better and giving me a good shave regularly 4-5 times per blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. My facial hair is medium so the blades leave a nice smooth feeling. However, as with every razor blade I have used, I do have a bit of stubble left over under my chin and on my neck requiring a careful once over. No bloody tissues or any issues with being too sharp. I like them and feel it&#x27;s worth the money. Thanks, Rob:)</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, light and cut like a diamond edge. Good for about five shaves each. So cheap! You get a over a year&#x27;s worth of shaving for such a low price! It&#x27;s like 10 cents/blade. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 or 7 different blades. When I first got my safety razor, I made the wise decision of buying a variety pack before buying anything in bulk. These were included in that pack along with Derby&#x27;s, BIC Chrome, Sharp, Astra and a few others. I can say that these blades worked the best without a doubt. The Sharp blades were second but I seemed to get a cut and rash free shave with these more often than not. I was still honing my shaving skills (still am) when trying out these blades but I&#x27;ve since re-tried a lot of the blades I didn&#x27;t like to being with and still don&#x27;t like. The top of that list being the Derby blades. I might as well pluck my face hairs if I&#x27;m going to use those. There are some other blades I&#x27;d like to try (Feathers being one of them) but really, the Sharks work well so I don&#x27;t really have an urge to explore further. I went ahead and bought this 100 pack of Sharks and by my calculations, that should last me close to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a white dude with fair complexion and sensitive skin. Prior to using a DE safety razor, I used the BIC single blade sensitive skin razors exclusively. They were the only thing that wouldn&#x27;t tear my face up. Just posting this for reference.</li>
            <li> I change blades every forth shave. I do not shave everyday since it&#x27;s not important to my field of work. Cuts through the heavy stuff easily. Comes in 20 packs of 5 blades each.</li>
            <li> I never buy or keep something that is not what I thought it was and I never give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different kinds of blades now (Persona USA blue, and Shark Super Stainless were the other two). Of the three, these are the sharpest, and the most uniform in quality. As others have posted, they do not stay sharp for long, but, even with thick whiskers, you can get one excellent shave from each side of a blade. At under 6 cents per shave, I figure that is luxury at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> Works well for what it is, 100 blades for $10, you can&#x27;t beat that.  I plan on purchasing more when this pack runs out.</li>
            <li> Blades were shipped on time and exactly as advertised. So far, they&#x27;ve all been sharp</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Quantity</li>
            <li> much better and cheaper than regular plastic rarzor shave!&lt;br /&gt;ill never go back to regular blade cartridges, this are much better.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite at this price. I read every where that it&#x27;s difficult to find a good blade for your skin and hair type, so I bought a sampler pack. These were the best for the price. The only problem I find is that it depends a lot on your razor also. I really like these blades in my weishi but they do not work well in my Edwin jagger</li>
            <li> Excellent.  For the price you cant beat it.  Better than the cartridges.</li>
            <li> I got these a number of years ago and still have not depleted my store. When you do the math for the cost, nothing can beat it.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that for me this blade provides an amazing close shave but that is my experience and may not be for others. This product is cheap but not in quality just in price, it is great quality and actually lasts at least 3 shaves while staying extremely sharp. In the past I have payed more for duller blades by wilkinson sword.&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is very course and usually dulls out blades like fusion and carts alike within the first shave depending on how thick the beard growth is and im not talking about it being thick at all. The first shave i had with this blade, my beard growth was quite thick about 3 weeks of growth and the blade cut right through and only needed 2 passes, oh and it stayed sharp enough for two more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these blades a five star rating because the rating system didnt go into the diamonds (usually seen in hotels that bill gates goes to) and these will be my goto blades for the next 60-80 years i will shave  and i would rate them into the diamond rating system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes - everything, the blades sit nicely into the razor and is sharp through many shaves. the blades are very good quality and rather inexpensive, these blades all 100 of them will last me atleast 2 years for 16$ plus shipping which wasnt much. Does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dis Likes  - None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations - to anyone who wants a close shave that has hair like mine which is very course, although i am sure that anyone could with any type of hair would find them comfortable. I also have sensitive skin and they do not irritate my face. I also recommend them to my friends and family as i am trying to show them the way away from the carts and the crap that you buy in canada that isn&#x27;t safety razors or straight razors which is the best way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - honestly I am going to buy more when i need it, i may buy a few 100 packs so i dont have to order for a long while. they are the best that i have used and they are great for my wallet. If you want a great shave that is in my opinion better then a derby and cheaper then one too, then get these, try them out i am very sure that you will like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades. I use them with my Jack Black safety razor made by Muhle. Having relied on others&#x27; reviews and safety razor shaving forums, I purchased these as my first refills. There was a noticeable difference in shaving smoothness compared to the one razor blade that was included with my safety razor when I first bought it. Knock on wood, no shaving nicks yet.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not too sharp. Safe shave.</li>
            <li> So far these are one of the worst blades I have used. Shave my head daily and I use Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades but I got these with an order I placed on Amazon and used the first and last one of these blades I will ever use. For the first time my head looks like well shake bait I am bleeding from every spot on my head It looks like I shave with a steak knife!!!! Never again will I use these&amp;#62; All I can say is my alum block got a workout today. Never shave without a Alum block!!! especially if you are changing blade brands!!!!</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not so sharp that they irritate my face. No pulling hairs with these blades. 100 pack was a great value!</li>
            <li> I bought these with my new shaver and they work great together.  They are so much cheaper than other disposable blades and will probably last me for a couple years.</li>
            <li> A blade is good for 2-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> It is what it say it is, a freakin ton of razors i dont know why i bought so many.</li>
            <li> I got these blades in a sample pack. They are not the blades for me unfortunately. I had a good lather and I maintained an even angle. I had a 2 day low shadow beard. I started out with slow even strokes and I got a lot of pulling and tugging and my shave was rather uncomfortable. This is my personal experience. Some get a good shave with these. Some don&#x27;t. I highly recommend you sample blades before you buy a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely durable.</li>
            <li> These are quality blades at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been using single-blade safety razors for just over 2 years and have tried many different blades. The Shark blades provide a great shave without drag...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I&#x27;m very happy with these blades (my only other experience is with Wilkinson brand). They come in convenient 5-blade packs, so you can just bring a few along on a trip, etc (also, it&#x27;s better than a box of 100 loose blades). I&#x27;ve been getting a good, close shave with these. I&#x27;ve got enough to last me quite awhile, so I&#x27;m glad that they give a comfortable shave. I would definitely recommend these (though my experience with other brands is limited).</li>
            <li> I ordered these blades with my razor purchase at the same time and I&#x27;m happy I did. The shipping was fast and these blades have a good edge on them. my only concern is that the used blades don&#x27;t fit back under the holders like on other DE blades I&#x27;ve gotten before, not a big problem if you have a razor safe for them, but its something I wanted to pass on. Other than that these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> This last year I discovered traditional wet shaving (for many of the same reasons that I&#x27;ve seen others articulate--cost, comfort, etc.), and bought a sampler pack that I found here on Amazon. It seemed like a good deal and gave me the opportunity to try several different blades. At the same time I was trying out several different razors (from a contemporary Merkur to several pre-WWII vintage Gillette razors), so each blade was used in a variety of razors. My beard is probably medium thickness (my Dad says it is thicker than his, but I&#x27;ve seen beards far thicker than mine).    It took me about six months to a year to work through that sampler pack, and I picked several finalists (including Derby, Lord and Feather blades). I found that this blade was the only one that gave me consistent, baby&#x27;s-butt-smooth, nick/burn-free shaves with a VARIETY of razors. It also lasted longer than any of the others. I typically get two weeks worth of shaves out of this razor when I was getting only one with all the others. For the relative price of this blade compared to the rest, this blade, in my opinion, was by far the best of the pack.    Of course, all shavers have different needs and experiences. I&#x27;d encourage anyone new to traditional wet shaving to buy a sampler pack first and try several different blades until they find one they feel comfortable with--but in light of the due diligence described above, I&#x27;ve decided that the Shark Super Chrome is definitely the blade for me.</li>
            <li> There are some important principles that customers must understand before seriously considering this review:    1) There&#x27;s a huge learning curve when learning how to switch to a double edge safety razor. Make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing with the razor before you blame all the nicks and cuts on the blade.    2) Everyone&#x27;s face is different. Period.     Having said that, I first started using my Parker 82r with these blades because they come with the razor. After figuring out how to use the razor, I bought an alum block and a blade sampler to see if there were better blades out there. PLEASE READ: I define my beard texture as a coarse beard with skin that&#x27;s mild to moderately sensitive. With this in mind, I will say that this is a great razor, but I have found better. I can get a close 2-3 shaves, but there&#x27;s a good amount of irritation after shaving. Can you get a good shave with this blade? Absolutely. Is it cheaper than other, sharper blades? Yes. Is it better than a cartridge razor? You better believe it. Do I prefer it? Absolutely not. I&#x27;ll use the rest of these blades to get my money&#x27;s worth and then probably never buy them again.    I have found that BIC and Feather blades work best for my face compared to Shark, Derby, Merkur, and Red Personna. With either BIC or Feather blades I can get 4-6 close, smooth shaves with much less irritation, all the while getting less nicks and cuts because sharper blades glide smoother across my face with less pressure (hence there is less nicks). Again, I could make this blade work, and it is better than a cartridge razor, but I would be compromising and putting up with some unnecessary cuts and redness.</li>
            <li> These were the cheapest blades I could find so I was pleasantly surprised by how sharp they are.  I will be buying more of these when I use them up.</li>
            <li> This is a great double edge razor blade. It is a lot more cost effective when you can buy 100 blades for less than 8 of the multi-blade razor blade. Closer shave than a multi-blade.</li>
            <li> you can not beat the price, even if you changed the blade for every shave, you get a close shave, they leave your face very smooth</li>
            <li> Great set for starters.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades that give me a clean and crisp shave with a single pass.  No burn or bumps.  I like the Derby blades,  but love these.</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the Derby&#x27;s, as the blades seem to be noticeably sharper. Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> Terrific blades and work very well. Very inexpensive and get a lot of shaves out of the blades. Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Blades surpassed expectations. Easy to keep clean and seem to last along time. Husband usually uses a straight razor but wanted to have a razor with blades to use when we travel. These are nice blades, quality edges that seem to hold up well.</li>
            <li> I bought these forever ago, and I still have some left. It&#x27;s a good buy. Just do it.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I will ever use! Shark provides a nice, clean shave. Great quality at a price that cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Works like their meant to.</li>
            <li> look- a shave now cost me maybe 2 or three cents-maybe there are other blades that are great and maybe even better-but i&#x27;m happy and a 100 blades will last me over a year for only $11.00- It makes me laugh that 3. 4, 5, track razors even sell- because you cannot get a closer or better shave with a good safety razor</li>
            <li> This does the job and they are so inexpensive that you can replace them as often as you like and not worry about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the personna red from Israel using and Edwin Jaeger DE safety Razor.  I thought I would try different blades, so I sent away for Feather (still waiting 3-weeks now) and then I bought some Shark blades.  I have used them on five different occasions, and no matter how much prep, and how careful I am, I end up with a face full of nicks and cuts, and I mean a lot.  So anyone want about 45 Shark Blades for free, lol.  Will never use again and never recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am new to double edge shaving  and purchased a sample assortment I only used one or these blades and I am throwing the rest away the razor iI tried them in was a feather popular and I had whipped up a good lather on a freshly washed  face  the blade tugged and pulled and didn&#x27;t leave me with a very smooth face I will have to shave with another blade but my face is so sore I going to have to put it off</li>
            <li> My husband just love the feel of this blade. He gets a close shave and does not have to shave daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of blades for almost four years now and will probably never switch.  I have tried other blades and have been very disappointed in the quality.  I start Monday with a nice fresh balde and can get a weeks worth of facial shaving out of it.  At the rate, this is the most economical mean to shave just short of a straight razor.  The shave is smooth and for me, has eleimiated any razor burn/bumps under my neck.  These are for manly men who can &#x27;rasle a bear with their bare hands so beware.  Respect it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As noted by many other reviewers, these blades will cut you because they are extremely thin and sharp (imagine that!)  They are definitely the sharpest blades I have used and to avoid cuts I put very little pressure on the razor and swipe nice and slow, going with the hair, along the grain.  Do not go against the grain of hair growth on the first pass or you will end up cutting yourself.  These blades are not for a quick and careless shave.  Take your time, use very little pressure and you should make it out without losing any blood.</li>
            <li> EXCELLANT RAZORS. SHAVE IS VERY SMOOTH. I BOUGHT 200 BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND THE QUALITY OF THE BADES IS OUTSTANDING. I HAVE GOTTEN 6 SHAVES OUT OF MY FIRST BLADE WITH NO PROBLEMS WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY  FOR MORE EXPENSIVE BLADES</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a Parker 99A butterfly razor and it came with a sample of these blades. I decided to buy the 100 count because I liked them so much. Very sharp, very nice. Buy these for your razor.</li>
            <li> Feels flimsy but shaves well.</li>
            <li> Cheap and cuts great!</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  They work very well for my face and in each of my razors.  I can&#x27;t think of a complaint.  For me the blades make it through 8-10 shaves before I notice a drop in performance.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for the price they charge is a great value.  I like the fact they are individually packaged which makes opening a box of razor blades a little safer.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product as well.</li>
            <li> note to newbies: DON&#x27;T press as hard as you do with &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; type razors or you&#x27;ll need a styptic pen :) If you have the right head on your razor(they are different btw) and get the angle right shaving with these is actually a pleasure. There is a learning curve so be patient and you will enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;I get 10 days out of a blade( I have a medium heavy beard and shave at least once a day) so shaving cost for blades is $0.01 a day. Pretty economical if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to open the razor and clean the blade after every use. That&#x27;s why I prefer the butterfly razors versus the ones you have to remove the head to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;On razors: I bought a Parker and the guide was wrong for my beard. Bought the one the bald guy from Pawn Stars advertises and even though it&#x27;s made in China(ugh) the guide is right for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The parker is chrome plated brass and the Chinese one is chrome plated cast zinc. Huge difference in weight and feel. I may see if the chinese head will screw on to the parker handle. Hmmmmm best of both worlds then.</li>
            <li> This one can be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I didn&#x27;t like this blade. I have strong facial hair (just like my opinions). People with thinner hair might find this a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong, of course you can always buy a SAMPLER first to see which blades you liked best. That would be my recommendation if you are unsure which double edge razors to get. Personally I have been trying the Feathered blades as they are sharper and seem to last an extra shave or two before requiring to be replaced.</li>
            <li> After slamming the poor packaging of the otherwise fine Shark blade, I have discovered how the packaging is designed to work.  One end of the plastic box actually has a hinge that allow the whole end of the box to pop open.  If you lift the lip of the package while sliding a blade open, the little door will pop open.  Easy then to dispense a blade, or to slide used blades into the box for disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy to see this when lookong at the box, but it is in fact suppposed to function easily.  I still fault the manufacturer because there are no instructions to determine this \\&quot;easy open\\&quot; feature, but it is there.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, I ran my own tests with razors in my price range.  These Shark Super Chromes at the time didn&#x27;t catch my attention but I found and ordered them.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought these! All the brands I&#x27;ve tried are OK if you use the proper shaving form.  But these Sharks stood at the top for me, the kind of guy with a thick beard who has a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow 10 minutes after shaving.  These get the job done like all the others I tried but there was one major difference that makes them my preferred blades.  That is, when the blade is new and for about 3 uses afterwards I can get excellent results with a single pass.  For me that&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with any razor of any type in my entire life.  For that alone I rate these a 5+.  The average life of the blades is pretty much the same as other blades and these are the hardest blades to get out of the dispenser.  I almost dropped them a star for that but couldn&#x27;t do it. I hope the next batch will be easier to dispense.  Nonetheless, these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and smooth, my best results so far</li>
            <li> Good shave with these blades, great price</li>
            <li> After trying several of the better razors out there I chose these Sharks. But it&#x27;s silly to rely on a review to make a decision on such a personal item. You just have to try several and find what works best for your particular beard/skin type. I have a course beard but sensitive skin. This Shark provides the closest shave without shredding my neck.</li>
            <li> These blades give a very close shave but are forgiving enough for beginner shaver.  Every person will have a different experience with different blades so I would recommend a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; for your first pack.  Figure out what you like.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and if you have a thick beard they really get a close shave after only 2 passes.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to shave with these so I don&#x27;t use them because I don&#x27;t want to bleed everytime !!</li>
            <li> Bought these a few months ago and have been using them ever since. Has more blades then I&#x27;ll probably ever need. They are durable, sharp and fit perfectly into my safety razor.</li>
            <li> The perfect choice to maintain your safety razor.</li>
            <li> The Shark blades feel like a higher quality metal than the Astras and I really like the used-blade receptacle that comes with each 5 pack. The shave, however, is nowhere near as good as Astra. The shaving experience feels like you&#x27;re dragging a dull metal strip across your skin. I will be switching back to Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> These are decent double edge razors but don&#x27;t expect more than a handful of shaves out of them if you have course/solid stubble. I&#x27;ll average 2-3 full face shaves on a razor which I believe is great considering the cost of these.</li>
            <li> Good blades, thin and sharp.. what else do you need?</li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth. Works well in all of my razors. Definitely on my short list of buy again blades. Rather long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m assuming that you have tried these blades and others and decided that this is the brand and style for your mug. If that&#x27;s not true then don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this mass amount as you&#x27;ll be a sad mac if your chin and these blades disagree.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried these blades and a few other brands and I like them plenty. I typically only shave once  week and get 3 shaves from each blade so at that rate I just bought blades for nearly 6 years. Not a lifetime but a heck of a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good del and a solid brand. I prefer the super chrome over stainless but that&#x27;s just me. I haven&#x27;t tried the platinum blades yet, maybe in 6 years I&#x27;ll tr them out.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as the Merkur or Feather blades (those are &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34; lined while the Sharks are &#x27;chrome&#x27;).  They are also less expensive and are less risky on the face (fewer cuts) and the shave is not as close (if you attempt a closer shave it will pull your skin and leave it red).  I am one year into the DS experience and I am going to give these a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7am, after the shave, my face looks fine (the shave is close enough) after the Sharks, but there is a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 5 o&#x27;clock.  With the Merkur and Feather&#x27;s the 5&#x27; oclock shadow shows up at midnight.  So 90% of the time I do not need to look like I am walking the red carpet.  So I keep Feather&#x27;s around but think I will be using these day-to-day.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, razors are sharp, split the order with some family members got a few of them to switch to safety razors, win win for everyone :)</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the razor blades can be cleaned and placed back in the razor.  I do not like multi-blade razors when they are clogged and do not wash out.  The shave per blade count is very economical too.</li>
            <li> These seem to do quite a good job. I do not know what sort of longevity others are experiencing but I seem to get from 4 to 6 shaves per blade. If this seems to be an inadequate number of shaves, I would like to hear from others and have them tell me what I am doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Unscientifically, I tried about 5 brands in a sampler pack before settling on Shark Super Chrome. They were by far the best, smoothest, and sharpest. And what a value!</li>
            <li> Great product for the money. Sharp blades and close shave every time.</li>
            <li> I have a Feather Safety Razor and use Prorasor Shaving soap or sometimes Old Tayolors Almond shaving soap and hot water.  Shark Chrome razors  are good but not as good as Feather or Astra. WIth any safety razor use a good quality shaving soap like Taylors or Prorasor and use hot water to rise face before lather and during shave to rinse blade.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work well for my facial hair, but might work well for others. My best suggestion is to find a sample pack of various types of razors. If these ones work best for you buy them.</li>
            <li> But these blades aren&#x27;t any good. They are very dull. When shaving with these blades it feels like you&#x27;re dragging a butter-knife across your face. They struggle to shave the daily stubble. If you miss a day and have extra long stubble to shave, well, best of luck hacking away at it. These blades have given me my first razor burn since I started shaving with a safety razor two years ago. After three shaves you definitely have to change the blade, good thing I have a hundred of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order some Feather, Merkur, or Blue Bird blades. Be kind to your skin, that&#x27;s the reason we started shaving this way right!?</li>
            <li> These blades have given me a great shave at an excellent price. I use them with a Merkur futur and Taylor shaving cream. No razor bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li> You may be able to find higher quality blades than Super Chromes, but these give you a great shave.  I&#x27;ve used some flimsy, low quality blades in the past.  Shark blades are thick and sharp enough to make them very comfortable to use.  I have thick hair, and they shave fairly well even when I let the stubble grow in a little thicker than I probably should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used Shark&#x27;s stainless blades before I consider these to be a bit of an upgrade.  I find the shave to be slightly smoother, and I usually get a few more shaves out of the chromes before they go dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice feature of the super chromes is the plastic case that they come in.  You can use a thumb to slide the next blade out.  After you&#x27;re done with each blade, there is another slot in the back where you can reinsert the used sharps.  Most blades come in cardboard.  I like the idea of giving used sharps a bit of extra protection before I throw them away to protect anyone who may come in contact with them on the way to the dump.</li>
            <li> These things are cheap and effective. If you&#x27;re looking for some affordable razors to last the whole year and then some, look no further.</li>
            <li> got to find the right match of blade and razor.  shark brand is ok but I think there are more suitable matches!</li>
            <li> I recently switched back to shaving with a safety razor due to the incomprehensible cost of cartridge blades.  I&#x27;d never heard of this brand of razor blades but figured I could take a chance since the package of 100 was less than $9.00.  So far I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased with the shave these provide.  I&#x27;m still playing with them so can&#x27;t really say how many shaves I can get from one blade yet but regardless, these are going to save me a lot of money over the cartridge blade alternative.</li>
            <li> My wife got me a new safety razor for Christmas since I was disgusted with using disposables of all types (how many Machs are there?!) and the ridiculous cost of cartridges.  These blades came with the razor and I had forgotten how easy and nice it is to shave with an ACTUAL razor.  They cut smoothly, last longer than I expected, and clean easily under running water.  I&#x27;ve seen other blade reviews that suggest trying out different types for your own razor and I&#x27;d suggest that too, but these work great for me.</li>
            <li> I rarely review products so that should tell you how much I hate these blades. I got several Shark blades as part of a sample pack. They nick and cut very easily. I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 years now and very rarely cut myself. With these blades, I have yet to complete a shave without nicking myself at least 3 times. The blades don&#x27;t seem to do well with the tiny bumps and rough spots on an average guy&#x27;s face. No matter how careful I am these blades just keep cutting my skin instead of my stubble. Even the extremely sharp Feather blades didn&#x27;t have the propensity to nick the way these do. I&#x27;m switching back to Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Working just fine in my Weber Bulldog DE. Minimum of 3 shaves per blade for me. Thats a years worth of shaving for $15. Hell with $25 for a 5 pack for a Mach 5 or whatever. Join the DE revolution</li>
            <li> Large amount but perfect!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp I got 5 shaves from the first blade and I have a heavy beard so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, after these run out I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> How great shark blades for shark week. These are great blades not super sharp but hold an edge for 10-12 shaves. Great blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor blades to use with a vintage razor plane which I use it to shape balsa wood models. The razors stay sharop and shave the wood like butter. If I had an old school shaver handle, I&#x27;d probably shave with these since they&#x27;re cheaper then the gillete refills for my mach 3.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband.  The last ones I bought him were Merker blades.  He said that they do not work quite as well.  But, he does like them and he has no irritation.  One blade lasted him about a month.  As I bought a pack of 100, he will be using these for long time.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the DE razor replacements.  I replace my blade once a week (every Sunday before church).  These blades consistantly keep a good edge for seven shave days.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face, razor, and technique is different, so a description of how closely these blades cut isn&#x27;t very useful. The cost of these, particularly in bulk, is very attractive, especially against the cartridge razors so widely sold today.  For those who care about their product&#x27;s origin: these are made in Egypt.</li>
            <li> What can you say about razor blades? In today&#x27;s economy the prudent buyer will be looking for the best buy while getting the highest quality for his money.    Over the years I have tried all the different shaving technical advances (?) in each case I have found that while the price has always increased the quality of the shave has never been anything but substandard.  This has always led me back to the basics of shaving with a double edge safety razor.  These blades I have found to be more than acceptable and give me excellent service of 5 to 7 days before having to replace them.  At a price of $17.50 for 100 I find that a yearly cost in blades, (assuming you are changing blades every five days), of $12.78 to be far superior to the replacement cost of the newer shaving gimmicks.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong, if you like these blades, and I do. I would suggest you try a smaller quantity before you buy the 100 pack, just to prove it to yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Shark Super Chrome and the Shark Super Stainless blades for about a month now. Frankly I cannot tell the difference; both give a super shave and seem to last the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chrome blades come in a plastic container of five blades while the Super Stainless come in a paper container of five blades. Maybe the difference in the slightly higher price of the Chrome is the container, because for the life of me I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the shave efficiency or comfort -- both five star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I buy again, I&#x27;ll go for the Super Stainless and save a few of dollars since the container which holds the blades is not all that important to me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of this bulk pack when compared to cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Price.&lt;br /&gt;Con: They only stay sharp for about a week for me. And I only shave 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> We have used lots of the samples that we got with the Merkur Model 180 and these were the best.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp for about 4 or 5 shaves.  Other blades I&#x27;ve used only lasted 2.  Therefore I find these to be quality blades.</li>
            <li> Wow, that was a great deal. I don;t see any difference in the blades I was using before. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I enjoy shark blades over feathers for there not so aggressive feeling yet sharp enough for up to 4 shaves and sometimes 5 or 6 if i do one pass shaves.</li>
            <li> For those that use this style of razor as opposed to the kind with 2-8 blades in them, these are excellent, cheap, and of good quality.  I am on my second box of these.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I began shaving at age 13, and started shaving every day a year later.  I can only imagine  how much I have spent on blades for my Gillette razors.  One day, my wife came home with a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide.  She figured with a name like that, it had to give a great shave.  The shave was OK, but When I went to buy new blades, I was shocked to see that each blade cost nearly $4!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That was the tipping point.  I bought myself a safety razor---you know, the kind your dad or grandpa used.  I found out the blades were CHEAP!  I bought 100 blades for about $15!!!  I can get 7-10 shaves from each blade.  I could probably get a few more shaves per blade, but at 15 cents a piece, why bother?  Even better, I get a closer shave with this blade than with the newest Gillette creation.  Two of my sons now use a safety razor and these super sharp blades from Shark.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I like them,&lt;br /&gt;I am new to the single blade, well I actually learned with a gillette way bac in the early 70&#x27;s then switched to an Atra for 30 plus years.  I got tired of the price so I went back to the DE blade.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Parker 99 heavy weight and it came with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;All the sites say to try different blades so I ordered a few that have not arrived yet but so far I am very happy with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this smooth a shave in many many ears.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit longer but I think time will improve as I get the technique down.</li>
            <li> Very well made sharp, like through case good when you travel. Like the price cost less than those expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with these blades, and they do a good job of it.  I just recently tried &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; brand blades, and a couple others, and quickly realized these blades are probably what you&#x27;d consider &amp;#34;middle-of-the-road.&amp;#34;  Other blades are sharper, but certainly others are not.  A good beginner blade.</li>
            <li> I have tried several double edge brands through the years but I don&#x27;t think you can find any better that Shark Blades!</li>
            <li> These blades can be used over and over again if you remove them from the razor and dry them off after use.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; sharp... but not so sharp that it removes your top layers of skin (like feathers). I get 3 or 4 really close shaves before changing blades. Get the 100 pack w/ free shipping for best value.</li>
            <li> I use the Sharks on two razors: a Parker 22R and  a Merkur 180.  The blades work fine and for a long time (almost two weeks each blade).</li>
            <li> Figured id give these a shot and for 15 dollars if i liked them i was set, if not, no big deal.  After about a week of use i switched back to Gillette 7 o&#x27;clocks because these just seemed to only give me one maybe two good shaves before i had to swap it out, as to where the Gillettes, i regularly get four to five good shaves.  I have sensitive skin and my facial hair isnt really that coarse so i thought id have no problems based on some reviews.  Even with a clean blade, proraso sensitive skin cream right out of a hot shower i would get tugging followed by irritation, ive never had that issue with Gillettes.  Not the best and im sure not the worst but for another 5 bucks i prefer the Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Good, sharp razors.  Can&#x27;t beat quality to price ratio when you consider that most cartridge razors are at least a few bucks each time.</li>
            <li> Been using these for about a year. Very happy. No rust, no problems. Nice smooth shave everytime. I change them out every week (3 shaves), just because they are so cheap. You may get more shaves, but really at this price I am not worried about it.</li>
            <li> Great blades, way cheaper to use a double edge safety blade razor than buying the junk at walmart. Better shave too</li>
            <li> Sharp blades close shave with these.</li>
            <li> not as keen as some others (feathers of course, and less so than astra SP or Personna blues), but smooth and consistent.  a two pass shave works best with these.</li>
            <li> very sharp and gives a good shave about the same as a straight razor. be careful this blade will cut you</li>
            <li> The blades work great, but the dispensers seem to have been mis-molded - you have to open the end to get the blades out. They&#x27;re supposed to just slide out through the slot. Still, they work fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself an overly harsh rater.  That said, I have absolutely no idea how anyone could provide a rating higher than a &#x60;3&#x27; for these blades.  They are quite dull and are not even remotely close to a Feather blade (or even a Merkur).  And yes, I am an experienced wet shaver, use pre-shave oil, Taylor of Old Bond cream, etc.  To me, a fresh Shark Super Chrome feels like a Feather on day three.  So, when you do the math, the Feathers are at least equal in price and provide better shaves (one shave at $0.17 for Shark or two Feather shaves at $0.34).  Back to Feather for me...</li>
            <li> I bought these almost a year ago, and I have only used about 20 of them. I thought they would only last one shave, but they do a couple (depending on how long you grow out your beard/stubble). I have been saving a ton of money ever since I switched to the double edge. And the blades don&#x27;t give me any razor burn, which was a problem before. Personally I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t do this. Even if you used one every two days you would only need to spend about 20 bucks a year on blades. I was using the fusion razor from gillette and they cost a fortune in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the blades go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They are sharp on both sides (hence the double edge)&lt;br /&gt;-Can be flipped over (not sure if you get much more out of it this way or not)&lt;br /&gt;-Come in packs of 5 so you can put the big box in storage and have a couple sitting out ready to go</li>
            <li> I have only tried Merkur blades and Shark blades.  These are sharp, smooth, and a TERRIFIC value.  I don&#x27;t feel guilty about changing my blade more often, even though I probably don&#x27;t even need to.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shark blades for 4 years now and I just got my 3rd order of 100 blades.  I have a fairly light growth so I can use one blade a week.  Generally I shave 6 times a week and get a good shave each time.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and cheap in bulk. Saftey razor is my prefered shaving tool from now till death!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, but not the best blades out there. Go with feather.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades...forgiving and cheap (can get them for under .10/blade if you buy it in volume).  I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 years and tried a few other brands but I always go back to the Sharks.  I&#x27;ve got enough to last me for the rest of my life for only $30.</li>
            <li> I like these razors but to each his/her own.  Before you buy a ton of any razors, buy just a few to see which one you like the best.</li>
            <li> These razor blades were purchased along with a razor.  My some loves the razor but the blades? not so much.  Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as in the old days of using double edged blades, I don&#x27;t get as many shaves as I did with Gillette. They dull up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Blades shave nice and clean. Get about 2-3 shaves from 1 blade.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack that had 10 different types of blades.  This was by far my favorite.  Didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the 100 count.  I shave every day (military) and these blades last for about a week each.  Good, close shave.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> While blades vary from user to user, these really have been the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I have tried a few different blades, and keep coming back to Sharks Super Chrome... I have ordered these blades a couple of times already, and plan on keeping a good stock on hand...</li>
            <li> Used in my Merkur and Gillette DE razors. One of the sharpest I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t leave rust marks in the razor. Each blade good for 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> These blades give a really close shave without irritation.  I have been using them for the past year, and out of 15 other brands these are the best I&#x27;ve used. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 20 years or so, and professionally for around 15 of them.  I have used all kinds of blades in my time and I have to say these blades were the very worst. I mean, chopped beef bad.  After the first shave, I thought, maybe I was just too used to my previous brand and I chalked it up to a rushed job.  So the next time I was extremely careful and took my sweet time shaving. I used the best shaving oils and after shave.  I was prepared for it this time.  Needless to say, the job ended up the same.  My face was on fire for days and the shave wasn&#x27;t even that close to begin with.  I now have 98 razors left that I will never use.  I hate these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used these blades so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. .. .. .. .. ..</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and it is a great deal. Buying the blades in 100 count really makes shaving so much more affordable. They seem sharp and do the job.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep this brief. I have tried five different brands of blades, and these have performed the best. These in my razor give me the closest shave without any nicks or cuts and just glides through my whiskers and this just using regular old shaving cream in a can.. For the cost I cant recommend any other blade delivering a better value.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat these blades. I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior. Amazing how the best technology is not always the newest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell a big difference between these and the super stainless, they both work great.</li>
            <li> Tested several packs, but every blade I used tore me up by the end of the shave. Your mileage may vary, but I find that Personna blades work better with my razors.</li>
            <li> Durable, with edges that last</li>
            <li> excellent item thank-you</li>
            <li> These blades are good for one shave.... maybe. I dont know if they&#x27;re dull or what, but they pull hair and require multiple passes to get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Best blades for me. Every other Blade I use cuts up my face or just doesnt cut at all. I highly recomend these ones!</li>
            <li> They seem to be shaving me OK.This the first time i ever used this type of razor blade.So for the most part i&#x27;m satisfied with this product.The positive thing I can say that is far more economical to be shaving with this type of blade versus the mach type systems</li>
            <li> I got the 100 count. Yep, I&#x27;m set for an entire year. This is a quality product, definitely will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of sampling different blades to find the one I like.  I have found these to be less sharp than others.  I feel like they are pulling the hair out rather than shaving it off.  They seem to cause a bit more irritation than others as well.</li>
            <li> Shark is sharp but maybe not the smoothest. You need Gillette Russian blades</li>
            <li> Seem like good quality.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a DE safety razor and this is my first set of blades so I have no comparison, but they work fine for me and seem to last a while.</li>
            <li> works very well very sharp I have heavy beard no problem to cut does not pull have got about 4 shaves per blades so far.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t take to the \\&quot;modern technology\\&quot; that new razor styles offer. So he jumped ship and started using these double edge style razors.  He&#x27;s always used Feather brand razors since he started 9 months ago.  He&#x27;s been satisfied with them, but the bulk discount of these razors had him sold.  Bad Move.  He said these Shark razors just aren&#x27;t as sharp.  So, that makes 99 razors down the tube and another purchase of Feather razors.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Feather blades I purchased. This package will last me a year. I get 3-4 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> The way to go. Nice blades, not as smooth as the Wilkinson Sword, but sharp as SH*T, you&#x27;ll get 4-5 shaves from each one.</li>
            <li> best razor blade on the market</li>
            <li> Sample before buying too many. Three different razors, two soaps, and two shaving creams later, these still cut OK but with a little tug...and ALWAYS end up leaving razor burn and moderate irritation.</li>
            <li> Now I Had Never Used Sharks Before As I Tend To Shun &#x27;Super Sharp&#x27; Blades.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I didn&#x27;t order them but they came free with a razor I just bought from Amazon so i thought Id record&lt;br /&gt; my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be fair I tested them both in my Merkur Adjustable and also in a Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think there a very good and sharp blade but people new to wet shaving &#x27;REALLY&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t use them OK as it does take a bit of practice.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They shaved me pretty good in both razors with only minor nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to agree with earlier reviewers that these blades being a bit thin that they are only good for 3 or maybe 4 shaves before they should be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are careful you can get a good shave with them but for the value maybe Astra or Lords are really a &#x27;better bargain&#x27; for the number of quality shaves that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly between the very sharpest blades &#x27;Sharks and Feathers&#x27; Id have to say that Sharks shaved my face the best tho Feathers came in a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkurs and Lords also did very well tho the Lords proved a bit difficult to seat properly in my new Parker R96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow out of the blades I buy from Amazon I have to state that Astras are my Overall favorites, Tho I can and do use Wilkerson blades from our local Wal Mart in a Pinch!.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know its a &#x27;Straight razor&#x27; trick but believe me it really helps to take a good hot towel and stream your face first before you shave.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I don&#x27;t care how careful you are and what type of blade you use it seems to me that one side of the blade will stick out just a bit more that the other side will so use the short side for general shaving and the long side of the blade for your last pass or your finish cut to get that really smooth shave we all dream about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the shave soap and tonic you use you willhave to decide what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last remarks are that Shark Blades are really good blades and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try them, But just use a little care and common sense with something like this as they are really sharp but just keep in mind that other blades may work just a mite better in the long run is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
            <li> Razor blades are a very personal thing. My results may not be the same as yours. I get a BBS shave every time. It&#x27;s a smooth long lasting blade. I won&#x27;t use a blade more than 4 times. I get similar results with all the egyptian blades that come from lord.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought a safety razor at the local pharmacy as a means to save some money. I bought these razors for the same reason. With little effort I learned to use the handle and these razors and get a shave as good as any I got from the triple blade name brand razor I was using at close to 10X the cost. The amazing part is that these blades actually last longer and give me as close and comfortable a shave as any I was getting with my former device. When you factor in I shave my head as well as my face you get the idea I am using the razor quite a bit. This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing</li>
            <li> Great price - great shave</li>
            <li> Really cool retro look. SO sharp that you&#x27;ll unknowingly slice your finger open when trying to wipe off some extra shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Stayed sharp for 3-4 used</li>
            <li> A good middle of the road blade, I find them tame and not to aggressive</li>
            <li> Smoothest shaving blade I have ever used.  You will not go wrong with these blades, for a super smooth shave I recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double-edged safety razor for over a year now and feel competent to rate these.  I began with a sampler pack, moved to these, then Feathers and back to the Sharks.  The Feathers ( Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades), as another reviewer stated, lasted for more shaves, but were too sharp, often nicking my head and increasing the chances of repeat nicking.  The Shark blades are still quite sharp, but don&#x27;t nick.  Obviously, this might have something to do with my technique, but after over a year, that&#x27;s not likely to change.  So Shark it is.</li>
            <li> If you pair these with a quality DE razor like the Merkur 38 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Great shave.  The amount of money you save on buying a years supply of Sharks vs a years supply of the \\&quot;hi tech\\&quot; pieces of crap advertised by the TV models will pay for your nice razor in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND you get a better shave!</li>
            <li> My go to blade before work, feel like it would be hard to cut myself but still get a really good shave. I do prefer feathers but I can shave in half the time with these. My staple blade for the working week.</li>
            <li> Wow! I had been using the Merkur blades that came with my safety razor but they ran out so of course looked to Amazon. I hadn&#x27;t tried a sample pack or anything like that but the price was low enough that I was willing to try them out regardless. They turned out to be better than the Merkur blades and I was quite happy! Keep in mind different faces prefer different blades so you might be better off trying a sampler pack but honestly at $12 it was worth the risk for me.</li>
            <li> 4 stars for the value! I get two GREAT shaves out of every blade. I have caveman facial hair. I can&#x27;t knock this product at all, its a HUGE value at 11 bucks for 100 blades. At 11 cents a blade who&#x27;s going to complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars you ask?  Because for the same price or maybe a dollar more per 100  you can get Astra which is a better blade. I get 3 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  I get over 10 shaves off each one.</li>
            <li> The blades are individually packaged in 10 count containers. They provide a decent shave and are cheap enough to throw away after every other shave so whats not to like??</li>
            <li> These are sharp and consistent.  I rarely get a nick. Gives a close, comfortable shave.  Very good value for very little money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat on price and quality.  The Sharks have been my favorite blade since I have started using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> love this blades. they don&#x27;t rust up on me ever. when ever i go to Caribbean or to the amazon rain forest i bring these blades in particular. there sharp with no drag and durable 3-4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice blades for the money!  Much cheaper than the expensive double and Triple razors they keep coming out with!</li>
            <li> I bought these as part of an Amazon suggested shaving kit for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present. Best thing I ever bought for him.</li>
            <li> Blades rust easily.&lt;br /&gt;Blades do not give a smooth shave on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are not packaged well for unwrapping during shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like these enough, that I am not keeping the remaining 60 blades that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had much better experience with Merkur Blades.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend for those safety razor users. Buy the chrome ones and not the stainless steel ones. The stainless steel are rougher and the chrome give a cleaner, closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have a lifetime supply of razors now :)</li>
            <li> Product exceeds expectations. Item was received sooner than I anticipated, surprising me with it&#x27;s delivery. I decided to switch to this style if razor after growing tired of spending excessive amounts of money on multibladed platforms that irritated my skin. I love this razor and my skin does as well</li>
            <li> Way better than the Shark stainless blades. And by far the best blades by Lord.</li>
            <li> My Parker razor came with a pack of five and they work great.  I can shave a full month on one blade.  I bought a 100 pack for 11.95 that would be 8.5 years worth of blades compared to a one month supply of the cartridge blades.  And it is a much better shave.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good.  I was using the sharp blades but these seem to be \\&quot;sharper\\&quot;.  Plus the amount of blades that come in the package and the fact that I use two blades a week, these blades would last close to a year.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I love these blades in my more aggressive DE razors and the price point is hard to beat.  These blades for me, won&#x27;t last more than two shaves and I can&#x27;t get a great shave out of them in my more mild razors like the Merkur HD.  However in a Fat Tip or Muhle these blades are perfect and I love using them on my head as well as they are forgiving.  Hard to beat nearly 2/3 of a year shaving for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Rusted after one use. Inconsistent degree of sharpness between blades. Pulls and razor burns. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I have been using Astra blades and decided to give some others a try. I have a course beard and need to shave everyday. These shark blades did not get the job done after 2 passes wtg and atg. They seem very harsh and unflexing. If I tried these first, I would have gone back to disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li> Such a better way to get a close clean shave, that will not break the bank. Just as good as all the new blades only cost you way less.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor bumps for a long time and some of the blades I tried felt too dull and all of the force required for me to get a decent shave left my face a bit raw and left me with some bumps. Other blades (Feather brand in particular) were a bit too sharp and I could feel them cutting a little too close and leaving me with bumps. These were the happy medium. Sharp enough for a good, clean shave but a little gentler than others. No bumps. These are the blades for me.</li>
            <li> Great price, great blades, great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the only blades I will use in my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands, and the only ones that came &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to the same results were Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently using in a Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> great price and the cut it great.</li>
            <li> These are good blades and bought a load of them. I tried Astra and like them better, but they are both excellent and affordable. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try these. Razors are very personal and what works for one person may not work for another. Try a few types and see what works.</li>
            <li> easy to cut yourself with</li>
            <li> Tons of razors for a great price</li>
            <li> They do the job, but you can&#x27;t compare to Feather Razor Blades, they are not as sharp but the price is not the same!.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad blades, but consistency seems to be an issue....gonna try the Israeli Personna&#x27;s next time, I hear good things!!!</li>
            <li> very good product. extremely sharp DE blades, that will give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;no irritation, no bumps, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended, who&#x27;s like to shave with classic DE safety razor!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the only other one I liked near as much were the Derby brand. With the Shark brand I find I get fewer nics and cuts and I can reuse the same one 3 to 4 times before having to change. At their price I could change every shave and not break the bank.</li>
            <li> As said, these are good single use blades for the price. They are not the sharpest, but are also fairly forgiving in terms of shaving technique and kept the razor burn under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, things took a bad turn about halfway through the 100 pack. Though I do not have a precision caliper to measure the blades, I am pretty sure I ran across a five pack that protruded too far from the razor and gave me some unpleasant cuts. I will not be using the rest of the pack.</li>
            <li> These blades are made very well and I would even say the best blades I&#x27;ve used. Before I bought some blades at CVS and they sucked because they either were too thick or weren&#x27;t sharp enough. But the Shark blades are thin and very sharp for a painless shave.</li>
            <li> These are in boxes that include five razors, so no need to have the whole box on the counter. The razors are also in protective envelopes, so there is no risk in accidentally cutting yourself while removing a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought these blades to switch from multi-blade cartridge razors, because of razor burn on my neck that I have had my entire shaving life (15 years). I have been using these blades for a little over a year, I no longer have any razor burn on my neck. These blades are simply amazing (only when compared to any of the cartridge razors, as I have only bought these double edge safety razor blades I cannot compare these to any other brands)! I am 100% happy with this purchase, switching to shaving soap and a safety razor was a great decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;The number of shaves for each blade is insane, I have used 8 blades in a year! After every shave (I shave every other day, and only my neck as I maintain a beard) I thoroughly dry the blade and the razor before storing. I will be using this $12 box of razor blades for a ridiculously long time.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in these razors.  I wish I did not buy so many.  I found that these do not last as long as other razors that I have used and I get more irritation from using these.  I understand that everybody is different but I wish I would have tried these before buying so many.</li>
            <li> The Shark Super Chrome work best for me, but make sure you try a sample of different blades before buying a larger pack. I tried 10-15 different blades before deciding on these, and I have been extremely satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li> Great Blades. I use it with my safety razor and it provides a nice clean shave. Replace blade every few shaves for best result.</li>
            <li> nice sharp blades. great price</li>
            <li> Very nice ! I get a very close shave with these blades. I had never user a safety razor before&lt;br /&gt;but with these blades I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great blades for the money. They work well for me, and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen varieties. They aren&#x27;t as good as the Shark Super Stainless in my opinion but those seem harder to find in bulk. Overall a good buy and you don&#x27;t feel wasteful using a new blade every shave.</li>
            <li> The only way to buy razors ....in bulk so you don&#x27;t have to keep fighting the crowds!! Very happy with my Shark razors!!</li>
            <li> They get dull really fast better off  buying blades from dollar store 10 times better</li>
            <li> Very good blades...no nicks...no abrasions..excellent price. Saving with a new blade every other shave is like living in the lap of luxury!!!</li>
            <li> First safety razor, and only blades I&#x27;ve used, so I have no basis for comparison, yet, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with these blades so far.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp but not well honed. Some are prone to cause nicks on the first shave, and actually improve after being honed on you face (to the detriment of your face). I prefer Derby blades to these.</li>
            <li> This little razor might not be what you expect at first. The initial impression is that this little thin piece of metal won&#x27;t cut anything. I put this in my razor already knowing the experience that I would have. Boy was I wrong. Four words: Hot Knife, Warm Butter. I couldn&#x27;t believe that this little blade could do so much. If you need a smooth, close shave, these are your blades. I am totally a fan!</li>
            <li> great razors nice and sharp&lt;br /&gt;they keep an edged thrugh a few shaves and better price even than the cheap ones which are getting harder to find at the local drug store</li>
            <li> Hubby seems happy. Bought these to go with a razor and he has not complained yet. Add for more words</li>
            <li> Really sharp yet forgiving, and the price is right. Made by the Lord Shaving company, who also makes several other brands I use. These are not my favorite from the company, but still a very solid blade.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my Parker 29L and I have no complaints.  I use them primarily to shave my legs, but I get a good smooth shave.  They are nice and sharp and seem to hold an edge longer than some other brands I have tried.  The bulk pack is nice as well.  I&#x27;m a fan of Shark&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are best so far. I shaved with Derby for about two years because I got a large pack without trying them first. After geting the Shark blades I now know that I don&#x27;t like Derby&#x27;s and to me the Shark blade is a smoother shave and much sharper blade. Shaving with these Sharks leaves my face smoother than Kate Upton&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> Bruce LOVES this product, so sorry he did not go back to this type of razor sooner.  The blades last a long time also</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay sharp for more than 3 shaves, but great deal for the price</li>
            <li> Great price for long lasting blades.  I got two boxes of these, one to go with my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day shaving set, and the other to go with my dad&#x27;s.  I figured each would last as long as a cartridge does for a normal razor.  Turns out, I was horribly wrong.  It&#x27;s been a year and a half and neither of them are close to the end of their box.  These little blades are wicked sharp and last a good while.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I got these blades in a sample pack [[ASIN:B004UIZFQW 35 FEATHER 7 O&#x27;clock SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD DERBY Blade Sampler]] and have had a chance to try all of them at least twice. My favorite 3, the ones in the running for a bulk (50-100) purchase are the Feathers, Gillette Silver Blue, and these. The Shark Super Chromes are the smoothest of three being completely free of razor burn or irritation. They are every bit as comfortable as the not very sharp or close shaving Derbys. No actually that isn&#x27;t exactly true, they are more comfortable and irritation free than the Derbys. To be fair the other two are right there with the Sharks but the Sharks edge them out by a noticeable and not insignificant margin. The biggest surprise though is that although they&#x27;re not quite as sharp (awfully close to it though) as the Feathers they deliver the closest shave. I&#x27;m going to use the rest of my Feathers and Gillettes along with the Sharks in rotation before making my final decision but right now it looks like the Sharks are going to be the winners. The most comfortable and closest shaving of the three top blades I tried and the least expensive too boot, yeah, I think I&#x27;ve found my blade. Did I mention how smooth and comfortable they are?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE After going through the rest of the Feathers, Silver Blues, and Sharks the Sharks won out and I ordered 100 of them. To be fair the competition ended up pretty much neck to neck but with the Feathers at $32/100 and giving me 2 good shaves (head and face), the Silver Blue&#x27;s at $23/100 with 2 good shaves, and the Sharks at $12/100 with 4 good shaves it became a no brainer. For 3 cents a shave these things are amazing.</li>
            <li> For a smooth and close shave, these are the best I found so far. Each blade last amount 2mo for me, no razor rash, great shave while showering.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat these for the money. They come in these little plastic holder that each holds 5 wrapped blades and on the back you can stick your used blades into it also. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the merkur blades my razor came with but still plenty sharp and last more than a shave.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase these if you are unsure as to whether or not you will like them.  Try a sampler pack (mixed brands) first, and then make your decision based on that.  Since I use one of these double edged razors per week, these are going to last me a long time.  It sure beats the crap out of paying for Mach III cartridges, though.</li>
            <li> Okay product for the price</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving so I can&#x27;t really say if another brand would cut less but I cut myself a lot when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it is better to spend the extra few dollars for the better blades but I am not sure which are better.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband because we have been having a difficult time finding his locally.  He loves them and said these will be the only ones he buys from now on.</li>
            <li> Good blades. Hydrate face properly and you will have no problems. I use Proraso cream after shower and pre-shave moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great for my beard!  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I use the blades 2 times before disposing of them. For some reason, I always get a better shave the second time around. That said, these are very good value overall.</li>
            <li> Second time buying these blades, first set of 100 lasted me a little over a year (i don&#x27;t shave on weekends). Already paid for themselves in savings. Always gives a great clean shave, be VERY careful when first using them they will slice you with little effort on a fresh blade. Will Buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shark Super Chrome blades for over a year now and have had great results with these blades. I personally will not use the blade for more than 2 shaves. Depending on how course your beard is you may be able to get 3 or 4 shaves per blade. Once you learn how to shave with a safety razor you&#x27;ll get the closest and smoothest shave you&#x27;ve ever had. I find it easiest to remove the blades from the plastic box by sliding the cardboard insert backwards to push open the rear of the box.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best blades I&#x27;ve used with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the plastic box the packs come in because there is a small slot at the back to store your used razor blades. I haven&#x27;t seen this for other razors. The blades themselves are very sharp and they perform great. In fact, I think they&#x27;re better than most other brands, even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great bargain too. One box of Shark blades has lasted me over a year so far. I will never use plastic razors again after switching to my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great! Better than today&#x27;s MORE expensive blades. Maybe everyone should slow down and realize that shaving can be enjoyable. My new blades cost just under $12.00 for 100. That&#x27;s almost two (2) years of shaving at one &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blade per week. Think about it; who are only one&#x27;s making money with the four or five blade edge?  I am more than pleased! Think about it!</li>
            <li> Great razor blades that stay sharp for at least 4 shaves for me. A very good bargain, and an absolute steal compared to your store bought blades</li>
            <li> Like any male with a beard of wrought iron who shaves on a regular basis, I&#x27;ve come to realize the amount of money I spend on razors approaches a dollar figure that resembles the auto industry bailout loan. To trim down on the cost, I decided to try a new approach, and invest in a different razor. These little babies were the result of a desire to cut down on cost, and it&#x27;s been a tremendously effective move. It&#x27;s also been a welcomed move; a smoother shave, and an end to the cash hemorrhaging from my wallet was so cheering, that I rubbed my face all over the celebratory steak I bought with the savings. If you&#x27;re wondering, there was nary a complaint from the steak after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are sharp, surprisingly long lasting, and provide a smooth, comfortable shave for considerably less than I had been spending. I have no complaints at all, and would strongly recommend them to anyone who has no previous experience with a safety razor. If your primary concern is fear of cutting yourself, let me assuage your sense of hesitation: I have no prior experience with a safety razor, and have never cut myself with this product. In fact, this changed my shaving experience from one of purely mechanical perfunctory actions, to one where I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy the shave. Give yourself a little luxury with the savings, and buy some pre-shave oil, a decent badger-hair brush, a worthwhile shaving cream/soap, and see how big a difference this makes for you.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade to pair with my parker razor.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 10 of these 100 packs. That&#x27;s how much I like these blades. More so than even Feather blades. I get eight shave from each Shark Super Chrome blade. 1000 blades will cover my shaving needs for at least two decades if not longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done buying those mach 3 blades that are 3 for 30 bucks... No point, these are better, last longer, and to me it&#x27;s even a cleaner way to shave. I&#x27;m never going back to those regular razors.</li>
            <li> After years of lightweight disposable razors, I decided to return to the tried and true double edge razor blades and I had to get re-accustomed to the heft of the Parker Faux Porcelain White Safety Razor. Super close, smooth shave. Glad I made the change!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 30 years and have bounced back between various disposable razors and have spent the money on various electrics.  Because my skin is somewhat sensitive, I have always found myself wanting for a shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and leave those tiny red bumps.  I have had somewhat better luck with disposables versus electrics and have tried all the latest and greatest disposables right up to the versions that are currently offered.  While the last disposable I was using the 5 blade Gillette Proglide with the vibrating handle seemed to work fairly well for me, I took notice of the fact that the replacement blades were very expensive.  I was listening to the Howard Stern show and came upon a advertisment for the Dollar Shave Club, which interested me enough to do some research and read some reviews.  The reviews were decent but I read that several of the reviewers said that using a double edged razor was more economical than using disposables.  I remember my dad using a double edge razor back in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s and decided to check out reviews on double edge razors and watch videos on youtube about how to use them.  My wife thought I was crazy as she heard me watching these videos, but in the end I decided to order a Merkur 38C razor along with a Van Der Hagen Shave Kit from Amazon.  The razor came with 5 Merkur blades and the shave kit came with a stand, brush, mug and some shave soap so I was ready to go.  I also picked up a styptic pen from my local drug store to handle any nicks.  I began shaving with all the products listed above and was a bit disappointed.  Even following the guidelines that I saw on the videos, of steaming my face with a hot wet towel for 5 minutes before shaving and just using the weight of the razor, I was getting nicks and irritation, especially on my neck.  About 2 weeks after I began this experiment, my wife bought me the Proraso pre-shave cream and the Proraso shave soap to try.  I was aware of these products but didn&#x27;t buy them because I felt at ten bucks each, they were not cost effective.  But after using them I found that you need to use such a tiny amount of the product for a single shave that it wasn&#x27;t really expensive at all.  They are menthol eucolyptus based and give your face a very cool refreshing feeling that last long after your shave.  Using these improved the whole shave experience, but I was still experiencing a few nicks each shave, even after changing the blade after 3 uses.  The other product my wife bought me was the 100 pack of the Shark Super Chrome blades which I did not initially use because I had the 5 Merkur blades that came with my shaver.  Once I was out of the sample Merkur blades I had,  I started using the Shark blades.  No nicks, and while I do a 3-pass shave (with the grain, against, and one sideways) the Shark blades pretty much got it done in 2 passes, even though I stuck with three.  I had no nicks or irritation whatsoever with the Shark  Super Chrome blades.  I shave 3 times a week and do notice a very slight degradation in performance on the third shave with the blades, but nothing major, simply meaning that the third pass is somewhat more necessary.  But at 15 cents a blade, I have no problem putting in a fresh blade after a weeks use.  I probably should have ordered a sampler pack of many different brand blades in the beginning, but I have been fortunate enough to find these and they give me a smooth comfortable shave, no nicks and no bumps.  I have found my blade, the Shark Super Chrome.  I think I have found the combination of the right shaver, blade, pre-shave and shave soap that will keep me a double edge shaver for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My husband had been looking for a high quality product and these really fill the bill.  I won&#x27;t have to shop for a while!</li>
            <li> Ample supply and high quality blades. Sharp and very nice. Great price as well. Perfect for people who prefer wet shaves.</li>
            <li> Blades aren&#x27;t as readily available as they used to be, but they seem to be making a comeback.  I think this blade gives the most comfortable and clean shave of any I have used in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Great razers. Extremely sharp be carrful. I&#x27;ll be buying them again. Next year when I run out. BTW you get like 10 great shaves with this razer</li>
            <li> What can I say.  Sharks are great.  Now I&#x27;ve got enough of them to last at least a year.  So I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> These blades are decent but are certainly not the best for me. They are great for learning since they aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as the Feather blades I now prefer. I gave the rest of the pack to my brother in-law and he seems to love them. So, to each his own!</li>
