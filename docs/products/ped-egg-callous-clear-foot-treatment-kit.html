            <li>Im MORE than happy with this product im amazed!</li>
            <li>I instead used what I guessed would be a good amount.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a good smell at all.</li>
            <li>Worked good.</li>
            <li>I will update if it worked good on his man feet.</li>
            <li>On the up side, the foot balm smells nice and will be good for hand lotion, but I doubt if it does anything for callouses</li>
            <li>I put it on and it came right off with great ease happy feet.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even let my beloved husband play footsie or wear sexy shoes anymore.</li>
            <li>So I got my handy metal callous scraper and worked away at it.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li>I will be more than happy to pay full price!  </li>
            <li>I used to have super cute, dainty feet.</li>
            <li>One thing tho, wish more refill peels were included and with that I gave this 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Okay so I had a miracle happen with the hole itself healing by it</li>
            <li>LOL thanks for helping me out</li>
            <li>you can always reuse the pad and add more gel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear my flip flops and sexy sandals again.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more kits-for mys inwelf, for my family, for my friends.</li>
            <li>The result was much better, but I still have a crack on each heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more than this thing</li>
            <li>They would have been better off just selling the scraper instead of making the cream seem like a miracle callus remover.</li>
            <li>i have THE most calloused feet in the world</li>
            <li>It took more of the product to get desired results than the directions required....</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better, but this does not work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have any callous</li>
            <li>Pedicures at the spa or salon cost more.</li>
            <li>End result was fantastic!</li>
            <li>but my winter feet were in need of some love.</li>
            <li>I wish that you got more than just 1 treatment per foot</li>
            <li>I saw too many times the advertisement that I got caught; however, the item is a ripoff.</li>
            <li>not all the callous was removed despite following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li>I do not blame the seller I blame the product you are better off doing the buffing with a pumice stone or better yet get a pedicure.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive my kit</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off soaking your feet in hot water and putting a good lotion on them.</li>
            <li>I think you would get just as good results soaking feet in hot water for an hour.</li>
            <li>Im glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full price!  </li>
            <li>My grandmother, my mom, my stepmom, my stedad and my real dad, my aunts and uncles, my friends,my husband (and he needs something good for his feet more than anybody</li>
            <li>wonderful Callous Clear really did help end my suffering!</li>
            <li>After one treatment my feet are 80 percent smooth, one more treatment</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, but it didn&#x27;t remove the callous as easy as the infomercial.</li>
            <li>I read and followed the instruction as written and they even showed it on the infomercial how easy it is.</li>
            <li>and I was able to scrape the rotting lizard skin right off my feet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use a file on them NO PROBLEM, and the balm is fine too</li>
            <li>I have huge callouses on my heels and this did not remove any of them.</li>
            <li>and my feet are still smooth after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give this a ZERO rating if available.</li>
            <li>sand your feet smooth</li>
            <li>While the foot cream is pretty good you can get foot cream much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>( I soak that in with socks on ) and I truthfully say thanks TeleBrands!</li>
            <li>I like As Seen on TV products and most of them have been good silly fun and most of them have been pretty good to boot!</li>
            <li>I purchased this and the first time I used my feet were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I think maybe if you soaked your feet first and then applied it, it might work better but</li>
            <li>My feet were falling off because they were rotting right out of my shoes!</li>
            <li>I would never have payed full price for an As Seen on TV product</li>
            <li>This is quicker and more effective than filing dry skin too.</li>
            <li>I realized my mistake ver quickly and flipped the tool over.</li>
            <li>, it feels good on my feet and somehow leaves it smooth for a little bit</li>
            <li>gel quickly penetrates the callous better than any other callous remover on the market, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>It would seem that it needed several applications to get it real smooth.</li>
            <li>I soaked feet in  a basin with warm water to remove any residue and filed a bit more in the rougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;4) rinse and dried feet.</li>
            <li>but this may not be useful.</li>
            <li>My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years.</li>
            <li>stuff isn&#x27;t even worth one star</li>
            <li>Idk wuts in callous clear, but it has no odor, doesnt burn at all, (in fact you dont even feel anything)I followed the directions to the tee, and will b buying this product again and again... :)</li>
            <li>Callous Clear is great and works well if you follow the simple instructions.  </li>
            <li>this product It&#x27;s not even worth the time that I am taking to write this review.</li>
            <li>I would buy again, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased a callus shaver by clear away on Amazon, which I ended up using to file my feet some more.</li>
            <li>I tried it right when it was delivered which came in today</li>
            <li>So it would seem P.T. Barnum had it right.</li>
            <li>I got the product in 2 days and opened it right away.</li>
            <li>First off, you have to make sure to put the pads directly on the callus which can be kind of a tricky task as the pads are a strange shape.</li>
            <li>I certainly wish I had the read the reviews before buying this product!</li>
            <li>It left my feet very smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much</li>
            <li>I treated my right foot first (focusing on my heel), following the directions, and the result was okay.  </li>
            <li>but the Manuka kept it clean after that, but my life was a constant attention to putting homemade cotton toe sock bandages, ointment on it all day long...over and over and washing the toe socks and making them and on and on, the hole hurt and it had a huge gnarly callous around the hole...</li>
            <li>Not?&amp;#34;  First let me clarify that we did not follow directions</li>
            <li>We used a regular metal foot file or as I refer to it &amp;#34;The cheese grater&amp;#34; &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>He has his feet worked on about every week and nothing ever seemed to help, hot bubbling foot baths, foot soaps, pumice stones, creams and so on...  </li>
            <li>I cried when I first bent it.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly-</li>
            <li>I have yet to ever purchase a product that works exactly how its demonstrated or advertixed.</li>
            <li>This product is a joke, my feet are better than the one in the commercial, and this product didn&#x27;t  do not nothing for them.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I followed instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I even used a callous buffer first and not a bit of change.  </li>
            <li>I applied it exactly as stated in the instructions and waited the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li>The first way was by the book.</li>
            <li>I started by soaking my foot until the callouses were softened a bit and more likely to absorg the product.</li>
            <li>When I first saw a friend of mine wearing them I complimented him on his shoes, not realiIng</li>
            <li>more work than on Tv but faster than a traditional pedicure</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work the way ot&#x27;s advertised, and I caution anyone who considers this product to look at higher end products.</li>
            <li>My first mistake was not seeing that this was one of those</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, was as directed.</li>
            <li>The first problem starts with the pads.</li>
            <li>It most definitely makes my feet softer and life easier.</li>
            <li>It softened the top layer enough to remove that skin easily and left my feet very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I saw the commercial for this product and was very excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I have now cut with scissors as much of the callous first.</li>
            <li>Then I searched the internet and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything  that says how long to leave the gel on.  </li>
            <li>The commercial looks very convincing but this product is definitely a rip off.</li>
            <li>but the Gel itself I put right on the toe AGAINST VERY CLEAR DIRECTIONS</li>
            <li>/&gt;2) used a large foot file and filed the calluses of my feet, it removed about 80% without much effort&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also think it cost to much.</li>
            <li>Did soften somewhat but did not remove callous very well.</li>
            <li>but I think it makes the rest of my feet much softer...</li>
            <li>The system is a beast that requires too much feeding.</li>
            <li>I did like the lotion that it comes with, very lite.</li>
            <li>Now you are supposed to scrape gently in a downward motion.</li>
            <li>And gently won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use so much force that you hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>I *was* able to remove some skin with the scraper... but not as much as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointed</li>
            <li>Might work for others as I am very sensative.</li>
            <li>but it seemed to do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much difference in my heels after using this product.</li>
            <li>HOW IT  REALLY TOOK THE CALLOUSES OFF OF MY HEELS.....</li>
            <li>I WILL ORDER AGAIN VERY SOON.</li>
            <li>Did not work very efficiently.</li>
            <li>once finished sanding then apply the foot balm and my feel feel so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I do not have much callous to remove</li>
            <li>I used this product but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>We are on a constant mission to find something that will make his feet better, so when I happened across Callous Clear on clearance, I thought &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>and right away after first application, the toe was softer and for the first time in years I could actually bend the darn thing!!</li>
            <li>I have to pay to ship it back to them, the shipping is going to cost as much as the product originally did.</li>
            <li>buy a pad large enough to cover bottom of feet and apply a generous amount of coconut butter put the pad on and put on socks while grabbing your toes to keep the pad in place leave it on your feet for a full hour and scrape your feet with a plastic scraper.</li>
            <li>The pads are barely enough for one foot and the ads showing skin peeling away are clearly special effects to help mugs like me part with my money</li>
            <li>but no where near as easy as the commercial so 1 star off because of that, you know they exaggerate to get you to buy the product.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and made my feet baby soft.</li>
            <li>Again I foundn that if tfeehe callous isn&#x27;t fully removed after the gel has set and the initial scraping is done, add more gel, reuse the pad, and leave on formd.ow another ten minutes.</li>
            <li>And it has left my feet softer and feeling super eqorriwj kmoisturuzed.</li>
            <li>Once again save your money, invest in a decent callous file instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I believe it&#x27;s supposed to be ten minutes, then I used the scraper and it scrapes more than just gel but the callouses off not like the commercial</li>
            <li>I did that at first before I realized the best way to scrape the tough dead skin off is to scrape in whatever direction you want.</li>
            <li>Thanks Callous Clear!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>when I was finished and put on the lotion, my foot looked a little bit better</li>
            <li>thanks callous clear</li>
            <li>This may work for someone who has normal feet</li>
            <li>but then again why would you want to purchase this product if you have normal feet.</li>
            <li>Then, simply file for a smooth, soft finish and apply the soothing Callous Clear heel</li>
            <li>I may have to do one more treatment to completely remove the dead skin from my cracked heel</li>
            <li>I found the instructions very clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have high expectations and this is far beyond what is required according to the instructions.</li>
            <li>DO: NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li>tried first day - left on 15 min - no results</li>
            <li>so I guess it isn&#x27;t a complete loss!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s close to a complete rip off!</li>
            <li>I took them off and my feet where so soft!</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li>The second time I soaked my feet until the callouses were soft first.</li>
            <li>I naturally have dry skin texture, but I don&#x27;t have cracked heels/ball of foot right now.</li>
            <li>might try leaving a little bit longer next time, I think that way I would just wash residue and not have to file a bit more.</li>
            <li>You could get a pedicure for that or buy a little bottle of callus remover in the regular drug store for $4 which works better.  </li>
            <li>There is a hard plastic lip at the top of the tool.</li>
            <li>Then BAM, I got Callous Clear</li>
            <li>Thank you Telebrands for giving us Callous Clear.</li>
            <li>Apply Callous Clear cream to the removal patch, place the on the calloused area and it softens and moisturizes your feet.</li>
            <li>As for my results, my feet didn&#x27;t come out baby soft b/c</li>
            <li>( I never got near the toe scab or sore itself  )</li>
            <li>The lotion your suppose to put on afterwards does make your skin soft</li>
            <li>Completely.</li>
            <li>you do complete a treatment, don&#x27;t forget to use the lotion that comes with it.</li>
            <li>For me, this product really workedEverybody is different.</li>
            <li>I applied the softener gel directly to my foot, waited 10 minutes and then scraped.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your cash.</li>
            <li>I applied the gel directly to my feet and waited 5 minutes (on thickest areas of the callous and cracked heels)&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t let everyone know that this product is complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>they just didn&#x27;t get soft and crape off  </li>
            <li>However, I managed to get them directly on the balls of my feet and heels (where I had unsightly calluses).</li>
            <li>MY FEET WERE SOFT EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li>I hoping it would increase the amount of time between professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>All it did was make my callouses soft</li>
            <li>However, after waiting for like forever with the thing on my foot, the gel never dried.</li>
            <li>SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND EFFORT</li>
            <li>So after reading the negative reviews decided to try my own method based a on how they do it at the spa with similar product.</li>
            <li>For those of you who dont want to try it, using strait hot vinegar, soaking in it, then using a ped egg or something similar works very well, but has a few def draw backs Vinegar is very choking, and smells up your house</li>
            <li>I use it on that toe and it has helped my big toe be normal again.</li>
            <li>They are not big enough for my heal and my feet are not that large.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have better luck removing your callouses with the dull edge of a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>it doesnt do much of anything except give the &amp;#34;illusion&amp;#34; of taking off dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was initially deterred by the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth my time to ask for the $12 back, but if anyone finds themselves near the founder&#x27;s home, you may want to do the world a favor and burn it down.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only thing that has been able to remotely remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>So when I put the gel on the pad and put on my foot, it didnt cover the entire outside of my heal and mainly went on the bottom of my foot.  </li>
            <li>I use the other pad and repeated the same steps for another area on my right foot.</li>
            <li>Callous Clear was something that finally worked for him.  </li>
            <li>Was ok but not great.  </li>
            <li>I had a deep hole in my right big toe for 2 and 1/2 years that came from a stubborn life long callous that gotten wet, turned white and soft and ripped open.</li>
            <li>I tried to put on enough so that it could penetrate and work barely 1/6th of what comes in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>But please don&#x27;t dismiss this product just because a few people claim it doesn&#x27;t work EXACTLY like a the demo video.</li>
            <li>I think this is a process that will have to be completed every other day Initially, and then go about your normal foot maintenance routine.</li>
            <li>I read both good and bad reviews.</li>

            <li> I will update if it worked good on his man feet.</li>
            <li> On the up side, the foot balm smells nice and will be good for hand lotion, but I doubt if it does anything for callouses</li>
            <li> I put it on and it came right off with great ease happy feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> AMAZING</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even let my beloved husband play footsie or wear sexy shoes anymore.</li>
            <li> So I got my handy metal callous scraper and worked away at it.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li> I will be more than happy to pay full price!  </li>
            <li> I used to have super cute, dainty feet.</li>
            <li> One thing tho, wish more refill peels were included and with that I gave this 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Okay so I had a miracle happen with the hole itself healing by it</li>
            <li> LOL thanks for helping me out</li>
            <li> you can always reuse the pad and add more gel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wear my flip flops and sexy sandals again.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more kits-for mys inwelf, for my family, for my friends.</li>
            <li> The result was much better, but I still have a crack on each heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more than this thing</li>
            <li> They would have been better off just selling the scraper instead of making the cream seem like a miracle callus remover.</li>
            <li> i have THE most calloused feet in the world</li>
            <li> It took more of the product to get desired results than the directions required....</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better, but this does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have any callous</li>
            <li> Pedicures at the spa or salon cost more.</li>
            <li> End result was fantastic!</li>
            <li> but my winter feet were in need of some love.</li>
            <li> I wish that you got more than just 1 treatment per foot</li>
            <li> I saw too many times the advertisement that I got caught; however, the item is a ripoff.</li>
            <li> not all the callous was removed despite following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> I do not blame the seller I blame the product you are better off doing the buffing with a pumice stone or better yet get a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my kit</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off soaking your feet in hot water and putting a good lotion on them.</li>
            <li> I think you would get just as good results soaking feet in hot water for an hour.</li>
            <li> Im glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full price!  </li>
            <li> My grandmother, my mom, my stepmom, my stedad and my real dad, my aunts and uncles, my friends,my husband (and he needs something good for his feet more than anybody</li>
            <li> wonderful Callous Clear really did help end my suffering!</li>
            <li> After one treatment my feet are 80 percent smooth, one more treatment</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but it didn&#x27;t remove the callous as easy as the infomercial.</li>
            <li> I read and followed the instruction as written and they even showed it on the infomercial how easy it is.</li>
            <li> and I was able to scrape the rotting lizard skin right off my feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a file on them NO PROBLEM, and the balm is fine too</li>
            <li> I have huge callouses on my heels and this did not remove any of them.</li>
            <li> and my feet are still smooth after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a ZERO rating if available.</li>
            <li> sand your feet smooth</li>
            <li> While the foot cream is pretty good you can get foot cream much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> ( I soak that in with socks on ) and I truthfully say thanks TeleBrands!</li>
            <li> I like As Seen on TV products and most of them have been good silly fun and most of them have been pretty good to boot!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the first time I used my feet were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I think maybe if you soaked your feet first and then applied it, it might work better but</li>
            <li> My feet were falling off because they were rotting right out of my shoes!</li>
            <li> I would never have payed full price for an As Seen on TV product</li>
            <li> This is quicker and more effective than filing dry skin too.</li>
            <li> I realized my mistake ver quickly and flipped the tool over.</li>
            <li> , it feels good on my feet and somehow leaves it smooth for a little bit</li>
            <li> gel quickly penetrates the callous better than any other callous remover on the market, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> It would seem that it needed several applications to get it real smooth.</li>
            <li> I soaked feet in  a basin with warm water to remove any residue and filed a bit more in the rougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;4) rinse and dried feet.</li>
            <li> but this may not be useful.</li>
            <li> My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years.</li>
            <li> stuff isn&#x27;t even worth one star</li>
            <li> Idk wuts in callous clear, but it has no odor, doesnt burn at all, (in fact you dont even feel anything)I followed the directions to the tee, and will b buying this product again and again... :)</li>
            <li> Callous Clear is great and works well if you follow the simple instructions.  </li>
            <li> this product It&#x27;s not even worth the time that I am taking to write this review.</li>
            <li> I would buy again, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased a callus shaver by clear away on Amazon, which I ended up using to file my feet some more.</li>
            <li> I tried it right when it was delivered which came in today</li>
            <li> So it would seem P.T. Barnum had it right.</li>
            <li> I got the product in 2 days and opened it right away.</li>
            <li> First off, you have to make sure to put the pads directly on the callus which can be kind of a tricky task as the pads are a strange shape.</li>
            <li> I certainly wish I had the read the reviews before buying this product!</li>
            <li> It left my feet very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much</li>
            <li> I treated my right foot first (focusing on my heel), following the directions, and the result was okay.  </li>
            <li> but the Manuka kept it clean after that, but my life was a constant attention to putting homemade cotton toe sock bandages, ointment on it all day long...over and over and washing the toe socks and making them and on and on, the hole hurt and it had a huge gnarly callous around the hole...</li>
            <li> Not?&amp;#34;  First let me clarify that we did not follow directions</li>
            <li> We used a regular metal foot file or as I refer to it &amp;#34;The cheese grater&amp;#34; &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> He has his feet worked on about every week and nothing ever seemed to help, hot bubbling foot baths, foot soaps, pumice stones, creams and so on...  </li>
            <li> I cried when I first bent it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly-</li>
            <li> I have yet to ever purchase a product that works exactly how its demonstrated or advertixed.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, my feet are better than the one in the commercial, and this product didn&#x27;t  do not nothing for them.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I followed instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> I even used a callous buffer first and not a bit of change.  </li>
            <li> I applied it exactly as stated in the instructions and waited the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li> The first way was by the book.</li>
            <li> I started by soaking my foot until the callouses were softened a bit and more likely to absorg the product.</li>
            <li> When I first saw a friend of mine wearing them I complimented him on his shoes, not realiIng</li>
            <li> more work than on Tv but faster than a traditional pedicure</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work the way ot&#x27;s advertised, and I caution anyone who considers this product to look at higher end products.</li>
            <li> My first mistake was not seeing that this was one of those</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, was as directed.</li>
            <li> The first problem starts with the pads.</li>
            <li> It most definitely makes my feet softer and life easier.</li>
            <li> It softened the top layer enough to remove that skin easily and left my feet very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for this product and was very excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I have now cut with scissors as much of the callous first.</li>
            <li> Then I searched the internet and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything  that says how long to leave the gel on.  </li>
            <li> The commercial looks very convincing but this product is definitely a rip off.</li>
            <li> but the Gel itself I put right on the toe AGAINST VERY CLEAR DIRECTIONS</li>
            <li> /&gt;2) used a large foot file and filed the calluses of my feet, it removed about 80% without much effort&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think it cost to much.</li>
            <li> Did soften somewhat but did not remove callous very well.</li>
            <li> but I think it makes the rest of my feet much softer...</li>
            <li> The system is a beast that requires too much feeding.</li>
            <li> I did like the lotion that it comes with, very lite.</li>
            <li> Now you are supposed to scrape gently in a downward motion.</li>
            <li> And gently won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use so much force that you hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> I *was* able to remove some skin with the scraper... but not as much as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointed</li>
            <li> Might work for others as I am very sensative.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much difference in my heels after using this product.</li>
            <li> HOW IT  REALLY TOOK THE CALLOUSES OFF OF MY HEELS.....</li>
            <li> I WILL ORDER AGAIN VERY SOON.</li>
            <li> Did not work very efficiently.</li>
            <li> once finished sanding then apply the foot balm and my feel feel so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do not have much callous to remove</li>
            <li> I used this product but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> We are on a constant mission to find something that will make his feet better, so when I happened across Callous Clear on clearance, I thought &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> and right away after first application, the toe was softer and for the first time in years I could actually bend the darn thing!!</li>
            <li> I have to pay to ship it back to them, the shipping is going to cost as much as the product originally did.</li>
            <li> buy a pad large enough to cover bottom of feet and apply a generous amount of coconut butter put the pad on and put on socks while grabbing your toes to keep the pad in place leave it on your feet for a full hour and scrape your feet with a plastic scraper.</li>
            <li> The pads are barely enough for one foot and the ads showing skin peeling away are clearly special effects to help mugs like me part with my money</li>
            <li> but no where near as easy as the commercial so 1 star off because of that, you know they exaggerate to get you to buy the product.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and made my feet baby soft.</li>
            <li> Again I foundn that if tfeehe callous isn&#x27;t fully removed after the gel has set and the initial scraping is done, add more gel, reuse the pad, and leave on formd.ow another ten minutes.</li>
            <li> And it has left my feet softer and feeling super eqorriwj kmoisturuzed.</li>
            <li> Once again save your money, invest in a decent callous file instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I believe it&#x27;s supposed to be ten minutes, then I used the scraper and it scrapes more than just gel but the callouses off not like the commercial</li>
            <li> I did that at first before I realized the best way to scrape the tough dead skin off is to scrape in whatever direction you want.</li>
            <li> Thanks Callous Clear!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> when I was finished and put on the lotion, my foot looked a little bit better</li>
            <li> thanks callous clear</li>
            <li> This may work for someone who has normal feet</li>
            <li> but then again why would you want to purchase this product if you have normal feet.</li>
            <li> Then, simply file for a smooth, soft finish and apply the soothing Callous Clear heel</li>
            <li> I may have to do one more treatment to completely remove the dead skin from my cracked heel</li>
            <li> I found the instructions very clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have high expectations and this is far beyond what is required according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> DO: NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> tried first day - left on 15 min - no results</li>
            <li> so I guess it isn&#x27;t a complete loss!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s close to a complete rip off!</li>
            <li> I took them off and my feet where so soft!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li> The second time I soaked my feet until the callouses were soft first.</li>
            <li> I naturally have dry skin texture, but I don&#x27;t have cracked heels/ball of foot right now.</li>
            <li> might try leaving a little bit longer next time, I think that way I would just wash residue and not have to file a bit more.</li>
            <li> You could get a pedicure for that or buy a little bottle of callus remover in the regular drug store for $4 which works better.  </li>
            <li> There is a hard plastic lip at the top of the tool.</li>
            <li> Then BAM, I got Callous Clear</li>
            <li> Thank you Telebrands for giving us Callous Clear.</li>
            <li> Apply Callous Clear cream to the removal patch, place the on the calloused area and it softens and moisturizes your feet.</li>
            <li> As for my results, my feet didn&#x27;t come out baby soft b/c</li>
            <li> ( I never got near the toe scab or sore itself  )</li>
            <li> The lotion your suppose to put on afterwards does make your skin soft</li>
            <li> Completely.</li>
            <li> you do complete a treatment, don&#x27;t forget to use the lotion that comes with it.</li>
            <li> For me, this product really workedEverybody is different.</li>
            <li> I applied the softener gel directly to my foot, waited 10 minutes and then scraped.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your cash.</li>
            <li> I applied the gel directly to my feet and waited 5 minutes (on thickest areas of the callous and cracked heels)&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t let everyone know that this product is complete garbage.  </li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t get soft and crape off  </li>
            <li> However, I managed to get them directly on the balls of my feet and heels (where I had unsightly calluses).</li>
            <li> MY FEET WERE SOFT EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> I hoping it would increase the amount of time between professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> All it did was make my callouses soft</li>
            <li> However, after waiting for like forever with the thing on my foot, the gel never dried.</li>
            <li> SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND EFFORT</li>
            <li> So after reading the negative reviews decided to try my own method based a on how they do it at the spa with similar product.</li>
            <li> For those of you who dont want to try it, using strait hot vinegar, soaking in it, then using a ped egg or something similar works very well, but has a few def draw backs Vinegar is very choking, and smells up your house</li>
            <li> I use it on that toe and it has helped my big toe be normal again.</li>
            <li> They are not big enough for my heal and my feet are not that large.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have better luck removing your callouses with the dull edge of a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li> it doesnt do much of anything except give the &amp;#34;illusion&amp;#34; of taking off dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was initially deterred by the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth my time to ask for the $12 back, but if anyone finds themselves near the founder&#x27;s home, you may want to do the world a favor and burn it down.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only thing that has been able to remotely remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> So when I put the gel on the pad and put on my foot, it didnt cover the entire outside of my heal and mainly went on the bottom of my foot.  </li>
            <li> I use the other pad and repeated the same steps for another area on my right foot.</li>
            <li> Callous Clear was something that finally worked for him.  </li>
            <li> Was ok but not great.  </li>
            <li> I had a deep hole in my right big toe for 2 and 1/2 years that came from a stubborn life long callous that gotten wet, turned white and soft and ripped open.</li>
            <li> I tried to put on enough so that it could penetrate and work barely 1/6th of what comes in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> But please don&#x27;t dismiss this product just because a few people claim it doesn&#x27;t work EXACTLY like a the demo video.</li>
            <li> I think this is a process that will have to be completed every other day Initially, and then go about your normal foot maintenance routine.</li>
            <li> I read both good and bad reviews.</li>
            <li> SEE OTHER LESS THAN STELLAR REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough pads and they&#x27;re too small to cover much of an area at one time.</li>
            <li> I only have minor callouses and despite trying this twice, it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I slowly removed the first pad.</li>
            <li> I do not have super hard or super thick hard skin to begin with</li>
            <li> And it actually works if you put a little work into it after you use the softer and pads that covered  my heals where the majority of my callous is from wearing sandals and at time bare feet around the house.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> My callous problem was minor compared to the ones shown on their ad</li>
            <li> After several tries and application, this product did not remove my callous at all.</li>
            <li> The instructions do NOT tell you how long to leave it on</li>
            <li> It makes the dead skin soft so that you can take it off with the scraper.</li>
            <li> It just seemed senseless to use that much unless you have an inch thick callous.</li>
            <li> I will try it again on the other foot and use a second overside bandage to hold it in place for maybe 20-25 minutes and see what happens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it but leave it on much longer than 10 minutes if your feet are bad.  </li>
            <li> It solved all my dry skin heel problems.</li>
            <li> Once you put the gel on the pad and then put that on your foot, the gel is supposed to dry up so that when you strip it, the callous comes along with it.</li>
            <li> Process does not work, and the user can&#x27;t even retry because the amount of product is too limited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of products from Amazon over the years, and have never written a single product review - until now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad callouses on my right foot for five years-and the past year, my left foot has decided to try and match my right one in having the dreaded callouses.</li>
            <li> It said to use about 1/4 of the softening gel on the pad, place the pad on the affected area, stick it down, and let it stay there for ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my dry cracked feet for months!  </li>
            <li> Plenty got on various areas of non-calloused skin and also had no effect (generally anything acidic would at least cause a tingle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet were dry and rough.</li>
            <li> This product is GARBAGE and did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and my callous isn&#x27;t that bad (just standard heel build up from wearing high heels).  </li>
            <li> It does not work, the only thing it does is make a mess.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed but how do you return something like this lol</li>
            <li> Callous Clear penetrates into the hard, calloused areas, softening and lifting so that, the calluses peel away.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised with the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would have done the job as well, if we left the gel on for &amp;#34;a few minutes&amp;#34; and used that foot scraper like the directions called out for, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as expected...</li>
            <li> spent $9.99 plus tax on this stuff</li>
            <li> This item is a waste, save your money and do a traditional foot soak and use a pumice stone or scraper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tool for your feet it might work if your heals are just rough not cracked.</li>
            <li> What a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do the job I expected  </li>
            <li> Not much product in the tubes.</li>
            <li> I usually go for pedicures every few weeks but with Callous Clear I save money by not having to go that often.  </li>
            <li> finally forming a thick scab and healing underneath it long story that I&#x27;ll spare you ) but the callous around it was still there</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This callous clear sucks, it make a mess and does not work.</li>
            <li> You will have to replace the pads, and every other aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> For me this product worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Pads are small but I reused mine (on different spots in one sitting)</li>
            <li> The other issue is the amount of gel to put on.  </li>
            <li> There was not enough product for even one completed application, the pads were too small to cover the feet and</li>
            <li> and the foot cream is okay but not worth it :(</li>
            <li> Wasted the money and only worked for a few days then needed to do it again.</li>
            <li> It does leave your foot somewhat softer but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used the filer side and buffed the area down.</li>
            <li> After searching other reviews, I did find a few people that tried 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this would work, but it was half price at my grocery store, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Keept  them on for about 10 minutes, slightly longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your.money go to the drugstore and spend half the money thumbs down..</li>
            <li> all everything they was saying about it not true, and please save your money.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to burn or mess up my foot</li>
            <li> , it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I think the commercials were a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> When I was done, I still had some tough skin left.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Please Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money...</li>
            <li> When I tok off the pads, I saw there was dead skin I could scrape off.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this product in hopes of saving a few bucks on a couple of pedicures.</li>
            <li> , I wasted my money with this product.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> few minutes\\&quot; is all the instructions say.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> hello i use this product  a few days ago and it doesn&#x27;t works, please don&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product and it didn&#x27;t remove anything it was just messy.</li>
            <li> Not worth it do not buy!!</li>
            <li> Very messy and the pads and scrapping device were not very effective.  </li>
            <li> I mean nothing at all but make a gooey mess scraper is a joke, pads are to small and the product doesn&#x27;t work  </li>
            <li> Not even a little bit, no good, don&#x27;t waste time or money</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The pads are too small.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me!</li>
            <li> Not much better.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought it and being somewhat skeptical, I left it on for 20 rather than the 10 minutes it directs you to.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a messy and disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I have very hard callused heels and have to go for pedicures every couple of months where they use a razor blade to scrape all of the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> but no the stuff did not remove any thing and the sliver i had to dig it out the hard way</li>
            <li> My callouses were just as hard as before and could not be removed without using a razor.</li>
            <li> You put the gel on your feet and what you scrape off is the gel not the hard skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> You would thing at least the lotion would do something to soften the feet</li>
            <li> My guess is that the people writing the negative reviews need to read and follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> I will stick to my Avon Foot Works products, at least those work.</li>
            <li> I hope this saves at least one person their time and money.</li>
            <li> I excited to get, but once received, it did not work, very disappointed, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly and the product still did NOT work for me and my callous isn&#x27;t even a bad one!</li>
            <li> , I mean that...</li>
            <li> I was afraid to leave it to long or get it on the softer areas</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work, seriously save your money.</li>
            <li> left it on for approx 30 minutes rather than 10 because my feet are so bad.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have even had to use nail scissors to cut some of the tough skin off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting tired of buying something that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, but it does work to a degree</li>
            <li> It seems to me that the person whose foot is used in the TV advertisement has very small feet!</li>
            <li> Did not have the dramatic results as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have the same ugly callouses I had before I used your product!  </li>
            <li> I felt let down and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nothing removed those callous&#x27;s and they can not only be ugly on your feet, but also painful.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I am shocked at all the negative reviews..</li>
            <li> This product does not work as seen on TV used it twice but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> i see the ad on tv, this product is useless, did not work at all, sorry,</li>
            <li> The high-gloss rubber and sleek silhouette has transfomed these overshoes from mere galoshes to fashion-statement footwear.</li>
            <li> I just doesn&#x27;t work at all, completely fake.</li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t realize it until I had already unwrapped it.</li>
            <li> Stupid product; poor instructions, very small pieces of non woven fabric supposedly to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the feet.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY poor product</li>
            <li> My feet were badly burned several years ago &amp; since then, my heels will split &amp; crack deeply Painful, as well as ugly</li>
            <li> So....my feet are in worse condition when I started and they weren&#x27;t bad to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Callous thick skin still in tact!!!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, I ended up very disappointed, please people don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not working for you, you must have gotten a bad batch or are doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was also desperate and I did not follow the directions either</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be afraid to work at it.</li>
            <li> Okay...let me start off by saying my fiance has REALLY bad callous&#x27;s on his heels.  </li>
            <li> And also smell bad.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE BAD.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Until I began developing these ugly blemishes.</li>
            <li> I felt frustrated and foolish.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my foot feel gooey. :(</li>
            <li> very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> I have also contacted Telebrands to envoke the 100% satisfaction garentee and even that is crap.</li>
            <li> Hate it, it doesn&#x27;t work @</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My feet were horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I followed hkelly&#x27;s suggestion, and it worked for me on some nasty heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>
            <li> It also stings horribly if you have any nicks &amp; cuts on your feet.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> did not remove any thing i just had a sliver under a callous thought i could remove it but no the stuff did not remove any thing and the sliver i had to dig it out the hard way thanks callous clear</li>
            <li> I found that the product didn&#x27;t work as advertised. It was a complete waste of money. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough pads and they&#x27;re too small to cover much of an area at one time. I had to use two pads on each heel alone. It seems to me that the person whose foot is used in the TV advertisement has very small feet! However, the product does work as advertised although I did have to leave it on a bit longer than the instructions state.</li>
            <li> People, stay away from this product.  It smply doesn&#x27;t do what is supposed to do. Just stay away from it.</li>
            <li> Okay...let me start off by saying my fiance has REALLY bad callous&#x27;s on his heels.  He wears work boots and is on his feet all day.  We are on a constant mission to find something that will make his feet better, so when I happened across Callous Clear on clearance, I thought &amp;#34;Why Not?&amp;#34;  First let me clarify that we did not follow directions and we did not use the plastic scraper.  We knew ahead of time it wouldn&#x27;t do the job it claims to do on TV.  We used a regular metal foot file or as I refer to it &amp;#34;The cheese grater&amp;#34; &#x3D;)  We put the gel on his heels and left it on there for 20 minutes and then used the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; and the callous was removed to almost nothing.  I was shocked.  He has his feet worked on about every week and nothing ever seemed to help, hot bubbling foot baths, foot soaps, pumice stones, creams and so on...  Nothing removed those callous&#x27;s and they can not only be ugly on your feet, but also painful.  Callous Clear was something that finally worked for him.  I don&#x27;t think it would have done the job as well, if we left the gel on for &amp;#34;a few minutes&amp;#34; and used that foot scraper like the directions called out for, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This callous clear sucks, it make a mess and does not work.I also think it cost to much.Dont waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Please Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money... I ordered it online and tried it.. the site sells it with separate shipping and handling, costing close to $26-$27.... IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK!. Please.... don&#x27;t buy it....</li>
            <li> A little disappointed. Did not have the dramatic results as advertised. Did soften somewhat but did not remove callous very well.</li>
            <li> Was ok but not great.  Very messy and the pads and scrapping device were not very effective.  I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I want to 1st inform I received my order in the allot timeframe. Now as for the product, it works. I read both good and bad reviews. After using the product myself, I will let you know how my experience went, and I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat  it. As for my results, my feet didn&#x27;t come out baby soft b/c I naturally have dry skin texture, but I don&#x27;t have cracked heels/ball of foot right now. I did add an extra step with peel on by wrapping my feet with plastic wrap for about 15-20mins. I saw this procedure on youtube done by a dermatologist. One thing tho, wish more refill peels were included and with that I gave this 4 stars. Hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Stupid product; poor instructions, very small pieces of non woven fabric supposedly to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the feet. Process does not work, and the user can&#x27;t even retry because the amount of product is too limited.</li>
            <li> but the commercial lied...it doesnt do much of anything except give the &amp;#34;illusion&amp;#34; of taking off dry skin. when your feet are saturated for 10 minutes it does the same thing as water does.. and the foot cream is okay but not worth it :(</li>
            <li> I saw the TV Advertisement of this product......I tried.......It did not work at all as promissed. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I cannot speak for anyone else and I was dubious because nothing else had helped me. I was also desperate and I did not follow the directions either but I was grasping at straws. I had a deep hole in my right big toe for 2 and 1/2 years that came from a stubborn life long callous that gotten wet, turned white and soft and ripped open. I battled with that toe hole for all that time...Manuka Honey kept it from getting re-infected, ( it had been infected once and  only antibiotics helped that ) but the Manuka kept it clean after that, but my life was a constant attention to putting homemade cotton toe sock bandages, ointment on it all day long...over and over and washing the toe socks and making them and on and on, the hole hurt and it had a huge gnarly callous around the hole...a living heck I tell you.  Okay so I had a miracle happen with the hole itself healing by it finally forming a thick scab and healing underneath it long story that I&#x27;ll spare you ) but the callous around it was still there and nothing I had tried had helped at all.  Like another reviewer, I too, threw the pads away and never touched the scrapers either but the Gel itself I put right on the toe AGAINST VERY CLEAR DIRECTIONS ( I never got near the toe scab or sore itself  ) and right away after first application, the toe was softer and for the first time in years I could actually bend the darn thing!! I admit it,  I cried when I first bent it. I use it on that toe and it has helped my big toe be normal again. I cannot say it has cured my crusty heals but I think it makes the rest of my feet much softer...I&#x27;ll use a file on them NO PROBLEM, and the balm is fine too ( I soak that in with socks on ) and I truthfully say thanks TeleBrands! I like As Seen on TV products and most of them have been good silly fun and most of them have been pretty good to boot! I love pajama jeans too!! LOL thanks for helping me out, I mean that...wonderful Callous Clear really did help end my suffering!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a whim because I had seen the commercials and it was on sale.  I followed the directions.  The pads are too small.  When I tok off the pads, I saw there was dead skin I could scrape off.  In order to actually get any of the skin to come off with the scraper tool, I had to be quite vigerous.  The skin was coming up, but not off.  Eventually I got to a point were I had crevaces on my heel and the part just under my toes was bleeding, but there was still skin hanging on there.  So....my feet are in worse condition when I started and they weren&#x27;t bad to begin with.  I just thought it would take care of the bit of roughness I had in those spots and now my foot looks like I stuck it in a blender.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as expected...very disappointing.  There is clearly not enough of the self-sticking patches to cover enough area.  Would I try it again or recommend it...I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> The system is a beast that requires too much feeding. You will have to replace the pads, and every other aspect of this product. I switched to a micro-pedi callous remover. It&#x27;s quite dreamy by comparison.</li>
            <li> It took off &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; of the callus, and I did what the instructions said. I did like the lotion that it comes with, very lite. Not impressed.  Disappointed.  I think the commercials were a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> I have very hard callused heels and have to go for pedicures every couple of months where they use a razor blade to scrape all of the dead skin off. Thought I&#x27;d try this product in hopes of saving a few bucks on a couple of pedicures. NOT!!! What a waste of money! This may work for someone who has normal feet but then again why would you want to purchase this product if you have normal feet. I will be going back to the nail salon for my pedicures.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly and the product still did NOT work for me and my callous isn&#x27;t even a bad one! The lotion your suppose to put on afterwards does make your skin soft but I have regular lotion that does the same thing! It was a waste of money for me!</li>
            <li> My husband used this and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m getting tired of buying something that don&#x27;t work. DON&amp;#34;T!</li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t work I tried it right when it was delivered which came in today and it said wait for 10 minutes but I waited for 20 and it just didn&#x27;t work so ladies and gentlemen if you order this I&#x27;m sorry but this may not be useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad callouses on my right foot for five years-and the past year, my left foot has decided to try and match my right one in having the dreaded callouses. I used to have super cute, dainty feet. I adored showing them off. Until I began developing these ugly blemishes. I won&#x27;t even let my beloved husband play footsie or wear sexy shoes anymore. I have tried several products-the PedEgg, Sally Henson callous softener,etc. None have worked. I have even had to use nail scissors to cut some of the tough skin off. Then I found this product.&lt;br /&gt; I am really surprised with the negative reviews. For me this product worked extremely well. I had never heard of it before. Just bought it on a whim. I found the instructions very clear. It said to use about 1/4 of the softening gel on the pad, place the pad on the affected area, stick it down, and let it stay there for ten minutes. It said you should get approximtely 4 uses of the softening gel per package-perfect since it came with 4 pads. I followed the instructions exactly-except I did not use 1/4 the tube of gel. I instead used what I guessed would be a good amount. It just seemed senseless to use that much unless you have an inch thick callous. So I think if you use this product, use an amount that seems in proportion to the callous you are trying to remove- you can always reuse the pad and add more gel. Put the gel on the pad, attach it to the calloused areas, and set a timer for 10 mins. I slowly removed the first pad. Now here is the only part I had any confusion. I began to use the filing/pumice part because i misread the directions. I realized my mistake ver quickly and flipped the tool over. There is a hard plastic lip at the top of the tool. This is the scraper. Now you are supposed to scrape gently in a downward motion. I did that at first before I realized the best way to scrape the tough dead skin off is to scrape in whatever direction you want. And gently won&#x27;t do it. I had to use some pressure. Don&#x27;t use so much force that you hurt yourself. But don&#x27;t be afraid to work at it. When I was done, I still had some tough skin left. So I repeated the process-I even reused the pad. After the second treatment, I scraped again and to my surprise and delight, my callous was GONE. Completely. After that, I continued to follow the instructions. I used the filer side and buffed the area down. I use the other pad and repeated the same steps for another area on my right foot. I used the remaining two pads for my left foot. Again I foundn that if tfeehe callous isn&#x27;t fully removed after the gel has set and the initial scraping is done, add more gel, reuse the pad, and leave on formd.ow another ten minutes. Scrape again.&lt;br /&gt;After you do complete a treatment, don&#x27;t forget to use the lotion that comes with it. A little goes a long way. And it has left my feet softer and feeling super eqorriwj kmoisturuzed. My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years. I can&#x27;t wait to wear my flip flops and sexy sandals again. I am looking forward to rubbing m uy feet on my hubby again without feeling like I am going to scratch his legs. For me, this product really workedEverybody is different. Maybe some people didforn&#x27;t respond well to the callous softener. Maybe some didn&#x27;t follow directions correctly. It did seem people were expecetbting the product to act like it did in the demo video-like the skin would just slough off in sheets. And maybe for sseome that result will happen, I  don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t have sheets of skin coming off me like that-in fact, if that had happened, I probably woukdv&#x27;e freaked out. I had no preconceived notions on how the product was supposed to work. But for me, this product was a miracle for my feet. I will be ordering more kits-for mys inwelf, for my family, for my friends. My grandmother, my mom, my stepmom, my stedad and my real dad, my aunts and uncles, my friends,my husband (and he needs something good for his feet more than anybody I know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope thisreview helps. I have yet to ever purchase a product that works exactly how its demonstrated or advertixed. It&#x27;s a risk you akways take. But please don&#x27;t dismiss this product just because a few people claim it doesn&#x27;t work EXACTLY like a the demo video. Or because they can&#x27;t follow directions correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, my feet are better than the one in the commercial, and this product didn&#x27;t  do not nothing for them. Not any chance in my feet, I wasted my money with this product. They have to be  ashamed with their customers. And also smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product twice and it did do anything. I would not recommend it to anyone.  You would thing at least the lotion would do something to soften the feet but it does not.  VERY, VERY poor product</li>
            <li> it did not work for me. It did nothing,  it was a waste of my money. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product.  What a waste of time and money.  I&#x27;ll have to to back to soaking and using a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I certainly wish I had the read the reviews before buying this product! Nevertheless hope springs eternal. I waited until my recurring callous got to the point I couldn&#x27;t walk without pain and gave it a go. And I was nervous because I didn&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my foot! After the required wait time of ten minutes I pulled the scraper over the callous and... nothing happened. So I got my handy metal callous scraper and worked away at it. The kit comes with a sand paper scraper, so I used that as well. After 20 minutes or so of scraping the callous was marginally smoother. Perhaps the gel helped to soften it a bit, but so would soaking my foot in water. So it would seem P.T. Barnum had it right.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreen&#x27;s today for $9.99.  I treated my right foot first (focusing on my heel), following the directions, and the result was okay.  I *was* able to remove some skin with the scraper... but not as much as I expected.  I think the problem is the smallish size of the pad compared to my entire heel. Note: I wear a size 7 women&#x27;s shoe. The gel spreads out when the pad is applied, rather that staying on key areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I treated my left heel... and I freestyled this time, meaning I did not follow the instructions.  I applied the softener gel directly to my foot, waited 10 minutes and then scraped. The result was much better, but I still have a crack on each heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product is not a miracle worker when you apply one time.  I think this is a process that will have to be completed every other day Initially, and then go about your normal foot maintenance routine. I give it 3-1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff!!! My feet were horrible!!! I NEVER wear socks or tennis shoes so you can imagine what my feet look like!  I would never have payed full price for an As Seen on TV product so I purchase it on clearance.  However, now that I know th stuff works I will be more than happy to pay full price!  My feet haven&#x27;t looked this good in forever!!!!  Pads are small but I reused mine (on different spots in one sitting) so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Put it on and there is no difference than before.  Very disapointed I would not recomend at all.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I followed instructions exactly.  Nothing like the commercials.  The second time I left on about 45 minutes.  Not much better.  I think you would get just as good results soaking feet in hot water for an hour.</li>
            <li> I followed hkelly&#x27;s suggestion, and it worked for me on some nasty heels. It&#x27;s not 1-2-3 as the video suggests, and it took some time with a callous file, but the crack I had didn&#x27;t become a tear into tender skin as it has when I have been as aggressive with just the file. This is quicker and more effective than filing dry skin too. I will use this product again. I used a heavier-duty moisturizer in addition to the one included in this package.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this product. I followed the directions, but it didn&#x27;t remove the callous as easy as the infomercial. It would seem that it needed several applications to get it real smooth.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all so don&#x27;t waste your money, I ended up very disappointed, please people don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this would work, but it was half price at my grocery store, so I tried it.  Im glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full price!  It didn&#x27;t do one thing to change the condition of my feet. I even used a callous buffer first and not a bit of change.  I left it on for twice the recommended time and the only thing that happened when I used the scraper that came with the kit, was it got rid of some of the dirt that was caught in the cracks in my callouses, which made it APPEAR that it worked, but it did nothing.  DO: NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Its a rip off.</li>
            <li> Once again save your money, invest in a decent callous file instead.&lt;br /&gt;I spent $9.99 plus tax on this stuff and it didn&#x27;t do a thing, not a thing.&lt;br /&gt;My $2 file I bought at Walmart, plus soaking my feet and keeping at it did&lt;br /&gt;far more than this thing and the file is reusable.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff isn&#x27;t even worth one star but Amazon doesn&#x27;t give the option of no stars.&lt;br /&gt;Folks, save ya&#x27; money.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at all the negative reviews.. I take my shoes off the moment I get in the door and go barefoot daily.. we have hardwood  &amp; stone flooring so I have callouses.. I purchased this and the first time I used my feet were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! This works better than any pedicure I have ever gotten!! 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> Made my legs pulse up to the knee after using the cream.  Toxic!  Might work for others as I am very sensative.</li>
            <li> I excited to get, but once received, it did not work, very disappointed, would not recommend. Please do not purchase.</li>
            <li> This item is a waste, save your money and do a traditional foot soak and use a pumice stone or scraper. The cream is by no means a miracle, the scraper works great. They would have been better off just selling the scraper instead of making the cream seem like a miracle callus remover. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product does not work as seen on TV used it twice but was not impressed. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother. I tried this stuff repeatedly. I even left it on way longer than you&#x27;re suppose to. My callouses were just as hard as before and could not be removed without using a razor. It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>
            <li> who made this stuff, i cringe everytime i see the ad on tv, this product is useless, did not work at all, sorry,</li>
            <li> 1. \\&quot;a few minutes\\&quot; is all the instructions say.  tried first day - left on 15 min - no results&lt;br /&gt;2. tried again next day - left on 30 min (same area)  - no results&lt;br /&gt;3. tried again 3rd day - left on 1 hour (same area) - no results&lt;br /&gt;YOU BE THE JUDGE !&lt;br /&gt;ALSO SEE OTHER LESS THAN STELLAR REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;save some money ! send me the $10. - I will send you NOTHING ! THIS WILL WORK JUST AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;CANNOT REVIEW WITH 0 STARS - HAVE TO DO 1.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work. I applied it exactly as stated in the instructions and waited the correct amount of time. I scraped off nothing. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried this several ways. The first way was by the book. Followed the instructions but it seemed to do absolutely nothing. So I tried again. I started by soaking my foot until the callouses were softened a bit and more likely to absorg the product. I put a coating on and just left it. Nothing. I used it again immediately by the directions. Nothing again. I have now cut with scissors as much of the callous first. Next I will take a shower, and apply the stuff. I don&#x27;t have high expectations and this is far beyond what is required according to the instructions. If anything changes, I will edit this msg, but for now this is it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, doesn&#x27;t get any thing near a callous or roughness off of your feet, a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much difference in my heels after using this product. Really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my time and money</li>
            <li> The high-gloss rubber and sleek silhouette has transfomed these overshoes from mere galoshes to fashion-statement footwear. When I first saw a friend of mine wearing them I complimented him on his shoes, not realiIng they were Totes!</li>
            <li> It solved all my dry skin heel problems. The scrubber takes out all the dead skin very efficiently. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> buy a pad large enough to cover bottom of feet and apply a generous amount of coconut butter put the pad on and put on socks while grabbing your toes to keep the pad in place leave it on your feet for a full hour and scrape your feet with a plastic scraper. Do not waste your cash. baby lotion also works well but is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is a total rip off, the only thing that comes off is the the cream that you put on. Just go out and get yourself a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I have messed up heals and this product didn&#x27;t cure my problem.  It&#x27;s a tool for your feet it might work if your heals are just rough not cracked.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like it showed on TV at all. I think maybe if you soaked your feet first and then applied it, it might work better but even so, I still don&#x27;t think you will see the results they showed on TV.</li>
            <li> My feet were falling off because they were rotting right out of my shoes! Then BAM, I got Callous Clear and I was able to scrape the rotting lizard skin right off my feet! Thank you Telebrands for giving us Callous Clear.</li>
            <li> Not like the commercial at all!! I does not work any different than soaking your feet in a foot bath.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing I mean nothing at all but make a gooey mess scraper is a joke, pads are to small and the product doesn&#x27;t work  I informed Walgreens not to sell this product</li>
            <li> i have THE most calloused feet in the world My feet were badly burned several years ago &amp; since then, my heels will split &amp; crack deeply Painful, as well as ugly Ive found nothing that works on my callouses until now Im MORE than happy with this product im amazed! For those of you who dont want to try it, using strait hot vinegar, soaking in it, then using a ped egg or something similar works very well, but has a few def draw backs Vinegar is very choking, and smells up your house It also stings horribly if you have any nicks &amp; cuts on your feet. Idk wuts in callous clear, but it has no odor, doesnt burn at all, (in fact you dont even feel anything)I followed the directions to the tee, and will b buying this product again and again... :)</li>
            <li> This product does not work as it says it does.  I have tried several products, some worked, some did not.  This one falls under the did not work category.  While the foot cream is pretty good you can get foot cream much cheaper.  The softener gel and scrapper is a real joke, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My guess is that the people writing the negative reviews need to read and follow the instructions.  Callous Clear is great and works well if you follow the simple instructions.  Apply Callous Clear cream to the removal patch, place the on the calloused area and it softens and moisturizes your feet. Callous Clear penetrates into the hard, calloused areas, softening and lifting so that, the calluses peel away. Then, simply file for a smooth, soft finish and apply the soothing Callous Clear heel balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very simple to use and it works well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap. It does not work, the only thing it does is make a mess.  I have turned to using a sander on my callous&#x27;essave your money DON NOT PURCHASE. I have also contacted Telebrands to envoke the 100% satisfaction garentee and even that is crap. I have to pay to ship it back to them, the shipping is going to cost as much as the product originally did.</li>
            <li> The product works well. I&#x27;ve had acid treatments on my feet when getting a pedicure. So after reading the negative reviews decided to try my own method based a on how they do it at the spa with similar product.I did not use the pads or scraper that is included. I decided to use a traditional foot file.&lt;br /&gt;1) I applied the gel directly to my feet and waited 5 minutes (on thickest areas of the callous and cracked heels)&lt;br /&gt;2) used a large foot file and filed the calluses of my feet, it removed about 80% without much effort&lt;br /&gt;3) I soaked feet in  a basin with warm water to remove any residue and filed a bit more in the rougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;4) rinse and dried feet. applied cream. Feet look and feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;its more work than on Tv but faster than a traditional pedicure and my feet are still smooth after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I might try leaving a little bit longer next time, I think that way I would just wash residue and not have to file a bit more. I was afraid to leave it to long or get it on the softer areas because it could burn.&lt;br /&gt;This gel quickly penetrates the callous better than any other callous remover on the market, and I have tried many. It left my feet very smooth. English is my second language so I apologize for any mistakes.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the use of this product and it did not work at all!  I should&#x27;ve been suspicious when I saw there was no guarantee printed on the package or in any of the literature that was inside. Thanks Callous Clear!  I have the same ugly callouses I had before I used your product!  On the up side, the foot balm smells nice and will be good for hand lotion, but I doubt if it does anything for callouses so I guess it isn&#x27;t a complete loss!</li>
            <li> I just doesn&#x27;t work at all, completely fake. The pads are barely enough for one foot and the ads showing skin peeling away are clearly special effects to help mugs like me part with my money</li>
            <li> hello i use this product  a few days ago and it doesn&#x27;t works, please don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money... try something diferent</li>
            <li> Doesnt work. You put the gel on your feet and what you scrape off is the gel not the hard skin on your feet. Not worth it do not buy!!</li>
            <li> What a big waste of money.  I followed directions.  There is only enough product for 1 time use.  You could get a pedicure for that or buy a little bottle of callus remover in the regular drug store for $4 which works better.  The scraper hurts.  I highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of products from Amazon over the years, and have never written a single product review - until now.  I&#x27;d be remiss if I didn&#x27;t let everyone know that this product is complete garbage.  You&#x27;d have better luck removing your callouses with the dull edge of a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li> This product is GARBAGE and did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and my callous isn&#x27;t that bad (just standard heel build up from wearing high heels).  Going back for a refund tomorrow.  No visible peeling, as depicted in the TV commercial.  Go have the acid treatment they do in salons; my friend did and said the the skin peeled off in droves.  That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m headed next.  I&#x27;d give this a ZERO rating if available. DON&#x27;T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS JUNK THAT DOES NOTHING.</li>
            <li> This does not work.  You&#x27;re better off soaking your feet in hot water and putting a good lotion on them.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do the job I expected  they just didn&#x27;t get soft and crape off  I would not order it again</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT...AMAZING HOW IT  REALLY TOOK THE CALLOUSES OFF OF MY HEELS.....AND THEY WERE BAD.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN VERY SOON.</li>
            <li> 2 times 0 is 0.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I can&#x27;t give it 0 stars.  Had the same effect as smearing shampoo on my foot and leaving it for 15 mins.  No change in the skin.  Plenty got on various areas of non-calloused skin and also had no effect (generally anything acidic would at least cause a tingle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth my time to ask for the $12 back, but if anyone finds themselves near the founder&#x27;s home, you may want to do the world a favor and burn it down.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of my time and money. Did not work at all. Tried one pad on one foot for 10 minutes (like the directions indicated) and nothing happened. Tried a second pad on the second foot for 25 minutes, still no difference. I will stick to my Avon Foot Works products, at least those work.</li>
            <li> I hope this saves at least one person their time and money. I bought it and being somewhat skeptical, I left it on for 20 rather than the 10 minutes it directs you to. My callous problem was minor compared to the ones shown on their ad and I got zero results from using this product. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  If it&#x27;s not working for you, you must have gotten a bad batch or are doing it wrong. This stuff works.  I will never pay to have this done at the salon again. WOOOHOOO</li>
            <li> Did not work very efficiently. It took more of the product to get desired results than the directions required.... I think it&#x27;s close to a complete rip off!</li>
            <li> I used this product as it was  directed. It didn&#x27;t work the way ot&#x27;s advertised, and I caution anyone who considers this product to look at higher end products.This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better, but this does not work. Not even a little bit, no good, don&#x27;t waste time or money</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and it worked wonders. I followed the directions exactly and made my feet baby soft. My mom used it after me and it worked on her too. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. Do not not bother it does not work! The commercial looks very convincing but this product is definitely a rip off.</li>
            <li> this product It&#x27;s not even worth the time that I am taking to write this review. It just doesn&#x27;t work, seriously save your money.</li>
            <li> Hate it, it doesn&#x27;t work @ all everything they was saying about it not true, and please save your money.</li>
            <li> It works but no where near as easy as the commercial so 1 star off because of that, you know they exaggerate to get you to buy the product. I&#x27;ve had this for over a moth finally decided to use it tonight. And it actually works if you put a little work into it after you use the softer and pads that covered  my heals where the majority of my callous is from wearing sandals and at time bare feet around the house. After one treatment my feet are 80 percent smooth, one more treatment I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have any callous if I just keep up on my weekly home pedicures. I left the softening gel and pads on for about 15-20 minutes didn&#x27;t pay attention to time, I believe it&#x27;s supposed to be ten minutes, then I used the scraper and it scrapes more than just gel but the callouses off not like the commercial but like you have to put in a medium amount of work scrapping ( another star off because of this, the commercial makes it look like it just sloughs off,no such luck) then filing/sand your feet smooth once finished sanding then apply the foot balm and my feel feel so much nicer. I would buy again, worth the purchase. Pedicures at the spa or salon cost more.</li>
            <li> I think this product works great! I was initially deterred by the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  First off, you have to make sure to put the pads directly on the callus which can be kind of a tricky task as the pads are a strange shape. However, I managed to get them directly on the balls of my feet and heels (where I had unsightly calluses). Keept  them on for about 10 minutes, slightly longer than recommended. I took them off and my feet where so soft! I attempted to use their pumice stone but it was a joke ( I ended up throwing it out). I purchased a callus shaver by clear away on Amazon, which I ended up using to file my feet some more. End result was fantastic! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK THAT WELL. MY FEET WERE SOFT EVERYWHERE EXCEPT WHERE THE CALLOUSES WERE. I STILL HAD CRACKS AND GROOVES AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I was sold andI ordered this product after seeing its infomercial on TV. I got the product in 2 days and opened it right away. I read and followed the instruction as written and they even showed it on the infomercial how easy it is. After several tries and application, this product did not remove my callous at all. I felt let down and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local pharmacy for twice the price it&#x27;s offered here. That was my second mistake. My first mistake was not seeing that this was one of those As Seen On TV things. Had I noticed that logo, I&#x27;d have not made the purchase. Sadly I didn&#x27;t realize it until I had already unwrapped it. Either way this product doesn&#x27;t work. I only have minor callouses and despite trying this twice, it did nothing. The first time I tried it, was as directed. The second time I soaked my feet until the callouses were soft first. Neither application did anything. I was left with smelly feet from the lotion and it wasn&#x27;t a good smell at all. Reminded me of 80&#x27;s perm solution. Blech. Save your money and time and skip this product.</li>
            <li> Worked good. I do not have super hard or super thick hard skin to begin with but my winter feet were in need of some love. My feet were dry and rough. It softened the top layer enough to remove that skin easily and left my feet very soft and smooth.  Going to use it on my boyfriend next. I will update if it worked good on his man feet.</li>
            <li> Wasted the money and only worked for a few days then needed to do it again. They don&#x27;t give you enough to do it as often as I needed to.</li>
            <li> I decided to only use this on one heal just to test it.  Here are my problem.  The instructions do NOT tell you how long to leave it on so before I used it I went to their web site and there was nothing there.  Then I searched the internet and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything  that says how long to leave the gel on.  After searching other reviews, I did find a few people that tried 10-15 minutes.  I didnt want to burn or mess up my foot so I stuck with 15 minutes.  The first problem starts with the pads. They are not big enough for my heal and my feet are not that large.  So when I put the gel on the pad and put on my foot, it didnt cover the entire outside of my heal and mainly went on the bottom of my foot.  The other issue is the amount of gel to put on.  I tried to put on enough so that it could penetrate and work barely 1/6th of what comes in the bottle.  When I put the pad on, and tried to stick it to to the sides of my ankle, the gel started seeping out and then the pad would not stick so I had to hold it in place.  After the 15 minutes, I follows the instruction and used the scrapper but nothing peeled of like you see in the videos.  when I was finished and put on the lotion, my foot looked a little bit better but when I compared both heals, I didnt see any difference after 2 days.  Maybe it was the time I left it on or maybe I didnt put enough gel on but either way, it was a mess.  I will try it again on the other foot and use a second overside bandage to hold it in place for maybe 20-25 minutes and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This thing works. It makes the dead skin soft so that you can take it off with the scraper. It works on me so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It truly smooths and softens the feet. I have been recommending it to everyone. 5 stars for this product.</li>
            <li> I have huge callouses on my heels and this did not remove any of them. Back to the drawing board to find something that works.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!  I&#x27;ve been battling my dry cracked feet for months!  I&#x27;ve tried wearing socks with vaseline, I&#x27;ve tried soaking them in epson salt and mouthwash and vinegar. So far this is the only thing that has been able to remotely remove the dead skin.  I did as the directions said but left it on for approx 30 minutes rather than 10 because my feet are so bad.  I used the scraper and skin started coming off immediately.  I may have to do one more treatment to completely remove the dead skin from my cracked heel but it&#x27;s 90% softer and smoother.  I wish that you got more than just 1 treatment per foot but I&#x27;m about to stock up as my feet are softer than they have ever felt after any treatment, even a spa pedicure which I used to get twice a month!  It&#x27;s worth it but leave it on much longer than 10 minutes if your feet are bad.  I did and it did not burn my feet at all, even in the softer areas.</li>
            <li> Great. Have used this before. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, but it does work to a degree</li>
            <li> This did not work as well as I had hoped.  I hoping it would increase the amount of time between professional pedicure.  Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that really works. I usually go for pedicures every few weeks but with Callous Clear I save money by not having to go that often.  It most definitely makes my feet softer and life easier.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much it worked just like it advertised with ease.  I put it on and it came right off with great ease happy feet.</li>
            <li> I saw the ads on TV and sounded great. It did not do what it said, and is no different than the callous remover I get during a pedicure. the pads don&#x27;t stick on well, I used the tube several times before I got a visible result. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> NOTHING like advertised on TV. All it did was make my callouses soft but they did not peel off like seen on TV.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my kit but It didn&#x27;t work at all. I felt frustrated and foolish. I saw too many times the advertisement that I got caught; however, the item is a ripoff.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. There was not enough product for even one completed application, the pads were too small to cover the feet and not all the callous was removed despite following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> Once you put the gel on the pad and then put that on your foot, the gel is supposed to dry up so that when you strip it, the callous comes along with it. However, after waiting for like forever with the thing on my foot, the gel never dried. It does leave your foot somewhat softer but it&#x27;s not worth it. Overall, its a messy and disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last month I tried using it I have no clue but this product didn&#x27;t work. I do not have much callous to remove I tried using this product and it didn&#x27;t remove anything it was just messy. The next week after trying this product I still had to go to do a pedicure. SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND EFFORT LIKE I DID.</li>
            <li> Did not workwaste of money and time.what a scam on tvdo not buy this product eversave your moneytake it off your products</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your.money go to the drugstore and spend half the money thumbs down..I was very disappointed but how do you return something like this lol</li>
            <li> It is a SCAM!!! Does not work at all. I used it 3 different times and each time nothing changed,the gel just rubbed off. Callous thick skin still in tact!!!  I called to inquire about a refund and  was told they only return money if the product is un-opened.  I was definitely robbed!!!</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed. I saw the commercial for this product and was very excited to use it. It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my foot feel gooey. :(</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. i like the balm though, it feels good on my feet and somehow leaves it smooth for a little bit</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. I followed the directions to the letter it did not work. I do not blame the seller I blame the product you are better off doing the buffing with a pumice stone or better yet get a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I used this product but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  Also, I only got about 2 uses out of it.  Not much product in the tubes.</li>
