            <li>This set is the best from what I owned so far.</li>

            <li>One of the things I love most about this tweezers set is that it comes with a carrying pouch.  </li>

            <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>even more so because I got them on sale.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great tweezers set!</li>
            <li>For most of my life, I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers.  </li>

            <li>Like the colors too! :)</li>
            <li>Love this company...</li>
            <li>The second set was perfect :</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a Co-Founder of Grooming District :-)</li>
            <li>This is an all in one set of tweezers for sure.</li>
            <li>I mostly use them for my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have bought many.</li>
            <li>I am saving them to give to him for Father’s Day, nevertheless, I opened them to make sure all was in order</li>
            <li>: they are okay.</li>
            <li>received this set for testing purposes, product seemed to work well, and was easy to hold, I&#x27;m glad to have been able to try this product and give my opinion on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li>They feel like good quality tweezers and they&#x27;re super precise.  </li>
            <li>They are very light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these already 6 times and just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li>but it is really neat with each fitting into it&#x27;s own handy pocket.  </li>
            <li>They came with a very nice black case that fits them great as seen in pictures.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these with a coupon I recieved!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some tweezers that have more of a needle-like point, but these are more than adequate for removing most splinters.</li>
            <li>Great for gift ideas and using in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>The price is great, The quality is great (surgical) and if you&#x27;re unhappy for any reason, John is committed to making you happy</li>
            <li>I love how precise they are.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t have a good grip on them.  </li>
            <li>The struggle is real when you are looking for a good set of tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will be perfect for any other tweezer need as well!</li>
            <li>A great set of tweezers that can actually grab fine hair!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the cute little case they come in.</li>
            <li>With these tweezers it’s so easy.</li>
            <li>They grip and remove the hairs easily.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are all comfy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the most useful for shaping my eyebrows, and I love that both are colored</li>
            <li>Since then, I tried the pointed tip and it worked just as easily.  </li>
            <li>I tried them because some people, who either got them for free, or have much, much thicker hair than I do, gave them good reviews, but none of the three would work at all.  </li>
            <li>When the package arrived the leather pouch they came in had a strong chemical odor that I did not care for and had to dispose of immediately.</li>
            <li>They aee made of strong material , well made.</li>
            <li>Complete set of (3) handy tweezers!</li>
            <li>They are very lightweight, and I love that each one has a different tip, which is perfect for grabbing hard-to-reach hairs.</li>
            <li>They have worked out perfect for me as Odie was due his haircut today!</li>
            <li>The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  </li>
            <li>All three were very sharp and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>super preciscion!</li>
            <li>All three are very well made, grip easy to make for easy removal, and come with a nice case to keep them all together.</li>
            <li>I was able to quickly get it out with the pointed silver tweezers.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I am a &amp;#34;tweezer snob.&amp;#34;  I have spent more money than I am willing to admit trying to find the perfect set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Not only are the colors great, but they are easy to grip and&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers, but what makes them really enjoy them is having them all together in the nice case it comes in.  </li>
            <li>Used the purple ones to refresh the eyebrows and they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Each different one has great attributes.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>I use the pointed tip tweezers to hold the nail tape securely and place it where I want it to be.</li>
            <li>so I have everything in a hotel room for the kids that would have at home to fit a button or get a splinter out.  </li>
            <li>These came available for purchase during a promotional period</li>
            <li>Yup, those cheap things have been a mainstay at my house.</li>
            <li>The tweezers feel comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li>The case holds all three of the tweezers securely.</li>
            <li>I am sure my husband is going to love having his own personal grooming set.</li>
            <li>The Gold Slant Tip is perfect for facial hair; it allows me to get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>my brother had a very fine metal sliver, got it out on first try.</li>
            <li>Perfect, I was only looking for one tweezer since my older was probably belonged to my mother, in all of its rusted glory.</li>
            <li>These are high quality tweezers that have a nice weight to them</li>
            <li>These are great quality and work far better than anything I have been able to find at local stores</li>
            <li>When I was offered this set as a promotional discount I was excited because it came with all three types of tweezers and a fancy case.</li>
            <li>What is even better is that, with the slanted tip pair, I am plucking hairs that I was not even aware were there at all.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect addition to my bag with three different tweezers to use for so many different things.  </li>
            <li>The set offers a Slant pair, Straight pair and a Pointed tip pair for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that the tips on all three in the set are super precise.</li>
            <li>They are of a high quality and very easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s easy to just grab the right one from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Key to a good looking brow.</li>
            <li>They have a good, solid feel to them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the straight tip yet, but I am sure it will work just as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try out these tweezers to evaluate, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set.</li>
            <li>These are very well made, and stylish.</li>
            <li>I loved these right away because they come with a case and are also a bright color, which makes it hard to lose.</li>
            <li>I like this set, it&#x27;s high quality and very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Different colors means that it is super easy to find the ones you want upon first glance.&lt;br /&gt;Securely packed for shipping which means no blunting on the edges from getting bounced around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spent a lot more $$ on a pair that was good, for the first 3 times used.</li>
            <li>The really pointy ones work great for any sort of ingrown or super short hair and</li>
            <li>The pointed, straight and angled &amp;#34;working ends&amp;#34; are designed for specific grooming applications which greatly widens and customizes their use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great set overall, perfect for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>These are color coded so I am able to grab the one most needed without a second thought.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and were packaged neatly.</li>
            <li>and it seems adequate</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to get these as I am always losing tweezers or don&#x27;t have the right ones I need.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers and recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>I always thought they worked fine since I didn&#x27;t know any better, but a few years ago, my sister got me a nice pair</li>
            <li>The pouch does not smell too pleasant, however this is not the first leather product I have received to have the same odor, and I imagine it will dissipate after some time.</li>
            <li>These do a great job tracking them down and keeping a hold on them.</li>
            <li>I try those first for everything!)  </li>
            <li>This set of tweezers are not only cute, but they are also functional!</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t let him take the whole kit, he loves the fine pointed pair for slivers and cactus.  </li>
            <li>I can grab fine facial hairs and pull them out almost pain free!  </li>
            <li>The slant tip worked amazing on my eyebrows and had a nice tight grip which the ladies know is really important!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The carrying case seems to be a little cheap but the tools are good quality.  </li>
            <li>also great success with the few splinters that have come our way.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tweezer set, they all work really well and grab hairs</li>
            <li>Prior to this purchase, I had one really nice set of tweezers that I kept in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>These were definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The silver pair will be great for removing splinters (one of the least comfortable tasks ever).</li>
            <li>wow, these are FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Not that I doubted that these would be better than my $2 drugstore tweezers, but they far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>They are for sure professional quality.  </li>
            <li>I received an email back from a nice gentleman from Grooming District named John Branch.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly purchase again for a gift, and I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The tips are sharp enough to ensure a strong hold of even fine hair, and the handles are the perfect width and length for a secure grip, which is my biggest complaint with most tweezers I have tried.</li>
            <li>The edges meet perfectly, allowing you to grab a single hair or splinter easily and firmly for removal.  </li>
            <li>They also came with a nice black storage pouch to keep them organized and easily found.</li>
            <li>I spend a fraction of the time in front of the mirror because now I have the right tools for the job</li>
            <li>Not knowing what was in the package right away</li>
            <li>They go right into tour pocket or your purse.</li>
            <li>just right and get it pulled.  </li>
            <li>These are precisely made high quality tweezers and a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>really cool tool, pulls really well</li>
            <li>I love the little leather case that comes with it:)</li>
            <li>His first concern was to make things right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers to people who are familiar with name brands.</li>
            <li>They are made of stainless steel, have a nice heavier feel to them, and they are obviously aligned well.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a great kindness in my book as I didn&#x27;t have to make a trip to the local UPS office to send them back.</li>
            <li>I imagine they should be fine for most other uses though (pulling out stray hairs, or whatever else).  </li>
            <li>These came super fast and are really well made!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the very pointy ones, but that could very possibly be user error, and that still leaves the other two working wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love that there is different kinds in this set to make it easier for giving myself a makeover.</li>
            <li>The square tips are also OK, but they don&#x27;t meet at the edges all of the way across the surface so only one-half grasps well.</li>
            <li>The wife and girls love them, and they especially like the fact that they&#x27;re colored.  </li>
            <li>I love the different slants on these.</li>
            <li>Yes that is my first reaction.</li>
            <li>my we found the first tick on our dog.</li>
            <li>First set arrived with the pointed set&#x27;s tips misaligned.  </li>
            <li>They actually worked better than these without the coating because I could press in without that discomfort</li>
            <li>The slant pair worked ok on eyebrows but not on facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I love that they are all a different color.</li>
            <li>The hairs came out of the first go around instead of having to try and grab them a couple times.</li>
            <li>However, the straight and pointy tip pairs do not work at all!</li>
            <li>look of the tweezers are very colorful and professional looking&lt;br</li>
            <li>The purple straight tip are very handy for picking up small batteries or eye glasses screws.  </li>
            <li>just right making using them a real pain..</li>
            <li>EZ to clean, feel firm in your grasp, strong grip, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>the other too are great for just regular grooming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The straight pair of tweezers is flat on top</li>
            <li>These are sharp, very sturdy and come in a really nice case.</li>
            <li>The tweezer tips seem precisely machined and strong, but for more delicate jobs (pulling out a fine splinter for example) even the most thinly pointed tweezer was too blunted.</li>
            <li>They are all great quality in all areas- sharp ends where they should be, flat ends where it should be, etc.</li>
            <li>I feel like they will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>if you hold them a certain way.</li>
            <li>Most of my tweezers get lost cause they are just loosely laying around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The featherweight design set comes with three stainless steel tweezers along with a nice black case for storage.  </li>
            <li>The versatility of having three different tweezers for your needs is super duper!  </li>
            <li>I like have the option to get a splinter out or pull some unwanted hair with all the different tips especially since they have metal tips that can be cleaned easily but soft cushion handles for holding and gripping.  </li>
            <li>The little tote it comes with is so handy.</li>
            <li>You get 3 in the nice little leather type case.</li>
            <li>The purple straight tip I use for precision removal of those tiny fine hairs that seem to fight me all the time.</li>
            <li>I could never get a good grip when tweezing – I would squeeze as hard as I could and still miss the hair, splinter, etc.</li>
            <li>The tweezers worked really well</li>
            <li>and they grip really well.</li>
            <li>I found the purple straight tip and the gold slanted tip</li>
            <li>However, a couple of days after I had decided that the silver ones were junk, my husband asked me to help him pull out an ingrown whisker that he couldn&#x27;t see very well.  </li>
            <li>so I find it works better for picking up nail art gems and applying them to wet nail polish.</li>
            <li>Case is very convenient addition too.</li>
            <li>One with very pointie end, for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Very fashionable.</li>
            <li>I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t say much about the case</li>
            <li>The Grooming District tweeters are stainless steel, no need to worry about rusting or damage.</li>
            <li>I really like this tweezer set.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, and durable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pluck that much</li>
            <li>The set includes one slant, one straight and one pointed tip.</li>
            <li>different tips, each provides a different function.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers came with a handy carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>These tweezers are nice &amp; heavy duty.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and the tweezers are not cheap</li>
            <li>In fact,  such good grip one must be careful not to pinch the skin.  </li>
            <li>I easily plucked brows, removed ingrown hairs, removed splinters, and even pulled ticks off of my kiddos after a long camping weekend.</li>
            <li>In edition to personal use, these would be perfect for gifts for family members- especially those with little ones!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out these tweezers as a sample because I use tweezers daily.</li>
            <li>I had some that were okay, and my husband used them for something or other and they stopped working as well, so it was time to start shopping around.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad as I got rid of all my other tweezers once I received these.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok - doesn&#x27;t grip as well as other tweezers</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these high quality tweezers with their versatility and usefulness!</li>
            <li>of course, and most importantly, they grip every teeny little hair you could possibly want to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased many other tweezers that end up after a few uses no longer able to grip items.  </li>
            <li>I love that they come with 3 different kinds for all different types of uses.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to purchase this 3-piece set during a promotional period.  </li>
            <li>so many times you splurge on tweezers only to find the ends are not calibrated when you can finally open the package - frustration...  </li>
            <li>The set comes with a very cool case where I can store the tweezers together and not lose them, which I have done plenty of times with other pairs I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The variety of styles will fit whatever need comes up, so a single purchase meets all uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They grab hairs nicely and there is less pain since hair is not slipping out.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this high quality and well made tweezers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are high quality and resonantly priced.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but they will definitely come in handy for other things</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus as I paid a lot money for other tweezers that didn&#x27;t grasp hairs nearly as well as these!!!</li>
            <li>I busted out the pointy tweezers a little alcohol and wha la likes Magic</li>
            <li>I love the little package they come in for travel or just hiding them from family members who always walk off with mine.</li>
            <li>I have so many little kits to pack when we take trips (every two weeks)</li>
            <li>I mean, they look nice, but who cares?  </li>
            <li>But I do live in a house with three girls</li>
            <li>After a hassle-free email exchange w grooming district&#x27;s customer service, a new set was promptly sent out.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t use tweezers much except to remove the occasional splinter or tiny foreign object from my hands or feet.  </li>
            <li>I love the case they come in because I can add a few things in there no problem and the case is soft</li>
            <li>The main reason I need tweezers is cause at my youthful older age apparently chin hairs grow.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with very fine eyebrow hairs that can be difficult to see in certain light.</li>
            <li>The silver pointed tip we use for first aide and tiny splinter mishaps.</li>
            <li>I had a new set and was told I could keep the old set as well.</li>
            <li>The little pouch they came in is very nice too, no more digging in the drawer looking for the tweezers (and it will hopefully keep my husband from noticing them and using them).</li>
            <li>I have very light colored hair, which is hard to find the stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>This little compact set of Tweezers are fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I have used them no less than 10 times since then!</li>
            <li>All 3 are different – one is pointed, one is slanted and one is straight.</li>
            <li>Not anymore, not only is this tweezer set affordable but you get the straight edge, slated edge and pointed ones to cover all your needs.</li>
            <li>They are professional quality.</li>
            <li>Grooming District Tweezers set complete bundle</li>
            <li>My 11 year old son tends to get splinters a lot and struggles with sitting still for me to remove the splinter.  </li>
            <li>The slanted pair has replaced my old pair for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>They are precise, grab the hair firmly and don&#x27;t slip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far they have all been used here.</li>
            <li>This item was received as part of a deal where I got a coupon for my review, and in my honest opinion these tweezers are better than my very expensive pairs!</li>
            <li>Since the pointed tip tweezers are so thin I can easily see exactly what I am doing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these for travel mainly for eyebrows and facial hair.</li>
            <li>The little case is a nice addition, too, and makes it easy to keep all three pairs of tweezers together - I&#x27;ve misplaced plenty of pairs in the past, and I can see that won&#x27;t be an issue for me now.</li>
            <li>Major plus.</li>
            <li>The set has 3 pair of tweezers (broad angled, narrow point, and wide flat) that each have their own specific purpose.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten something else, simple because my only use for tweezers tends to be for very delicate tasks.</li>
            <li>I barely squeeze the tweezers and it pulls the hair out by the root.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I found grooming district products by making a random purchase after receiving a discount code.</li>
            <li>I have avoided buying a &#x27;nice&#x27; set of tweezers because they are all so expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did because now my annoying piece of hair that keeps popping up is easily removed without a lot of pain for me.</li>
            <li>find that i lose them less when they come together like they do, and they work really well!  </li>
            <li>The flat tip of the tweezers lets me place the gem exactly where I want it to be, without jabbing into my wet nail</li>
            <li>These would also be really helpful with splinters, removing ticks, or other jobs that require precision.  </li>
            <li>Though I say blunt they really are perfectly sharp just with a horizontal tip.</li>
            <li>The first day I got these tweezers, I used the slanted tip on the little devil.  </li>
            <li>One of them is okay, but the other two are shoddy.</li>
            <li>Edges are sharp and grabs on tiny hairs very well.</li>
            <li>They gripped it firmly, refused to let it escape and pulled it out painlessly on the first try.  </li>
            <li>i mainly wanted the sharp tweezer, which is why i bought the set.  </li>
            <li>Stainless steel tips were very sharp and precise.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>There is a fine, flat, and slant tip pair that come in a neat little black case.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad.</li>

            <li> Product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance to buy these and couldn&#x27;t resist after getting a good coupon deal.</li>
            <li> but I would have purchased them for full price because they are great!</li>
            <li> However, I am much more concerned with the quality of the tweezers themselves and they are a great product.</li>
            <li> which is very important!</li>
            <li> The golden colored slanted tweezers work perfect for tweezing my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise they are great :)</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> great purchase :)</li>
            <li> Nice to have all three, good quality</li>
            <li> I am incredibly picky about my tweezers and was really excited to give a review when I was offered a coupon for these.  </li>
            <li> This tweezer set is a great price, and it seemed to have a lot of good reviews (from people who got them free or at a steep discount--</li>
            <li> and now we&#x27;ll actually be able to remove them!</li>
            <li> pointed tip is my favorite pair of tweezers in this set!</li>

            <li> The slant allows for a great grip upon the hair and precise removal.</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s when I discovered that the silver tweezers were amazing at getting under the skin to pull out the ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> found the precise control and defined edges were great</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this product available for review deal.</li>

            <li> These tweezers are by far the best tweezers I’ve ever owned and believe me – I’ve owned my fair share of tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I liked the variety of tips included.</li>
            <li> The angled ones have been perfect and make brow maintenance much easier.</li>
            <li> The storage case is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I loev that they came in a handy pouch so that I can keep them all together</li>
            <li> The leather pouch is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> They come with a nice carrying case and rubber ends to protect the tips.  </li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t found any downsides to these, so I will just tell you all the features</li>
            <li> /&gt;Similarly, they come with a handy case for travel or at home storage which will keep them in pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> This set is the best from what I owned so far.</li>
            <li> The first thing I checked out was how well the two sides of each tweezer lined up (this will make a huge difference with how well tweezers will remove a hair) and they are perfect matches!</li>
            <li> I love having every kind of tweezer I may need all in one kit.</li>
            <li> I was able to pick this set up on a promotion, so i was thrilled to try it.</li>

            <li> I stick to my drugstore ones and they get most hairs as I try to shape my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to know I have these as summer starts as well</li>

            <li> I gladly give it a raving review.</li>
            <li> I am stoked I was able to receive these tweezers during a promotional period, but I would gladly pay the asking price knowing what I know from using them.</li>
            <li> Apparently I do better with the cheapies from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> One of the things I love most about this tweezers set is that it comes with a carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li> When I opened this package, I was pleased with the quality of this product for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Their cute in their colors.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li> even more so because I got them on sale.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great tweezers set!</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers.  </li>
            <li> ends were banded or capped which is also great for keeping them in good condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find a multipurpose pack of three.</li>
            <li> and my husband works out in the desert, we needed more.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to be able to grab these during a promotional period!  </li>

            <li> and ive had many</li>
            <li> Great pricing and fast ship too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get more for holiday gifts Christmas/Hanukkah.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this set of three tweezers for free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Like the colors too! :)</li>
            <li> Love this company...</li>
            <li> The second set was perfect :</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a Co-Founder of Grooming District :-)</li>
            <li> This is an all in one set of tweezers for sure.</li>
            <li> I mostly use them for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have bought many.</li>
            <li> I am saving them to give to him for Father’s Day, nevertheless, I opened them to make sure all was in order</li>
            <li> : they are okay.</li>
            <li> received this set for testing purposes, product seemed to work well, and was easy to hold, I&#x27;m glad to have been able to try this product and give my opinion on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> They feel like good quality tweezers and they&#x27;re super precise.  </li>
            <li> They are very light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these already 6 times and just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li> but it is really neat with each fitting into it&#x27;s own handy pocket.  </li>
            <li> They came with a very nice black case that fits them great as seen in pictures.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these with a coupon I recieved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some tweezers that have more of a needle-like point, but these are more than adequate for removing most splinters.</li>
            <li> Great for gift ideas and using in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> The price is great, The quality is great (surgical) and if you&#x27;re unhappy for any reason, John is committed to making you happy</li>
            <li> I love how precise they are.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t have a good grip on them.  </li>
            <li> The struggle is real when you are looking for a good set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure will be perfect for any other tweezer need as well!</li>
            <li> A great set of tweezers that can actually grab fine hair!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the cute little case they come in.</li>
            <li> With these tweezers it’s so easy.</li>
            <li> They grip and remove the hairs easily.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are all comfy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the most useful for shaping my eyebrows, and I love that both are colored</li>
            <li> Since then, I tried the pointed tip and it worked just as easily.  </li>
            <li> I tried them because some people, who either got them for free, or have much, much thicker hair than I do, gave them good reviews, but none of the three would work at all.  </li>
            <li> When the package arrived the leather pouch they came in had a strong chemical odor that I did not care for and had to dispose of immediately.</li>
            <li> They aee made of strong material , well made.</li>
            <li> Complete set of (3) handy tweezers!</li>
            <li> They are very lightweight, and I love that each one has a different tip, which is perfect for grabbing hard-to-reach hairs.</li>
            <li> They have worked out perfect for me as Odie was due his haircut today!</li>
            <li> The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  </li>
            <li> All three were very sharp and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> super preciscion!</li>
            <li> All three are very well made, grip easy to make for easy removal, and come with a nice case to keep them all together.</li>
            <li> I was able to quickly get it out with the pointed silver tweezers.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a &amp;#34;tweezer snob.&amp;#34;  I have spent more money than I am willing to admit trying to find the perfect set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Not only are the colors great, but they are easy to grip and&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers, but what makes them really enjoy them is having them all together in the nice case it comes in.  </li>
            <li> Used the purple ones to refresh the eyebrows and they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Each different one has great attributes.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> I use the pointed tip tweezers to hold the nail tape securely and place it where I want it to be.</li>
            <li> so I have everything in a hotel room for the kids that would have at home to fit a button or get a splinter out.  </li>
            <li> These came available for purchase during a promotional period</li>
            <li> Yup, those cheap things have been a mainstay at my house.</li>
            <li> The tweezers feel comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li> The case holds all three of the tweezers securely.</li>
            <li> I am sure my husband is going to love having his own personal grooming set.</li>
            <li> The Gold Slant Tip is perfect for facial hair; it allows me to get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> my brother had a very fine metal sliver, got it out on first try.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I was only looking for one tweezer since my older was probably belonged to my mother, in all of its rusted glory.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tweezers that have a nice weight to them</li>
            <li> These are great quality and work far better than anything I have been able to find at local stores</li>
            <li> When I was offered this set as a promotional discount I was excited because it came with all three types of tweezers and a fancy case.</li>
            <li> What is even better is that, with the slanted tip pair, I am plucking hairs that I was not even aware were there at all.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect addition to my bag with three different tweezers to use for so many different things.  </li>
            <li> The set offers a Slant pair, Straight pair and a Pointed tip pair for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that the tips on all three in the set are super precise.</li>
            <li> They are of a high quality and very easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s easy to just grab the right one from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Key to a good looking brow.</li>
            <li> They have a good, solid feel to them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the straight tip yet, but I am sure it will work just as well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try out these tweezers to evaluate, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set.</li>
            <li> These are very well made, and stylish.</li>
            <li> I loved these right away because they come with a case and are also a bright color, which makes it hard to lose.</li>
            <li> I like this set, it&#x27;s high quality and very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Different colors means that it is super easy to find the ones you want upon first glance.&lt;br /&gt;Securely packed for shipping which means no blunting on the edges from getting bounced around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spent a lot more $$ on a pair that was good, for the first 3 times used.</li>
            <li> The really pointy ones work great for any sort of ingrown or super short hair and</li>
            <li> The pointed, straight and angled &amp;#34;working ends&amp;#34; are designed for specific grooming applications which greatly widens and customizes their use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great set overall, perfect for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> These are color coded so I am able to grab the one most needed without a second thought.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly and were packaged neatly.</li>
            <li> and it seems adequate</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to get these as I am always losing tweezers or don&#x27;t have the right ones I need.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers and recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I always thought they worked fine since I didn&#x27;t know any better, but a few years ago, my sister got me a nice pair</li>
            <li> The pouch does not smell too pleasant, however this is not the first leather product I have received to have the same odor, and I imagine it will dissipate after some time.</li>
            <li> These do a great job tracking them down and keeping a hold on them.</li>
            <li> I try those first for everything!)  </li>
            <li> This set of tweezers are not only cute, but they are also functional!</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t let him take the whole kit, he loves the fine pointed pair for slivers and cactus.  </li>
            <li> I can grab fine facial hairs and pull them out almost pain free!  </li>
            <li> The slant tip worked amazing on my eyebrows and had a nice tight grip which the ladies know is really important!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The carrying case seems to be a little cheap but the tools are good quality.  </li>
            <li> also great success with the few splinters that have come our way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezer set, they all work really well and grab hairs</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase, I had one really nice set of tweezers that I kept in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> These were definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The silver pair will be great for removing splinters (one of the least comfortable tasks ever).</li>
            <li> wow, these are FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Not that I doubted that these would be better than my $2 drugstore tweezers, but they far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> They are for sure professional quality.  </li>
            <li> I received an email back from a nice gentleman from Grooming District named John Branch.</li>
            <li> I would most certainly purchase again for a gift, and I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The tips are sharp enough to ensure a strong hold of even fine hair, and the handles are the perfect width and length for a secure grip, which is my biggest complaint with most tweezers I have tried.</li>
            <li> The edges meet perfectly, allowing you to grab a single hair or splinter easily and firmly for removal.  </li>
            <li> They also came with a nice black storage pouch to keep them organized and easily found.</li>
            <li> I spend a fraction of the time in front of the mirror because now I have the right tools for the job</li>
            <li> Not knowing what was in the package right away</li>
            <li> They go right into tour pocket or your purse.</li>
            <li> just right and get it pulled.  </li>
            <li> These are precisely made high quality tweezers and a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> really cool tool, pulls really well</li>
            <li> I love the little leather case that comes with it:)</li>
            <li> His first concern was to make things right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers to people who are familiar with name brands.</li>
            <li> They are made of stainless steel, have a nice heavier feel to them, and they are obviously aligned well.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a great kindness in my book as I didn&#x27;t have to make a trip to the local UPS office to send them back.</li>
            <li> I imagine they should be fine for most other uses though (pulling out stray hairs, or whatever else).  </li>
            <li> These came super fast and are really well made!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the very pointy ones, but that could very possibly be user error, and that still leaves the other two working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love that there is different kinds in this set to make it easier for giving myself a makeover.</li>
            <li> The square tips are also OK, but they don&#x27;t meet at the edges all of the way across the surface so only one-half grasps well.</li>
            <li> The wife and girls love them, and they especially like the fact that they&#x27;re colored.  </li>
            <li> I love the different slants on these.</li>
            <li> Yes that is my first reaction.</li>
            <li> my we found the first tick on our dog.</li>
            <li> First set arrived with the pointed set&#x27;s tips misaligned.  </li>
            <li> They actually worked better than these without the coating because I could press in without that discomfort</li>
            <li> The slant pair worked ok on eyebrows but not on facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I love that they are all a different color.</li>
            <li> The hairs came out of the first go around instead of having to try and grab them a couple times.</li>
            <li> However, the straight and pointy tip pairs do not work at all!</li>
            <li> look of the tweezers are very colorful and professional looking&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purple straight tip are very handy for picking up small batteries or eye glasses screws.  </li>
            <li> just right making using them a real pain..</li>
            <li> EZ to clean, feel firm in your grasp, strong grip, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> the other too are great for just regular grooming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The straight pair of tweezers is flat on top</li>
            <li> These are sharp, very sturdy and come in a really nice case.</li>
            <li> The tweezer tips seem precisely machined and strong, but for more delicate jobs (pulling out a fine splinter for example) even the most thinly pointed tweezer was too blunted.</li>
            <li> They are all great quality in all areas- sharp ends where they should be, flat ends where it should be, etc.</li>
            <li> I feel like they will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> if you hold them a certain way.</li>
            <li> Most of my tweezers get lost cause they are just loosely laying around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The featherweight design set comes with three stainless steel tweezers along with a nice black case for storage.  </li>
            <li> The versatility of having three different tweezers for your needs is super duper!  </li>
            <li> I like have the option to get a splinter out or pull some unwanted hair with all the different tips especially since they have metal tips that can be cleaned easily but soft cushion handles for holding and gripping.  </li>
            <li> The little tote it comes with is so handy.</li>
            <li> You get 3 in the nice little leather type case.</li>
            <li> The purple straight tip I use for precision removal of those tiny fine hairs that seem to fight me all the time.</li>
            <li> I could never get a good grip when tweezing – I would squeeze as hard as I could and still miss the hair, splinter, etc.</li>
            <li> The tweezers worked really well</li>
            <li> and they grip really well.</li>
            <li> I found the purple straight tip and the gold slanted tip</li>
            <li> However, a couple of days after I had decided that the silver ones were junk, my husband asked me to help him pull out an ingrown whisker that he couldn&#x27;t see very well.  </li>
            <li> so I find it works better for picking up nail art gems and applying them to wet nail polish.</li>
            <li> Case is very convenient addition too.</li>
            <li> One with very pointie end, for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Very fashionable.</li>
            <li> I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t say much about the case</li>
            <li> The Grooming District tweeters are stainless steel, no need to worry about rusting or damage.</li>
            <li> I really like this tweezer set.</li>
            <li> They are very well made, and durable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pluck that much</li>
            <li> The set includes one slant, one straight and one pointed tip.</li>
            <li> different tips, each provides a different function.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers came with a handy carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> These tweezers are nice &amp; heavy duty.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and the tweezers are not cheap</li>
            <li> In fact,  such good grip one must be careful not to pinch the skin.  </li>
            <li> I easily plucked brows, removed ingrown hairs, removed splinters, and even pulled ticks off of my kiddos after a long camping weekend.</li>
            <li> In edition to personal use, these would be perfect for gifts for family members- especially those with little ones!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out these tweezers as a sample because I use tweezers daily.</li>
            <li> I had some that were okay, and my husband used them for something or other and they stopped working as well, so it was time to start shopping around.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad as I got rid of all my other tweezers once I received these.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok - doesn&#x27;t grip as well as other tweezers</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these high quality tweezers with their versatility and usefulness!</li>
            <li> of course, and most importantly, they grip every teeny little hair you could possibly want to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased many other tweezers that end up after a few uses no longer able to grip items.  </li>
            <li> I love that they come with 3 different kinds for all different types of uses.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to purchase this 3-piece set during a promotional period.  </li>
            <li> so many times you splurge on tweezers only to find the ends are not calibrated when you can finally open the package - frustration...  </li>
            <li> The set comes with a very cool case where I can store the tweezers together and not lose them, which I have done plenty of times with other pairs I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The variety of styles will fit whatever need comes up, so a single purchase meets all uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They grab hairs nicely and there is less pain since hair is not slipping out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this high quality and well made tweezers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are high quality and resonantly priced.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but they will definitely come in handy for other things</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus as I paid a lot money for other tweezers that didn&#x27;t grasp hairs nearly as well as these!!!</li>
            <li> I busted out the pointy tweezers a little alcohol and wha la likes Magic</li>
            <li> I love the little package they come in for travel or just hiding them from family members who always walk off with mine.</li>
            <li> I have so many little kits to pack when we take trips (every two weeks)</li>
            <li> I mean, they look nice, but who cares?  </li>
            <li> But I do live in a house with three girls</li>
            <li> After a hassle-free email exchange w grooming district&#x27;s customer service, a new set was promptly sent out.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t use tweezers much except to remove the occasional splinter or tiny foreign object from my hands or feet.  </li>
            <li> I love the case they come in because I can add a few things in there no problem and the case is soft</li>
            <li> The main reason I need tweezers is cause at my youthful older age apparently chin hairs grow.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with very fine eyebrow hairs that can be difficult to see in certain light.</li>
            <li> The silver pointed tip we use for first aide and tiny splinter mishaps.</li>
            <li> I had a new set and was told I could keep the old set as well.</li>
            <li> The little pouch they came in is very nice too, no more digging in the drawer looking for the tweezers (and it will hopefully keep my husband from noticing them and using them).</li>
            <li> I have very light colored hair, which is hard to find the stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> This little compact set of Tweezers are fantastic.</li>
            <li> but I have used them no less than 10 times since then!</li>
            <li> All 3 are different – one is pointed, one is slanted and one is straight.</li>
            <li> Not anymore, not only is this tweezer set affordable but you get the straight edge, slated edge and pointed ones to cover all your needs.</li>
            <li> They are professional quality.</li>
            <li> Grooming District Tweezers set complete bundle</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son tends to get splinters a lot and struggles with sitting still for me to remove the splinter.  </li>
            <li> The slanted pair has replaced my old pair for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> They are precise, grab the hair firmly and don&#x27;t slip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far they have all been used here.</li>
            <li> This item was received as part of a deal where I got a coupon for my review, and in my honest opinion these tweezers are better than my very expensive pairs!</li>
            <li> Since the pointed tip tweezers are so thin I can easily see exactly what I am doing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel mainly for eyebrows and facial hair.</li>
            <li> The little case is a nice addition, too, and makes it easy to keep all three pairs of tweezers together - I&#x27;ve misplaced plenty of pairs in the past, and I can see that won&#x27;t be an issue for me now.</li>
            <li> Major plus.</li>
            <li> The set has 3 pair of tweezers (broad angled, narrow point, and wide flat) that each have their own specific purpose.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten something else, simple because my only use for tweezers tends to be for very delicate tasks.</li>
            <li> I barely squeeze the tweezers and it pulls the hair out by the root.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I found grooming district products by making a random purchase after receiving a discount code.</li>
            <li> I have avoided buying a &#x27;nice&#x27; set of tweezers because they are all so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did because now my annoying piece of hair that keeps popping up is easily removed without a lot of pain for me.</li>
            <li> find that i lose them less when they come together like they do, and they work really well!  </li>
            <li> The flat tip of the tweezers lets me place the gem exactly where I want it to be, without jabbing into my wet nail</li>
            <li> These would also be really helpful with splinters, removing ticks, or other jobs that require precision.  </li>
            <li> Though I say blunt they really are perfectly sharp just with a horizontal tip.</li>
            <li> The first day I got these tweezers, I used the slanted tip on the little devil.  </li>
            <li> One of them is okay, but the other two are shoddy.</li>
            <li> Edges are sharp and grabs on tiny hairs very well.</li>
            <li> They gripped it firmly, refused to let it escape and pulled it out painlessly on the first try.  </li>
            <li> i mainly wanted the sharp tweezer, which is why i bought the set.  </li>
            <li> Stainless steel tips were very sharp and precise.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> There is a fine, flat, and slant tip pair that come in a neat little black case.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad.</li>
            <li> last set I bought locally was coated all the way to the tip with the inside still uncoated, so I could press against skin and it didn&#x27;t scratch, but they could still grab very little things very well.  </li>
            <li> With these tweezers removal is much easier and goes faster - which helps because it reduces the time I need the little ones to hold still!</li>
            <li> They have you covered with straight, slant, and small tip.</li>
            <li> I use the flat tweezers for betweens my two brows to get rid of those hairs that cause a unibrow.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> And finally, they come with a small soft case that holds all three.  </li>
            <li> What a complete waste of time.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers must be sharp enough, but not too sharp to cut the tiny piece of nail, in order to remove that part of my toenail.  </li>
            <li> i tried using the slanted ones, but i personally prefer the sharp one for eyebrow maintenance; i gave this set away to a family member.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a decent tweezer?</li>
            <li> They are so durable that I have no doubt they will last for a very long time!!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes cheaply made tweezers won&#x27;t pull a single hair out, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Every single pair of the tweezers in this set are durable and made of a thicker metal that gives them a precision alignment, ensuring that the tips meet every time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pluck one single hair.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are sharp and versatile, recently used them to take out sharp piece of glass from my foot.</li>
            <li> Facial hair slips if I don&#x27;t squeeze fairly tightly.</li>
            <li> And the 3 tweezers set fits well into the little enclosed pouch which had extra space to allow for scissors or emery boards storage all in one isolated location.</li>
            <li> Having the different tips makes getting all of those stubborn little hair&lt;</li>
            <li> They also come with a rubber end to hold the end closed and for protection.</li>
            <li> and I have to come back to it in a few days.</li>
            <li> A wide pinching grip area.</li>
            <li> I have about ten pairs of tweezers, partially because some that I&#x27;ve purchased have been junk and partially because my family members can&#x27;t seem to keep track of small items.  </li>
            <li> The tip of the pointed tweezer is sharp so be careful not to stab your self with them.</li>
            <li> I had to take a sliver out of my daughters hand the other day and</li>
            <li> It usually takes numerous attempts to get ahold of it</li>
            <li> The pointed tweezers didn&#x27;t work at all because one side was longer than the other.  </li>
            <li> Blunt, sharp, and angled.</li>
            <li> The sharp for splinter in my forearm, the blunt for a splinter on my daughters hand that had her freaking out, she hates pointy tweezers.</li>
            <li> They might be a little harder to loose that way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found in the past with other tweezers they don&#x27;t close completely across the surface, so you may end up with gaps that allow that stray hair or small splinter to escape.</li>
            <li> Now when I pluck the hard to see hairs, I only pluck hairs!</li>
            <li> The kids are outside all the time and splinters are quite common in our house.</li>
            <li> My previous pair (lost by the housekeeper in an unfortunate event) had a texture on the tip which improved the grip on tough or fine hair.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the silver pointed tip tweezers were pretty useless--they were terrible to use on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 pairs of tweezers that come in a little black leather case.</li>
            <li> My little guy went out to get the package UPS dropped off at the gate and got a splinter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to fight with him to sit still or make a little hole in his finger to pull it out.  </li>
            <li> This little kit has all that you would need in the Tweezer department.</li>
            <li> This came with a little faux suede carrying case.</li>
            <li> and they are like a missing sock..</li>
            <li> As described, they are uncomfortable to use close to the skin as the tips are completely uncoated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that every household needs tweezers.</li>
            <li> tweezers feel firm in your hand and does not &#x27;lose shape&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times and my thoughts sum up to</li>
            <li> I have had a few pairs of tweezers that were completely worthless right out of the package.</li>
            <li> tips are a little too thick for my liking making it a little hard to grip my eyebrow hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li> the tweezer tips are a little on the thick side they kept nicking my skin while tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pointed tip tweezers are useless as the two arms are different lengths and they do not meet at the tip at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how they made it out of the quality check process.</li>
            <li> I have bought tweezers in the past</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you have a small hair here and there with roots that must go all the way to my toes.  </li>
            <li> No more getting lost at the bottom/back of the drawer or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Had a small concern with the quality of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; of the three tweezers...</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than finding a hair, using a tweezers, and them to keep slipping off the hair.</li>
            <li> however, whipped out the silver pointed ones and popped that little sucker off!</li>
            <li> Those hard to grab eyebrow hairs to the ingrown hair on your husbands chin.</li>
            <li> One slanted set for hard to get.</li>
            <li> To make it worse, the little critter refuses to be pulled without a lot of perseverance and frustration, and I swear it keeps moving on me.  </li>
            <li> A problem I find with tweezers, often, is that they are not aligned well and end up not catching whatever I am trying to tweeze (like a hair or splinter).</li>
            <li> No more frustrating events of eyebrow tweezing for this girl.</li>
            <li> I like that they are different colors and not just boring black</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than a pair pair of tweezer-</li>
            <li> Some tweezers are poorly machined and the ends don&#x27;t meet up</li>
            <li> However, tweezers were poor quality.</li>
            <li> -o, but the grip on the angled tweezer is not great.</li>
            <li> The slanted ones just broke my eyebrow hairs, leaving behind stubs that the needle point couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Nail art tape is a struggle to work with, very thin and hard to place on a nail by just using my fingers.</li>
            <li> The slant ones help with thick hairs that usually broke off at the base and they helped get the root of the hair out.</li>
            <li> If the end of the tweezer is too thick it is almost impossible to remove his splinter.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I am returning them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve disappeared on me</li>
            <li> smell weird and don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> These are so competely useless they don&#x27;t even deserve one star.  </li>
            <li> it looks expensive and works well.</li>
            <li> These are basically useless.</li>
            <li> I just assumed they were all bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase and do not recommend the product</li>
            <li> Pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Worst tweezers ive ever had</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These tweezers are awesome!  I love that they come with 3 different kinds for all different types of uses.  The really pointy ones work great for any sort of ingrown or super short hair and the other too are great for just regular grooming.  I love these, so happy I purchased!</li>
            <li> Great colored tweezer set.&lt;br /&gt;3 different tips, each provides a different function.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers came with a handy carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift option.&lt;br /&gt;I received this set for testing purposes, product seemed to work well, and was easy to hold, I&#x27;m glad to have been able to try this product and give my opinion on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers, but what makes them really enjoy them is having them all together in the nice case it comes in.  I am incredibly picky about my tweezers and was really excited to give a review when I was offered a coupon for these.  I never had a set like this before and it&#x27;s really nice to have a selection.  It&#x27;s also really nice to have them all together.&lt;br /&gt;I find that i lose them less when they come together like they do, and they work really well!  You can tell they are nicely made and they don&#x27;t miss a hair.  There is nothing worse than a pair pair of tweezer- so don&#x27;t worry these do not disappoint.  They grab hairs nicely and there is less pain since hair is not slipping out.  I recommend this set.</li>
            <li> These tweezers were everything I could need in one perfect package. There is a fine, flat, and slant tip pair that come in a neat little black case. All three were very sharp and worked perfectly. I had to take a sliver out of my daughters hand the other day and the fine tip one was like a miracle in getting it out! The slant tip worked amazing on my eyebrows and had a nice tight grip which the ladies know is really important!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item after receiving a promotional code but the review is totally my own.</li>
            <li> I got this to review because I suffer with facial hair something fierce. I&#x27;m so glad that I did because now my annoying piece of hair that keeps popping up is easily removed without a lot of pain for me. I love that there is different kinds in this set to make it easier for giving myself a makeover. I highly recommend this high quality and well made tweezers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned tweezerman, so I can&#x27;t compare to that as others have. I can say these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve personally ever had. The case is handy and keeps them all in one spot, I feel like I am always buying tweezers and they are like a missing sock.. Nowhere to be found. They are made of strong metal and the tips match up perfectly and have no problem grabbing hair. I have had a few pairs of tweezers that were completely worthless right out of the package. I have a feeling these will last a very long time. I am thrilled that I found grooming district products by making a random purchase after receiving a discount code.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Everything I need in tweezers.  Came in on time and great shipping packed.</li>
            <li> The slant tip tweezers are very good. The pointed tip tweezers are useless as the two arms are different lengths and they do not meet at the tip at all. I&#x27;m not really sure how they made it out of the quality check process. The square tips are also OK, but they don&#x27;t meet at the edges all of the way across the surface so only one-half grasps well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a coupon I received as part of a promotion to use and review the item.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t use tweezers much except to remove the occasional splinter or tiny foreign object from my hands or feet.  But I do live in a house with three girls so tweezers are always  in short supply around my house.  The wife and girls love them, and they especially like the fact that they&#x27;re colored.  The wife says she gives them an A+!  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed about them.  They feel like good quality tweezers and they&#x27;re super precise.  Some tweezers are poorly machined and the ends don&#x27;t meet up just right making using them a real pain.. no pun intended!  Not these!  Even the tiniest ones line up perfectly and can get at even the smallest shard of glass.  Speaking from experience!  Also, the colored ones have kind of a texture to the surface making them easy to hold onto and manipulate.  Something I wouldn&#x27;t have thought about until I used these.  And finally, they come with a small soft case that holds all three.  They might be a little harder to loose that way!</li>
            <li> very good product! recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, I like different shaped tweezers and these are the best. I purchased these during a promotion and I am glad that I did. They are different colors and come with a carrying pack. I travel out of town and I place the pack in my makeup bag. They also come with a rubber end to hold the end closed and for protection. I have bought tweezers in the past but I have never found different slants of tweezers together in one package. I love the different slants on these. They are able to grasp whatever you need them for. Those hard to grab eyebrow hairs to the ingrown hair on your husbands chin. I may purchase more to put in Christmas stockings.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are by far the best tweezers I’ve ever owned and believe me – I’ve owned my fair share of tweezers. There are 3 pairs of tweezers that come in a little black leather case. So they are perfect for traveling. All 3 are different – one is pointed, one is slanted and one is straight. So they can accomplish ANYTHING!!!! This item was received as part of a deal where I got a coupon for my review and I couldn’t wait to review it. I’ve never owned a good pair of tweezers. I just assumed they were all bad. These tweezers have changed my life. They are great. With the last pair of tweezers I owned I could never get a good grip when tweezing – I would squeeze as hard as I could and still miss the hair, splinter, etc. With these tweezers it’s so easy. I barely squeeze the tweezers and it pulls the hair out by the root. These are great and I ‘m never buying another pair of tweezers again. I want to buy all of my girlfriends this set because they work so well. No more frustrating events of eyebrow tweezing for this girl.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out these tweezers as a sample because I use tweezers daily. These are high quality tweezers that have a nice weight to them and I liked the variety of tips included. The tweezers worked really well and I plan to continue using them. I gave 4 stars only for the quality of the case the tweezers came in. When the package arrived the leather pouch they came in had a strong chemical odor that I did not care for and had to dispose of immediately. However, I am much more concerned with the quality of the tweezers themselves and they are a great product.</li>
            <li> A great set of tweezers that can actually grab fine hair! I have avoided buying a &#x27;nice&#x27; set of tweezers because they are all so expensive. I stick to my drugstore ones and they get most hairs as I try to shape my eyebrows but it takes forever to go back over and sometimes I can see the hair but because it is so new/short, they can&#x27;t grip it and I have to come back to it in a few days. Not anymore, not only is this tweezer set affordable but you get the straight edge, slated edge and pointed ones to cover all your needs. I spend a fraction of the time in front of the mirror because now I have the right tools for the job and they grip really well. I love the case they come in because I can add a few things in there no problem and the case is soft so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my bag. I&#x27;m really glad to know I have these as summer starts as well because I know there will be splinters in our future and now we&#x27;ll actually be able to remove them!</li>
            <li> I just received these tweezers 4 days ago but I have used them no less than 10 times since then! This item was received as part of a deal where I got a coupon for my review, and in my honest opinion these tweezers are better than my very expensive pairs! I easily plucked brows, removed ingrown hairs, removed splinters, and even pulled ticks off of my kiddos after a long camping weekend. The set has 3 pair of tweezers (broad angled, narrow point, and wide flat) that each have their own specific purpose. They also came with a nice black storage pouch to keep them organized and easily found.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a decent tweezer? I had some that were okay, and my husband used them for something or other and they stopped working as well, so it was time to start shopping around. During a promotional period, I discovered this set of three tweezers and decided to give them a try. I am really happy with them! The angled ones have been perfect and make brow maintenance much easier. They grip and remove the hairs easily. I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the very pointy ones, but that could very possibly be user error, and that still leaves the other two working wonderfully. The little pouch they came in is very nice too, no more digging in the drawer looking for the tweezers (and it will hopefully keep my husband from noticing them and using them).</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing! Yes that is my first reaction. I got a coupon for them, ordered them, and literally the day they came in I used the pointy set. My little guy went out to get the package UPS dropped off at the gate and got a splinter. Not knowing what was in the package right away I was looking for a pair of tweezers to get his splinter out. When my daughter opened the package and there they were! I busted out the pointy tweezers a little alcohol and wha la likes Magic the splinter was out. I was impressed with the cute little case they come in. Most of my tweezers get lost cause they are just loosely laying around. Not this set, back in the case every time. The main reason I need tweezers is cause at my youthful older age apparently chin hairs grow. The slanted ones in this set are my favorite unsightly chin hair pullers. All around a great set and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> The day these arrive in the mail was the same day my we found the first tick on our dog. I know, gross! however, whipped out the silver pointed ones and popped that little sucker off! sanitized afterwards. Used the purple ones to refresh the eyebrows and they worked fantastic. I love the little package they come in for travel or just hiding them from family members who always walk off with mine.</li>
            <li> Great set. My brown is rocking!!  I&#x27;m constantly losing tweezers. ALL THE TIME!  The little tote it comes with is so handy. The tweezers are all comfy and easy to use. A wide pinching grip area. Each different one has great attributes. The slanted one is by for my most used. The slant allows for a great grip upon the hair and precise removal. Key to a good looking brow. The pointy ones are great for stray hairs or in my house with kids... Splinter removal.&lt;br /&gt;These are high quality and resonantly priced. I am so glad I was allowed to purchase these with a coupon. I gladly give it a raving review.</li>
            <li> Good value, great customer service.  First set arrived with the pointed set&#x27;s tips misaligned.  After a hassle-free email exchange w grooming district&#x27;s customer service, a new set was promptly sent out.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with very fine eyebrow hairs that can be difficult to see in certain light. Unfortunately, There has been more than one occasion when I have plucked my skin when thinking I was getting a hair. OUCH! I have tried pointed tip and slanted tip tweezers and just can&#x27;t seem to find the best pair for my situation. When I was offered this set as a promotional discount I was excited because it came with all three types of tweezers and a fancy case. These tweezers are amazing! What I found when using this set is a quality set that I have never used before. Now when I pluck the hard to see hairs, I only pluck hairs! What is even better is that, with the slanted tip pair, I am plucking hairs that I was not even aware were there at all. Every single pair of the tweezers in this set are durable and made of a thicker metal that gives them a precision alignment, ensuring that the tips meet every time. I will never buy a different type of tweezer again</li>
            <li> My husband is a magnet for splinters! Prior to this purchase, I had one really nice set of tweezers that I kept in my bathroom. Of course, he doesn&#x27;t get splinters upstairs! So whenever I hear him say &amp;#34;Honey, can you help me get a splinter out?&amp;#34; I have to run up 2 or 3 flights of stairs depending on where he&#x27;s located. So when I was given the opportunity to purchase this set at a reduced price in order to try it out &amp; give my feedback, I was more than happy to do so! These tweezers are nice &amp; heavy duty. They have a good, solid feel to them. The tips all seem to meet up well which is very important! There are 3 different types for a variety of tweezing needs. The pointed one is great for splinter removal! I&#x27;ve had some tweezers that have more of a needle-like point, but these are more than adequate for removing most splinters. The storage case is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> These are excellent tweezers. They arrived in a leather pouch, with a strap to ensure closure. The pouch does not smell too pleasant, however this is not the first leather product I have received to have the same odor, and I imagine it will dissipate after some time. The tweezers are excellent, though. They are professional quality. The tips are sharp enough to ensure a strong hold of even fine hair, and the handles are the perfect width and length for a secure grip, which is my biggest complaint with most tweezers I have tried. I am stoked I was able to receive these tweezers during a promotional period, but I would gladly pay the asking price knowing what I know from using them. I highly recommend these tweezers to people who are familiar with name brands. I would compare these to the same quality as Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  This set of tweezers is all you need to have in your kit!  Except you will want one in your purse, at home, and at work!  The versatility of having three different tweezers for your needs is super duper!  I received this through a promotion and I am so glad as I got rid of all my other tweezers once I received these.  They also come in a nice case so that they are organized and easy to find.  I highly recommend these high quality tweezers with their versatility and usefulness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am impressed with this good quality 3-piece tweezer set.  The golden colored slanted tweezers work perfect for tweezing my eyebrows.  The purple straight tip are very handy for picking up small batteries or eye glasses screws.  The pointed tweezers were the perfect tool to pulling a sliver out of my daughters finger.  The carrying case seems to be a little cheap but the tools are good quality.  The tips when squeezed together come together and line up well.  I have purchased many other tweezers that end up after a few uses no longer able to grip items.  I was lucky enough to purchase this 3-piece set during a promotional period.  I would however consider purchasing this set again for a family member or a friend.  If you are in the market for a well crafted tweezer set stop looking and add these to your cart.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really great! When you grasp something with them, they hold. Spent a lot more $$ on a pair that was good, for the first 3 times used. Then it was like &#x27;air tweezing&#x27; after that. I&#x27;ve used these already 6 times and just as good as the first time. EZ to clean, feel firm in your grasp, strong grip, delivered quickly. What else could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The three tweezers in this set are precision made of quality materials, attractive in appearance and of a size that enhances their use.  The pointed, straight and angled &amp;#34;working ends&amp;#34; are designed for specific grooming applications which greatly widens and customizes their use.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t have a good grip on them.  Apparently I do better with the cheapies from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Three for the price of one! These were definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> really cool tool, pulls really well</li>
            <li> As described, they are uncomfortable to use close to the skin as the tips are completely uncoated.  But they work well.  Only lose one star for the scratchy discomfort of the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last set I bought locally was coated all the way to the tip with the inside still uncoated, so I could press against skin and it didn&#x27;t scratch, but they could still grab very little things very well.  They actually worked better than these without the coating because I could press in without that discomfort I get from these ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they are great :)</li>
            <li> These tweezers do the job! I have about ten pairs of tweezers, partially because some that I&#x27;ve purchased have been junk and partially because my family members can&#x27;t seem to keep track of small items.  One of the things I love most about this tweezers set is that it comes with a carrying pouch.  I purchased this tweezers set during a promotional period in order to do a review. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  Having three different tips to choose from makes all the difference in the world.  I found the purple straight tip and the gold slanted tip the most useful for shaping my eyebrows, and I love that both are colored, so it&#x27;s easy to just grab the right one from the beginning.  (The purple tweezers are my personal favorites. I try those first for everything!)  At first, I thought the silver pointed tip tweezers were pretty useless--they were terrible to use on my eyebrows.  However, a couple of days after I had decided that the silver ones were junk, my husband asked me to help him pull out an ingrown whisker that he couldn&#x27;t see very well.  Well, that&#x27;s when I discovered that the silver tweezers were amazing at getting under the skin to pull out the ingrown hair.  These would also be really helpful with splinters, removing ticks, or other jobs that require precision.  My honest and unbiased opinions are leading me to think that I need to purchase another one of these tweezers sets to keep at work also!</li>
            <li> Keep these with me, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Grooming District Tweezers set complete bundle&lt;br /&gt;This was a great item&lt;br /&gt;the three types of tweezers will assist you in all of your grooming&lt;br /&gt;needs and also I used this to remove a splinter&lt;br /&gt;I found the precise control and defined edges were great&lt;br /&gt;This is a home run and a great gift for any occasion</li>
            <li> Complete set of (3) handy tweezers! The set offers a Slant pair, Straight pair and a Pointed tip pair for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slanted pair of tweezers is great for removing stray eyebrow hairs, or any kind of stray body hair. I use this pair often for my eyebrows so I know it works well! The slant allows me to go in and grab the hair from any angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straight pair of tweezers is flat on top so I find it works better for picking up nail art gems and applying them to wet nail polish. The flat tip of the tweezers lets me place the gem exactly where I want it to be, without jabbing into my wet nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed tip is my favorite pair of tweezers in this set! Nail art tape is a struggle to work with, very thin and hard to place on a nail by just using my fingers. I use the pointed tip tweezers to hold the nail tape securely and place it where I want it to be. Since the pointed tip tweezers are so thin I can easily see exactly what I am doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set overall, perfect for multiple purposes. removing hairs, glass or splinters - awesome tools for a nail design artist! The set comes with a very cool case where I can store the tweezers together and not lose them, which I have done plenty of times with other pairs I&#x27;ve owned. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel mainly for eyebrows and facial hair. Sadly, I am returning them. The slant pair worked ok on eyebrows but not on facial hairs. The pointed one didn&#x27;t work at all and I didn&#x27;t try the blunt one.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect on the go kit.  I have so many little kits to pack when we take trips (every two weeks) so I have everything in a hotel room for the kids that would have at home to fit a button or get a splinter out.  This was the perfect addition to my bag with three different tweezers to use for so many different things.  I like have the option to get a splinter out or pull some unwanted hair with all the different tips especially since they have metal tips that can be cleaned easily but soft cushion handles for holding and gripping.  The case is the perfect size and the bands that came to hold each tweezer close was a great addition. I did get these on a promotion but I would have purchased them for full price because they are great!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a &amp;#34;tweezer snob.&amp;#34;  I have spent more money than I am willing to admit trying to find the perfect set of tweezers.  When I saw the promotion for this set I knew that I needed to try them out!  I have 5 children and always seem to need a pair of tweezers for something.  My 11 year old son tends to get splinters a lot and struggles with sitting still for me to remove the splinter.  If the end of the tweezer is too thick it is almost impossible to remove his splinter.  These tweezers are the perfect thickness to grab the splinter and pull it out!  I didn&#x27;t have to fight with him to sit still or make a little hole in his finger to pull it out.  I literally just grabbed onto the splinter and removed it!  It was awesome!  The pointed end pair are the best for hair removal that I have ever used.  I can grab fine facial hairs and pull them out almost pain free!  I also struggle with ingrown toenails and use tweezers to remove them.  The tweezers must be sharp enough, but not too sharp to cut the tiny piece of nail, in order to remove that part of my toenail.  I finally have tweezers that I can grab and pull my ingrown toenails out!  As gross as that is!  The carrying case is also cute, handy, and practical.  If you have children you must have this set of tweezers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect tweezers but these are OK. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> When I opened this package, I was pleased with the quality of this product for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I like this set, it&#x27;s high quality and very comfortable to use. Tweezers are sharp and versatile, recently used them to take out sharp piece of glass from my foot. This set is the best from what I owned so far. Case is very convenient addition too.</li>
            <li> This little compact set of Tweezers are fantastic. They go right into tour pocket or your purse. There are three different kinds. One with very pointie end, for ingrown hairs. One slanted set for hard to get. And one strait edge for plucking hair or eye brows. This little kit has all that you would need in the Tweezer department. Their cute in their colors. Very fashionable. I received these during a permotion period for my review. I do recomment this set. They aee made of strong material , well made.</li>
            <li> This set of tweezers are not only cute, but they are also functional! I loev that they came in a handy pouch so that I can keep them all together and  in good condition. I was happy to see this product available for review deal. In my unbiased opinion, the product is of great quality. A problem I find with tweezers, often, is that they are not aligned well and end up not catching whatever I am trying to tweeze (like a hair or splinter). This was not an issue in this bundle set. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have attractive accessories!</li>
            <li> These are precisely made high quality tweezers and a pleasure to use.  The leather pouch is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you have a small hair here and there with roots that must go all the way to my toes.  To make it worse, the little critter refuses to be pulled without a lot of perseverance and frustration, and I swear it keeps moving on me.  It usually takes numerous attempts to get ahold of it just right and get it pulled.  The first day I got these tweezers, I used the slanted tip on the little devil.  They gripped it firmly, refused to let it escape and pulled it out painlessly on the first try.  Since then, I tried the pointed tip and it worked just as easily.  What more can you ask for?  There are three different tips in this set.  I haven&#x27;t used the straight tip yet, but I am sure it will work just as well.  They are made of stainless steel, have a nice heavier feel to them, and they are obviously aligned well.  They come with a nice carrying case and rubber ends to protect the tips.  I am very happy with these, and even more so because I got them on sale.  You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this tweezers set!  It domes in a great case so I can keep them together and there is a tweezers for any job I may need them for. These came available for purchase during a promotional period and I was really excited to get these as I am always losing tweezers or don&#x27;t have the right ones I need. I would definitely recommend these for anyone, male or female. They are of a high quality and very easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tweezers set! They are very lightweight, and I love that each one has a different tip, which is perfect for grabbing hard-to-reach hairs. The silver pair will be great for removing splinters (one of the least comfortable tasks ever). The little case is a nice addition, too, and makes it easy to keep all three pairs of tweezers together - I&#x27;ve misplaced plenty of pairs in the past, and I can see that won&#x27;t be an issue for me now. I did purchase these after receiving a promotional code, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve used drugstore tweezers.  You know that ones that cost 1.99?  Yup, those cheap things have been a mainstay at my house. I always thought they worked fine since I didn&#x27;t know any better, but a few years ago, my sister got me a nice pair and I was amazed at what a difference that made. Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve disappeared on me so when I got a chance to order these via promotional code and then give a review, I was stoked. These tweezers are amazing! They&#x27;re even nicer than the big brand name ones I had before. I honestly haven&#x27;t found any downsides to these, so I will just tell you all the features I really like.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel means no allergy problems and great durability.&lt;br /&gt;Different colors means that it is super easy to find the ones you want upon first glance.&lt;br /&gt;Securely packed for shipping which means no blunting on the edges from getting bounced around.&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, they come with a handy case for travel or at home storage which will keep them in pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;The ends were banded or capped which is also great for keeping them in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The variety of styles will fit whatever need comes up, so a single purchase meets all uses.&lt;br /&gt;And of course, and most importantly, they grip every teeny little hair you could possibly want to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also great success with the few splinters that have come our way.</li>
            <li> wow, these are FABULOUS! super preciscion! my brother had a very fine metal sliver, got it out on first try. the tweezers work perfect for my grooming needs. Very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this tweezer pack! They have you covered with straight, slant, and small tip. This kit also comes in a nice leather holder that fits nicely in your purse or suitcase. I especially love the slant tip as that has always been my go to style. I received these tweezers at a reduced rate but they are a bargain at their listed price. The surgical steel is so well honed that each hair I grabbed came out. This is a huge plus as I paid a lot money for other tweezers that didn&#x27;t grasp hairs nearly as well as these!!! I rate them not only a 5 star but a 10 star!!!</li>
            <li> A great set of tweezers!!! I am always grooming my eyebrows- and looking to remove the stray hair and haven&#x27;t been able to find good tweezers. I was so glad to find a multipurpose pack of three. One is perfect for my eyebrows, the other works great to remove the stray hair, and the fine tip would be perfect for splinter removal. All three are very well made, grip easy to make for easy removal, and come with a nice case to keep them all together. I love that they are all a different color. These are the best tweezers that I have owned, and am so glad I received them as a part of a promotion! In edition to personal use, these would be perfect for gifts for family members- especially those with little ones! I plan on including these in our ladies Christmas gift packages!!! They are so durable that I have no doubt they will last for a very long time!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great and convenient set of tweezers.  I have had 1 pair of tweezers for basically forever but now that we have kids (splinters) and my husband works out in the desert, we needed more.  I was excited to be able to grab these during a promotional period!  As soon as they arrived, my husband tried to &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; them to put with his work gear.  He has on occasion used a knife to dig out a cactus spine!  While I didn&#x27;t let him take the whole kit, he loves the fine pointed pair for slivers and cactus.  The slanted pair has replaced my old pair for eyebrows.  They are precise, grab the hair firmly and don&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is great to keep them together and easily accessible.  No more getting lost at the bottom/back of the drawer or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> i mainly wanted the sharp tweezer, which is why i bought the set.  it didn&#x27;t grip anything! i tried using the slanted ones, but i personally prefer the sharp one for eyebrow maintenance; i gave this set away to a family member.</li>
            <li> smell weird and don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c5e9b4733dfbce8a122b83bd1181d59b]]What caught my attention was that this was a set of three. I&#x27;m a firm believer that every household needs tweezers. These are color coded so I am able to grab the one most needed without a second thought.  The Gold Slant Tip is perfect for facial hair; it allows me to get very close to the skin. The purple straight tip I use for precision removal of those tiny fine hairs that seem to fight me all the time. The silver pointed tip we use for first aide and tiny splinter mishaps. They are perfectly aligned for the perfect hair/splinter grip- less time needed to tweeze those unwanted hairs. Major plus. And the 3 tweezers set fits well into the little enclosed pouch which had extra space to allow for scissors or emery boards storage all in one isolated location. Another plus. The ideal would be one for me and one for my first aid kit. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR</li>
            <li> These are sharp, very sturdy and come in a really nice case. Sometimes cheaply made tweezers won&#x27;t pull a single hair out, very frustrating. These will.</li>
            <li> i love this set!  I will be getting another one for my daughter.  so many times you splurge on tweezers only to find the ends are not calibrated when you can finally open the package - frustration...  These 3 do every tweezing job i can  come up with and show no wear.  the nice case keeps them all together.  they don&#x27;t say much about the case but it is really neat with each fitting into it&#x27;s own handy pocket.  Love these.</li>
            <li> These are so competely useless they don&#x27;t even deserve one star.  I mean, they look nice, but who cares?  They don&#x27;t tweeze hair - even my eyebrows, which are the thickest hair I have.  What a complete waste of time.  I tried them because some people, who either got them for free, or have much, much thicker hair than I do, gave them good reviews, but none of the three would work at all.  Pathetic.  Try Tweezerman or even Uncle Bills if you want somethng that works.</li>
            <li> Worst tweezers ive ever had and ive had many</li>
            <li> great! These are great quality and work far better than anything I have been able to find at local stores</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and price.</li>
            <li> One of them is okay, but the other two are shoddy. The pointed one doesn&#x27;t work well for tweezing hairs because the points don&#x27;t touch properly.</li>
            <li> Real nice high quality set well made. Great pricing and fast ship too.I&#x27;m going to get more for holiday gifts Christmas/Hanukkah. Actually work,some tweezers just don&#x27;t do what they are made to do...these work!</li>
            <li> These three piece tweezer that work on different hairs on your brows. For example the pointed tweezers help with ingrown hairs and stubborn hairs. . The tweezers feel comfortable in my hand and I&#x27;m not worried they will slip out my hand while plucking my brows. The pointed tweezers didn&#x27;t work at all because one side was longer than the other.  The tip of the pointed tweezer is sharp so be careful not to stab your self with them. I use the flat tweezers for betweens my two brows to get rid of those hairs that cause a unibrow.  The slant ones help with thick hairs that usually broke off at the base and they helped get the root of the hair out. There are silicone pieces on the tweezers so you don&#x27;t hurt your self. There is a carrying case that is smaller than an iphone 4. The case holds all three of the tweezers securely. I was able to get this set of three tweezers for free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this tweezer set! Arrived in great condition and nice a packaging along with a carrying case to put all the tweezers in. They are all great quality in all areas- sharp ends where they should be, flat ends where it should be, etc. Worked great to pluck eyebrows and I&#x27;m sure will be perfect for any other tweezer need as well! Very happy and satisfied with this product! Like the colors too! :)</li>
            <li> Great quality!  Edges are sharp and grabs on tiny hairs very well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezer set, they all work really well and grab hairs I like that they are different colors and not just boring black, they also come with s move carrying case so they don&#x27;t get lost! Would recommend I received this at discount rate for review</li>
            <li> Not that I doubted that these would be better than my $2 drugstore tweezers, but they far exceeded my expectations.  They are for sure professional quality.  I did my eyebrows as soon as they arrived.  I used both the gold an brown pair.  The hairs came out of the first go around instead of having to try and grab them a couple times. My husband came home from work with a metal splinter in his hand.  I was able to quickly get it out with the pointed silver tweezers. Thanks for letting me try out these tweezers to evaluate, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received my grooming district tweeters set today and started to use them already. This is the best set of tweezers I&#x27;ve bought. They come with 3 different styles to accommodate you for all grooming needs. I like using the slanted one for doing eye lashes. I used the pointed for getting those stubborn hairs on my face that ladies don&#x27;t want nor need. The Grooming District tweeters are stainless steel, no need to worry about rusting or damage. Great for gift ideas and using in a professional setting. They came with a very nice black case that fits them great as seen in pictures. I did receive a promo for my unbiased opinion and that&#x27;s what you have read today.</li>
            <li> Nice to have all three, good quality</li>
            <li> Love this company...I got the personal touch...Had a small concern with the quality of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; of the three tweezers...so I emailed them about an exchange. I received an email back from a nice gentleman from Grooming District named John Branch. His first concern was to make things right. I could tell he was legitimately concerned about the quality of the product he puts out (how often do you see that?). I had a new set and was told I could keep the old set as well. That&#x27;s a great kindness in my book as I didn&#x27;t have to make a trip to the local UPS office to send them back. The second set was perfect :-)&lt;br /&gt;The moral to my story? Buy these tweezers...The price is great, The quality is great (surgical) and if you&#x27;re unhappy for any reason, John is committed to making you happy and he can get things done as I found out later...He&#x27;s a Co-Founder of Grooming District :-)</li>
            <li> This set of tweezers are perfect for so many uses. I found that the tips on all three in the set are super precise. I&#x27;ve found in the past with other tweezers they don&#x27;t close completely across the surface, so you may end up with gaps that allow that stray hair or small splinter to escape. This is not the case at all with these. They get everything! The kids are outside all the time and splinters are quite common in our house. With these tweezers removal is much easier and goes faster - which helps because it reduces the time I need the little ones to hold still! I highly recommend these. The case is nice, too. I can keep them in the bathroom cabinet and not worry about them getting lost. I&#x27;m grateful for the coupon to purchase, but would have bought them either way!</li>
            <li> These came super fast and are really well made! The first thing I checked out was how well the two sides of each tweezer lined up (this will make a huge difference with how well tweezers will remove a hair) and they are perfect matches! I love having every kind of tweezer I may need all in one kit. This came with a little faux suede carrying case. It does have a bit of a plastic smell to it, but you can store it in the freezer for two days and that makes the smell go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great selection and really well made!</li>
            <li> I really like this tweezer set. Not only are the colors great, but they are easy to grip and&lt;br /&gt;comfortable to use. Having the different tips makes getting all of those stubborn little hair&lt;br /&gt;a piece of cake. I was given these free for review and am so happy to have gotten them.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived quickly and were packaged neatly. I will recommend these to my family and&lt;br /&gt;friends.</li>
            <li> Just purchased these Grooming Tweezers (3-Pack) from Amazon.  I needed some tweezers for grooming my puppy. I  bought them because of the different sizes. When grooming their ears, the different size tweezers make it possible to get into smaller areas of the ear. They are very light weight and easy to handle. They have worked out perfect for me as Odie was due his haircut today! Love these tweezers and recommend them highly. Good price...great purchase :)</li>
            <li> I like these tweezers. I tend to keep several pairs of tweezers around the house for touch ups between eyebrow waxing, splinters, and stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets discuss what i DID like about these tweezers....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Stainless steel tips were very sharp and precise.&lt;br /&gt;-The look of the tweezers are very colorful and professional looking&lt;br /&gt;-The variety of tweezers for the price&lt;br /&gt;-The leather carrying pouch and the plastic protectors on the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;-The tweezers feel firm in your hand and does not &#x27;lose shape&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for what i DID NOT like about these tweezers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The tips are a little too thick for my liking making it a little hard to grip my eyebrow hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Because the tweezer tips are a little on the thick side they kept nicking my skin while tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the tweezers i probably won&#x27;t be using them for eyebrow touch ups but they will definitely come in handy for other things</li>
            <li> This is an all in one set of tweezers for sure. There is one for getting ingrown hairs, I have used it for splinter retrieval also. I like the slanted ones for eyebrow grooming the best. They are very well made, and durable. I feel like they will last a good long time. I was able to pick this set up on a promotion, so i was thrilled to try it. Iove that they come in different colors. The pointed pair also come with a plastic sleeve covering them so you do not stab your fingers accidentally when opening the case. These are very well made, and stylish. I would most certainly purchase again for a gift, and I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I was only looking for one tweezer since my older was probably belonged to my mother, in all of its rusted glory. This set seemed nice for the price and the added bonus of a couple more. the one for splinters seems great. I&#x27;ve used the purple one once and it seems adequate I don&#x27;t pluck that much I wax and then find maybe three of four hairs that need to be plucked around my eyebrows. so I am very happy with the purchase and protective pouch.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these with a coupon I recieved! I am constantly misplacing my tweezers. I loved these right away because they come with a case and are also a bright color, which makes it hard to lose. I love how precise they are. I have very light colored hair, which is hard to find the stray eyebrow hairs. These do a great job tracking them down and keeping a hold on them. There is nothing worse than finding a hair, using a tweezers, and them to keep slipping off the hair. These haven&#x27;t done that to me. I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> OMG. Everyone must have these tweezers. I mostly use them for my eyebrows but my son came in with a splinter. I used these needle nose tweezers and got it out immediately. Everyone should have this set. Awesome</li>
            <li> The tweezers do not grip well.  Very disappointed in this purchase and do not recommend the product</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good time. However, tweezers were poor quality. Pointed tweezers were not pointy and sculpting tweezers did not line up. My husband had to reshape and sharpen them before they actually worked.</li>
            <li> The struggle is real when you are looking for a good set of tweezers. I have bought many. I jumped at the chance to buy these and couldn&#x27;t resist after getting a good coupon deal. Had to review. You get 3 in the nice little leather type case. Blunt, sharp, and angled. So far they have all been used here. The sharp for splinter in my forearm, the blunt for a splinter on my daughters hand that had her freaking out, she hates pointy tweezers. I gave her a choice from these 3 and she chose the blunt. They worked perfect! Though I say blunt they really are perfectly sharp just with a horizontal tip. I will keep this set where I can find them this time.</li>
            <li> I purchased a similar set of tweezers for myself about a month ago.  My husband really liked my set so I took advantage of a review promotion to purchase a set for him with the coupon I received. I am saving them to give to him for Father’s Day, nevertheless, I opened them to make sure all was in order and they were the quality that I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The featherweight design set comes with three stainless steel tweezers along with a nice black case for storage.  The set includes one slant, one straight and one pointed tip. The edges meet perfectly, allowing you to grab a single hair or splinter easily and firmly for removal.  I am sure my husband is going to love having his own personal grooming set.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and the tweezers are not cheap-o, but the grip on the angled tweezer is not great. Facial hair slips if I don&#x27;t squeeze fairly tightly. My previous pair (lost by the housekeeper in an unfortunate event) had a texture on the tip which improved the grip on tough or fine hair.</li>
            <li> This tweezer set is a great price, and it seemed to have a lot of good reviews (from people who got them free or at a steep discount--I did not.), so I got them.  I&#x27;ve used them a few times and my thoughts sum up to: they are okay. They seem well made and like they&#x27;ll last.  The tweezer tips seem precisely machined and strong, but for more delicate jobs (pulling out a fine splinter for example) even the most thinly pointed tweezer was too blunted. I imagine they should be fine for most other uses though (pulling out stray hairs, or whatever else).  I kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten something else, simple because my only use for tweezers tends to be for very delicate tasks.</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers hoping they would be great. However, the straight and pointy tip pairs do not work at all! They don&#x27;t pluck one single hair. The slant tip pair works halfway...if you hold them a certain way. Save your money before ordering these and maybe buy a pair from Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  In fact,  such good grip one must be careful not to pinch the skin.  The variety of the product makes them applicable to a variety of challenges.  The carrying case is quite nice.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok - doesn&#x27;t grip as well as other tweezers but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great product and quality. it looks expensive and works well. I love the little leather case that comes with it:)</li>
            <li> These are basically useless. The slanted ones just broke my eyebrow hairs, leaving behind stubs that the needle point couldn&#x27;t get. So now I look like my eyebrows have a 5 o clock shadow. Should have trusted my instincts and repurchased the Revlon tweezers I lost.</li>
