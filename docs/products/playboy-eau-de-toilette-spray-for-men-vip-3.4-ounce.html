            <li>This is my favorite!</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, the smell is nice but the package  was not sealed.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because of all the good reviews and the cheap price.</li>
            <li>By far the best cologne i have ever bought!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I sure do love it on him.</li>
            <li>I love it, and so does my husband.</li>

            <li>Love this scent on my man.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Girls love it</li>
            <li>I so love to smell this on my man</li>
            <li>It is very adeptly balanced and evolves nicely in four tiers and ends as a creamy white chocolate layer cake topped with tarty rhubarb and apples.&lt;br /&gt;Scent:</li>
            <li>the playboy VIP has good smell but don&#x27;t expect a great a bottle, just an average bottle.</li>
            <li>So cheap yet so good!!smells divine</li>
            <li>Smells cheap -</li>
            <li>and specially you are giving somebody as gift</li>
            <li>Not too sweet though</li>
            <li>I bought it together with Pure Discovery by Nautica and Red by Giorgio Berverley Hills which all smells great too and comes with sealed package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great smell, kinda sweet, and reminds me of watermelon a little.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft fragrance for men.  </li>
            <li>Like a fresh shower after a stinky day.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Playboy did right with this scent for men.</li>
            <li>But wow this is seriously the best 8 dollar cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of trying.</li>
            <li>so I tried a few of these Playboy brand cologne since they had good reviews</li>
            <li>i right now have 5 of the playboy sprays and this one is tied for first with the new York spray!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li>It is cheap but lasts long even when he is not wearing his clothes anymore the smell stays on them.</li>
            <li>Vip smells really good comes in a pretty big bottle so thats always good and for less then 10 dollars cant go wrong</li>
            <li>It just vanishes completely after an hour.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells good , really it is VIP ,is very durable skin , the only thing wrong was that the seller sent me in such a small box arrived all beaten, without any protection &#x3D; - / goodness perfume bottle not damaged, and I can enjoy it , would buy again</li>
            <li>Subtle, yet a yummy, sexy scent.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Longevity is very solid for a Playboy at 5-7 hours depending on skin chemistry and this one projects moderately the first hour and a half before settling into a skin scent.</li>

            <li> Very smooth and soft fragrance for men.  This is the one you&#x27;ve been waiting for. Uncommon aromatic smell that transports one into another world.  Worn by the intelligent self-confident man that has arrived.  Transcends all overpowering, harsh, biting fragrances out there.  You won&#x27;t be disapointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells great!! Love it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat price and lots of complement. Party wear ..</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this fragrance and I sure do love it on him. I bought it second time for him. It is cheap but lasts long even when he is not wearing his clothes anymore the smell stays on them. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS FRAGRANCE MYSELF!!</li>
            <li> Longevity is very solid for a Playboy at 5-7 hours depending on skin chemistry and this one projects moderately the first hour and a half before settling into a skin scent. it is an extremely sensual and reliable close quarters scent. . It is very adeptly balanced and evolves nicely in four tiers and ends as a creamy white chocolate layer cake topped with tarty rhubarb and apples.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;Sillage: 5./10&lt;br /&gt;Creativity: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Value: 8/10</li>
            <li> The perfume smells good , really it is VIP ,is very durable skin , the only thing wrong was that the seller sent me in such a small box arrived all beaten, without any protection &#x3D; - / goodness perfume bottle not damaged, and I can enjoy it , would buy again</li>
            <li> SO amazing! i right now have 5 of the playboy sprays and this one is tied for first with the new York spray! would buy again!</li>
            <li> The smell is really good. I love it, and so does my husband. I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing the women&#x27;s scent!</li>
            <li> Vip smells really good comes in a pretty big bottle so thats always good and for less then 10 dollars cant go wrong</li>
            <li> Bought it as a joke gift, not nearly as noxious as I&#x27;d hoped.  I&#x27;m not sure whether to grade it up or down for that.</li>
            <li> he loves it, I .love it. Great smell, kinda sweet, and reminds me of watermelon a little. Not too sweet though just right</li>
            <li> You will smell like a pimp. Whether that&#x27;s good or not is up to you, but I love it!</li>
            <li> The cologne he got me cost $50 though and I couldn&#x27;t keep paying for that once I ran out so I tried a few of these Playboy brand cologne since they had good reviews and I could spare $24 to try 3 different scents. This is my favorite! the others smell great too though. They last about 6 hours and then you can just faintly smell them depending on how many sprays you use. But wow this is seriously the best 8 dollar cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of trying.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this. Playboy did right with this scent for men. Got this for the hubby as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love it, smells great...I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite! So cheap yet so good!!smells divine and it&#x27;s just great just too great. Totally recommend it to all guys it&#x27;s so good!! The box was a little beat up but oh well the bottle was in great condition!!! A MUST HAVE!!!!</li>
            <li> Good smell, girls noticed</li>
            <li> uff this the fragance of the year is cheep but smell so expensive my favorite trade of fragance PLAY BOY .</li>
            <li> This perfume was totally not my style. I ordered it because of all the good reviews and the cheap price. I don&#x27;t like the smell much and it really doesn&#x27;t last long. It just vanishes completely after an hour.</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my man. It&#x27;s not overpowering. Subtle, yet a yummy, sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Too small a size and specially you are giving somebody as gift you feel shy giving something too small. The brand looks great but i had to give something else also with this playboy spray for men.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. It was a gift for me not only is it feminen but it reminds me of what my highschool girlfriend wore.</li>
            <li> Really good. Everyone says it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good cologne and the best deal I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Smells real nice. Like a fresh shower after a stinky day.</li>
            <li> Actual cologne box couldn&#x27;t even stand. The edges are all  worn</li>
            <li> Great quality. Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> By far the best cologne i have ever bought! Girls love it and i would recommend you buy this if you are debating on other cologne</li>
            <li> I so love to smell this on my man it is so intoxicating. he also get complements from other men and women when he wears this.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, the smell is nice but the package  was not sealed. I bought it together with Pure Discovery by Nautica and Red by Giorgio Berverley Hills which all smells great too and comes with sealed package.&lt;br /&gt;So the playboy VIP has good smell but don&#x27;t expect a great a bottle, just an average bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap - so I suppose you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve smelled worse, but you&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere - spend a few extra bucks and grab so David Beckham cologne or Mascolino.</li>
