            <li>it is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>This Matrix Biolage product is doing a great job of both.  </li>
            <li>Matrix&#x27;s volumizing mousse is really good too.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>I still couldn&#x27;t style it or even make it look reasonably nice.  </li>
            <li>NICE FRAGRANCE AND PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a light, fresh, but flowery (that&#x27;s the best I can describe it) smell.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which is often a problem to style.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and find most volumizing shampoos do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it did a great job &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But this shampoo does help my hair feel a bit thicker and more manageable, and I like that.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and makes my hair feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>Next after shampooing twice I use [[ASIN:B00M7VB3QU Beautiful Nutrition Cleaner Longer Rinse Out Conditioner]].</li>
            <li>Then as a final step I use [[ASIN:B00M7VB1IU Beautiful Nutrition Lemon Rinse</li>
            <li>I would not be without it and would recommend it to anyone with fine hair that needs volumizing or bodifying.</li>
            <li>Decent volume and nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the scent, either, though it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it smells great!</li>
            <li>so it feels like you are really getting your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and switched from Garnier Fructis Daily Care (not a volumizing shampoo) to this shampoo hoping to get some more volume, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more products from this line.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that I have found that volumizes my hair to a managable condition...</li>
            <li>Washes out really well.</li>
            <li>CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a flowery scent, but it does not smell too perfumey and it does not bother me with my fragrance sensitivities like many do.</li>
            <li>The secret is first using this volumizing shampoo which had the scent of wild honey produced by exotic bees from fields of rare flowers.</li>
            <li>All I can say in conclusion is that I don&#x27;t want to live without all these products now.</li>
            <li>I have super fine and thin hair and no shampoo is going to change that.  </li>
            <li>After all this I can say hello to soft, sleek, shiny manageable hair.</li>
            <li>A little pricy, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally thin, fine hair, and while I can&#x27;t say that Biolage is a miracle worker that gives me luxurious long thick strong hair...</li>
            <li>Use it all the time on my fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Upon switching to this shampoo, my hair remained unmanageable, but also became frizzy and kinky, no matter how little or how much I styled it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thin, lifeless hair unless I use this product.  It gives my hair volume and bounce and seems to make it stronger and I love the smell</li>
            <li> volumath√©rapie shampoo by Matrix is the only shampoo I have ever used that gives my limp straight hair body and lift.  It even works when I let my hair air dry!</li>
            <li> Wanted to change shampoo.  Sister recommended this product line.  Worked out great.  Will definitely order more products from this line.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and switched from Garnier Fructis Daily Care (not a volumizing shampoo) to this shampoo hoping to get some more volume, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I don&#x27;t really care for the scent, either, though it&#x27;s not terrible. Once I finish off this product I&#x27;ll be trying something else.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and makes my hair feel so clean.  I wish the smell lasted longer.  I didn&#x27;t really feel like it did a great job &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; which is why I took off a star.  But I use this every other day and my hair has never felt healthier.</li>

            <li> I have naturally thin, fine hair, and while I can&#x27;t say that Biolage is a miracle worker that gives me luxurious long thick strong hair... it is a great shampoo. It is gentle on my hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it smells great! I&#x27;ve used Biolage for years and have feel my hair is healthier when I use this product than when I use other brands. I&#x27;ve probably tired several dozen other shampoos, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Gives you loads of volume, but can be a bit drying. If you use during humid weather expect a very thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but worth it.  Foams up while washing so it feels like you are really getting your hair clean.  Decent volume and nice scent.  I&#x27;d buy it again.  Matrix&#x27;s volumizing mousse is really good too.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and scent of this shampoo and the way it produces a lot of lather with just a little product.  Gives my hair body and volume.</li>

All I can say in conclusion is that I don&#x27;t want to live without all these products now. I&#x27;ve been spoilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  My hair had gone lifeless so I tried this shampoo.  It made it lifeless AND weird.  I still couldn&#x27;t style it or even make it look reasonably nice.  Upon switching to this shampoo, my hair remained unmanageable, but also became frizzy and kinky, no matter how little or how much I styled it.  Definitely NOT an improvement.  Even the guy who has cut my hair for 20 years said he couldn&#x27;t do anything with it, and said I should throw the rest of the bottle out. He does not recommend Biolage, saying that the entire line tends to dry out hair.  When I use a different shampoo, my hair immediately improves. I hate to throw stuff away, but think I will actually do it as soon as I receive the next thing I&#x27;m going to try--a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Without it my hair woul be flat as a pancake.</li>
            <li> AT THIS TIME, CANNOT TELL IF SHAMPOO IS WORKING.  NICE FRAGRANCE AND PRODUCT.  HOPE TO KNOW LATER.  CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Cleans terrific.  Washes out really well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hairstylist.  I have very fine hair and find most volumizing shampoos do nothing for me.  They weren&#x27;t even cleaning my hair thoroughly.  This Matrix Biolage product is doing a great job of both.  It has a little bit of a flowery scent, but it does not smell too perfumey and it does not bother me with my fragrance sensitivities like many do. It&#x27;s kind of a light, fresh, but flowery (that&#x27;s the best I can describe it) smell.  Now that I have found it I would not be without it and would recommend it to anyone with fine hair that needs volumizing or bodifying.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time on my fine and thin hair.  Gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that I have found that volumizes my hair to a managable condition...I love it...Thank you</li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
