            <li>and i&#x27;ve burned through a lot of companies  who claim they are the best.</li>
            <li>Gonesh incense has to be the best smelling, longest burning incense I have ever tried.</li>

            <li>Good Good stuff</li>
            <li>Good quality incense.  </li>
            <li>But we just bought a house and it smelled so good</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an issue for me; I think that&#x27;s a fair burn time for the time the smell lingers afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like good incense.</li>
            <li>They are all really strong but they smell very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with these sticks.</li>
            <li>this is probably my favorite in this brand&#x27;s variety!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;OR JUST NICE</li>
            <li>This incense is strong - in a good way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So in the end it&#x27;s almost like I got twice as many sticks.</li>
            <li>:) I love it.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is my favorite incense scent.  </li>
            <li>If you like the sandalwood scent I don&#x27;t believe you can do any better than these.</li>
            <li>However, at the price point, one shouldn&#x27;t except to get better quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li>The is the Perfect scent when used for clearing an environment inside and outside.</li>
            <li>When burning they don&#x27;t smell the best (almost like a incense filled hospital), but after its done burning it smells like sandlewood and the stay is actually quite persistent.</li>
            <li>Love this company and the scent is true sandalwood.</li>
            <li>While they aren&#x27;t the best out there, they certainly do a good job, they&#x27;re cheap, burn for a decent time, and the scent lingers long enough to make the home smell nice.</li>
            <li>&quot; you get with the cheap junk.</li>
            <li>I would light one up when I was done with my cooking.</li>
            <li>We let it burn for a minute or two; it smelled like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and nice, smell stay for a while unlike other kind.</li>
            <li>There is no added scents to make it sweet, light, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of the sandalwood fragrance; it is warm, rich, and fills the entire room with fragrance.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d had a good experience with Cycle brand Sandalum but thought we&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li>Gonesh makes the best incense i have ever spent money on by far.</li>
            <li>And while my favorites are Gonesh #2 and Dragon&#x27;s Blood, this is still right up there and is definitely a go-to, good for everything incense.</li>
            <li>Such a nice smell.</li>
            <li>An old favorite slowing disappearing from retail markets.</li>
            <li>I love the scent she old</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is by far one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I also got their Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense which is far more intense but still true to the scent it should be.</li>
            <li>Just the right blend for a mellow scented environment.</li>
            <li>quick shipping,favorite incense,will purchase again.brings back memories of many years ago when I was much younger.all</li>
            <li>They burn well, smell great, and when finished you hardly see any by-product that it was ever lit.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is my favorite incense and my local store stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>a good 5-10 minutes longer than generic sticks from the local dollar store (as another reviewer mentioned)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burns slowly and really fills up a room with a great smell.</li>
            <li>and it makes the place smell good, instead of its usual pet smell.</li>
            <li>This is strong, so only had to let it burn for 10 mins, then put it out.</li>
            <li>Dragons blood and sandalwood incense are strong and last a while.</li>
            <li>This leads me to conclude that the scent is layered onto a piece of wood, rather than making the stick 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I bought these expecting decent results for their price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>Very calming</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this incense.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite incense and the highest quality fragrance of any commercial incense brand.</li>
            <li>better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It burns much more slowly than the cheap stuff you find at the dollar stores, yet it is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It DID a pretty good job of eliminating stale smells from the living room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are just as advertised and arrived earlier than most other products.</li>
            <li>scents last and is more pleasing than the other dollar brands.</li>
            <li>In the &#x27;70s as a young person I used to burn incense all the time.  </li>
            <li>I would buy from this vendor again in the near future, just NOT this particular scent (sandalwood).</li>
            <li>the price here is too high as i get my locally at a dg and comes to 3 cents a stick.</li>
            <li>I will add that we have a stinky male dog and a stinky old cat</li>
            <li>gave it a four only because my gram said i smells like someone is sick lol</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this and any other product made by them.</li>

            <li> Burns evenly and long lasting scent</li>
            <li> And believe me that was a long, long time ago.</li>
            <li> I mention that because some people want sandalwood mixed with other scents, not just sandalwood.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell. Very calming</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with incense before, but this particular brand and scent made me feel like I had a head cold.</li>
            <li> I burn a lot of incense and i&#x27;ve burned through a lot of companies  who claim they are the best. I&#x27;ve stopped looking, i have found them [[ASIN:B001B60YM6 Sandalwood - Gonesh Stick Incense]].    They burn well, smell great, and when finished you hardly see any by-product that it was ever lit. Good Good stuff</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE SCENT MAKES THE WORLD SMELL LIKE HEAVEN -PERFECT FOR EVENINGS TO RELAX  AND OR MEDITATE&lt;br /&gt;OR JUST NICE ON A BREEZY AFTERNOON</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  Must keep lighting to finish each stick.</li>
            <li> Gonesh incense has to be the best smelling, longest burning incense I have ever tried. It burns much more slowly than the cheap stuff you find at the dollar stores, yet it is relatively inexpensive. I love the scent of the sandalwood fragrance; it is warm, rich, and fills the entire room with fragrance. No funny \\&quot;off-scent\\&quot; you get with the cheap junk. Gonesh sandalwood smells just like a middle eastern bazaar. I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews. This is by far my favorite incense and the highest quality fragrance of any commercial incense brand.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is my favorite incense and my local store stopped carrying it.  This is one of the best smelling sandalwood sticks I have used.</li>
            <li> I buy this at my local supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This incense creates a beautiful scent--that lasts.</li>
            <li> Always an excellent brand!  Burns evenly and long lasting scent</li>
            <li> This is strong, so only had to let it burn for 10 mins, then put it out. At least it will last a long time. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good quality incense.  Love this company and the scent is true sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
            <li> Gonesh makes the best incense i have ever spent money on by far. i highly recommend this and any other product made by them.</li>
            <li> This incense is strong - in a good way. I only need to burn half the stick to get my room smelling the way I want it, and the smell lasts for a while afterward. So in the end it&#x27;s almost like I got twice as many sticks. :) I love it. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I got them from the store for $1.5 each before I search it in Amazon. It&#x27;s strong and nice, smell stay for a while unlike other kind.</li>
            <li> They take about an hour or so to burn. When burning they don&#x27;t smell the best (almost like a incense filled hospital), but after its done burning it smells like sandlewood and the stay is actually quite persistent. I like this smell.</li>
            <li> quick shipping,favorite incense,will purchase again.brings back memories of many years ago when I was much younger.all I need now is a lava lamp.</li>
            <li> In the &#x27;70s as a young person I used to burn incense all the time.  Then I \\&quot;grew up\\&quot; and quit burning it. But we just bought a house and it smelled so good and we realized it was from having had incense burning in it. So we decided to get some. We tried several different ones and I did like them all (#6, nag champa, sandalwood, dragon&#x27;s blood). And while my favorites are Gonesh #2 and Dragon&#x27;s Blood, this is still right up there and is definitely a go-to, good for everything incense. It smells great. I will add that we have a stinky male dog and a stinky old cat and it makes the place smell good, instead of its usual pet smell.</li>
            <li> An old favorite slowing disappearing from retail markets. I used to get it at the local supermarket. Now I&#x27;ll get it at Amazon as &amp;#34;an add-on&amp;#34; with each purchase. Gonesh is American made. I don&#x27;t trust the stuff you see at fairs or is sold on the street.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is my favorite incense scent.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, such as stuff made in small local shops.  That stuff just isn&#x27;t the same.  The Gonesh branded sandalwood smells great, and burns perfectly.  If you like the sandalwood scent I don&#x27;t believe you can do any better than these.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Burn a good 5-10 minutes longer than generic sticks from the local dollar store (as another reviewer mentioned)&lt;br /&gt;-You can smell the sandalwood when burning.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell lasts up to 4 or 5 hours (in a two-story home), with the windows closed in the house, of course.&lt;br /&gt;-As of writing this, the cost for each stick is about 14 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key things to note:&lt;br /&gt;-You can also somewhat smell the actual wood burning underneath the sandalwood scent. This leads me to conclude that the scent is layered onto a piece of wood, rather than making the stick 100% pure. However, at the price point, one shouldn&#x27;t except to get better quality.&lt;br /&gt;-The sticks burn for about 15 minutes. This isn&#x27;t an issue for me; I think that&#x27;s a fair burn time for the time the smell lingers afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is essentially ONLY sandalwood. There is no added scents to make it sweet, light, etc. I mention that because some people want sandalwood mixed with other scents, not just sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with these sticks. While they aren&#x27;t the best out there, they certainly do a good job, they&#x27;re cheap, burn for a decent time, and the scent lingers long enough to make the home smell nice. I bought these expecting decent results for their price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> They are all really strong but they smell very good. And another plus is  they help me with my headaches and migraines.</li>
            <li> gave it a four only because my gram said i smells like someone is sick lol&lt;br /&gt;but I love the scent she old so whatever ahah</li>
            <li> I rated 3 starts because it lasted longer compared to other brands I&#x27;ve bought at convenience stores. The fragrance,when lighted was too charcoal-y. I would light one up when I was done with my cooking. It DID a pretty good job of eliminating stale smells from the living room.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was faster than what I expected. I would buy from this vendor again in the near future, just NOT this particular scent (sandalwood). A bit disappointed as these scents were made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> Best Sandalwood I&#x27;ve come across. Burns slowly and really fills up a room with a great smell. I&#x27;m adding it to my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> They are just as advertised and arrived earlier than most other products. Dragons blood and sandalwood incense are strong and last a while.</li>
            <li> this is probably my favorite in this brand&#x27;s variety!</li>
            <li> I like good incense. I hate perfume. We&#x27;d had a good experience with Cycle brand Sandalum but thought we&#x27;d try something different. I lit this up. We let it burn for a minute or two; it smelled like cheap perfume. My wife looked at me. I looked at my wife.  We snuffed it out. We&#x27;d never snuffed out incense before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent of incense since I was a teenager. And believe me that was a long, long time ago. The sandalwood fragrance of this brand hasn&#x27;t changed in all those years. It takes me back.</li>
            <li> This fragrance ranks up there with the Lavender.  Genesh makes the best incense that burns well and has an aroma that can&#x27;t be beat.  The after affects are wonderful too.  It lingers with a mellow aroma in the room.</li>
            <li> better than other brands. the price here is too high as i get my locally at a dg and comes to 3 cents a stick. scents last and is more pleasing than the other dollar brands.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is by far one of my favorite scents. The Gonesh Sandalwood is a very good quality incense and I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money. It doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this incense. It is not too overpowering as some incense can be. Just the right blend for a mellow scented environment. I also got their Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense which is far more intense but still true to the scent it should be.</li>
            <li> The is the Perfect scent when used for clearing an environment inside and outside. The nature of elements Do listen!</li>
