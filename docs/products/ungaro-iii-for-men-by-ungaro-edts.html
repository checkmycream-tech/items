            <li>No gothic rose, no vodka, just rubbing alcohol, sage, and cedar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that \\&quot;Ungaro III\\&quot; was a rose scent for men, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like rose to</li>
            <li>description says it contains \\&quot;cirtus, lavender, rose, woods, and spicy</li>
            <li>; Well, it&#x27;s a nice dream; it&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Now you can earn her hatred all on your own.</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance, very masculine.</li>
            <li>I will gladly buy more of this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve owned hundreds of the top name colognes.</li>
            <li>The spicy note comes out to me more than anything else.  </li>
            <li>It has a more formal sent that seems suited cooler weather.</li>
            <li>Love the product, price and service.  </li>
            <li>I had just applied, immediately began peeling off her clothes and we remained locked in the embrace of love all night</li>
            <li>- what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon,</li>
            <li>The most heavenly frangrance.  </li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>Got so many complements on my night out.</li>
            <li>really glad to have made this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the most under rated perfumes out there in the market.</li>
            <li>You will be glad that you did.</li>
            <li>If you want a cologne that a more sophisticated woman is attracted to, then this one is for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone seems to love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The price was great, it lasts all day long, and my husband smells AMAZING when he wears it.  </li>
            <li>It is however, very manly and probably good for evening wear.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, not too strong and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The best have been looking for it a long time!!!!!</li>
            <li>this is one of the best and is a little known brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U3 opens with a blast of cheap pungent alcohol; not \\&quot;vodka\\&quot; but rather cheap rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent from this cologne.</li>
            <li>simply put an extraordinary fragrance that is very classy perfect for that special date or wedding,if you want to make an impression on a special occasion this is it you won&#x27;t smell like anybody else for shure, definitely in my top 5 of alltime greats</li>
            <li>Unique scent that lasts all day and night.  </li>
            <li>no one I know uses it so it remains a unique scent.</li>
            <li>its a unique smell of spice and musk not too  sweet.</li>
            <li>Masculine rose smell.</li>
            <li>Today, men&#x27;s cologne is more flighty and kind of bubbles around, lots of acqua like smell, here today gone tomorrow, no real distinct character.</li>
            <li>it is so masculine and smells so good that i probably use too much at times.  </li>
            <li>This was a gamble for me, I was in the market for some different fragrances, I look up some recommended ones and this was surprising on the top of the list, despite being over 20 years old!</li>
            <li>I love the smell; I just wish the bottle allowed for dabbing because the smell can be a bit strong when sprayed, but that&#x27;s a general problem in the perfume bottling industry.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a dark, sexy, and fresh scent which I like to use just about any kind of time in the day.</li>
            <li>Lavender and sage transitioning into cedar and sandalwood is done all too frequently in men&#x27;s perfume, and none of the exotic tones raved about on Basenotes etc.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>The heart notes are most similar, and as stated, I don&#x27;t like either, but if you like DGPH and don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it, U3 may be a cheaper alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased it for an old friend because he prefers perfumes that are strong, and I hope he likes it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The modern day cologne that is distinct is a put off on my skin and chokes me.</li>
            <li>Its ok i personally would not buy it again,it will probally be on my dresser for years since i dont find myself using it often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big perfume collector and have the likes of amouage, tom ford, andy tauer (LDDM), Serge Lutens (Chergui), and many more, but, I still keep coming back for Ungaro iii and that says a lot.</li>
            <li>Got compliments from women the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li>whatever more interesting original has been cited on the internet, but what&#x27;s left will be of little interest to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, but not like the more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the positive reviews I read on Amazon match this scent.</li>
            <li>It projects like a lighthouse for 6-8 hours (which can be a good or bad thing) and offers a richer drydown (some tobacco and tonka bean in there) and better top notes (citrus notes rather than isopropyl).</li>
            <li>i really love this product and what  i got was exactly what i saw and expected.</li>
            <li>This is a bit different than what I am used to, which is usually a light fruity sent.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how much longer it will be on the market.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t the real cologne kinda like after shave</li>
            <li>The seller got it to us really fast, too.  </li>
            <li>Even though I am not a guy, I really appreciate the smell of this EDT Spray.</li>
            <li>Besides this, the internet fragrance community is full of reviews about the \\&quot;unique vodka note\\&quot; and \\&quot;dark Gothic rose\\&quot; to be smelled here, etc.</li>
            <li>if you apply it directly especially like you would other pefumes/colognes, it&#x27;ll be too strong and will be strong all day.</li>
            <li>it is highly recommended for those who are connossieurs of perfumes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If your a young male adult looking for something different and nice, this is it.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend you try just a bit and see how you like</li>
            <li>though about twice the price of U3 has a little bit more to offer.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the woodsy/smoky scent and he likes the fact that when he wears it, he can hear women behind him talking about how good he smells.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying any product easily faked, watered down, or otherwise high quality item in person or directly from the producers website.</li>
            <li>Back then colognes had a distinct professional mans smell.</li>
            <li>very masculine, not a woman&#x27;s scent in a man cologne bottle.</li>
            <li>Very masculine.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It leaves quite the impression on the ladies - wondering if they can cosy up to you for just that much more time than usually allowed...</li>
            <li>I like this smell, can be loud on the onset spray (but does not choke me) but the melt down is the good, last a long time and remains gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Ungaro lii on and off for quite a while, and I always get complimented by the ladies on my eclectic choice.&lt;br /&gt;Great for evenings and also for daytime, with an incredibly refreshing woodsy smell mixed with a slight tint of musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to get something decent for this same price range, Grey Flannel, Havana, Aramis 900 etc all give you far more complex and pleasant smells for the same price or less.</li>

            <li>smell really short ,the bottle is beautiful but the fragrance disappointed, I expected better</li>
            <li>It gives the smell of a matured and grown young man.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>When the current bottle is empty I will weigh it, then the full bottle and record the numbers.</li>
            <li>Is a very soft and lasting fragrance, compared to some</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very weak sillage and I cannot detect any Rose smell at all.</li>
            <li>I fixed the latter by scratching an arrow.</li>
            <li>It smells even better after 15-20min and it lasts hours (this is the sillage, two L&#x27;s, pronounced &#x27;see-yazh&#x27;; not to be confused with fermented corn silage which has one L!).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>, not sure how U3 used to smell, but it is a waste of money these days, except possibly for cheapskate fans of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme, who will find a fairly inexpensive echo of the more expensive fragrance here.</li>
            <li>The dry down is also similar in that both have sandalwood and cedar notes featured prominently, but unfortunately for both U3 &amp; DGPH, it&#x27;s the rather cheap synthetic cedar tone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain the bottle I received was watered down.</li>
            <li>The missing fifth star is for the bottle, which is too opaque to judge how much is left and for the spray aperture which rotates so freely that it is easy to wrongly aim.</li>
            <li>I barely spray it on me and its there when i get back from work.</li>

            <li> I have been using Ungaro lii on and off for quite a while, and I always get complimented by the ladies on my eclectic choice.&lt;br /&gt;Great for evenings and also for daytime, with an incredibly refreshing woodsy smell mixed with a slight tint of musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to get something decent for this same price range, Grey Flannel, Havana, Aramis 900 etc all give you far more complex and pleasant smells for the same price or less.</li>

            <li> smell really short ,the bottle is beautiful but the fragrance disappointed, I expected better</li>
            <li> It gives the smell of a matured and grown young man.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> When the current bottle is empty I will weigh it, then the full bottle and record the numbers.</li>
            <li> Is a very soft and lasting fragrance, compared to some</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very weak sillage and I cannot detect any Rose smell at all.</li>
            <li> I fixed the latter by scratching an arrow.</li>
            <li> It smells even better after 15-20min and it lasts hours (this is the sillage, two L&#x27;s, pronounced &#x27;see-yazh&#x27;; not to be confused with fermented corn silage which has one L!).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> , not sure how U3 used to smell, but it is a waste of money these days, except possibly for cheapskate fans of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme, who will find a fairly inexpensive echo of the more expensive fragrance here.</li>
            <li> The dry down is also similar in that both have sandalwood and cedar notes featured prominently, but unfortunately for both U3 &amp; DGPH, it&#x27;s the rather cheap synthetic cedar tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain the bottle I received was watered down.</li>
            <li> The missing fifth star is for the bottle, which is too opaque to judge how much is left and for the spray aperture which rotates so freely that it is easy to wrongly aim.</li>
            <li> I barely spray it on me and its there when i get back from work.</li>
            <li> I use it during casual outings and at work (I work night shift) because the scent is not too overwhelming and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected, it smells like cheap 5 dollar perfume, dont waste your money on this one, its not worth it...</li>
            <li> and then it becomes a flat smell.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the fragrance loses its projection quickly and becomes a skin scent in well less than 4</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments EVERY single day.  </li>
            <li> This cologne makes me wonder why all my other ones don&#x27;t stay as long.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Use this but be careful from the ladies onslaught.</li>
            <li> you are blind buying this one, go right ahead.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint.</li>

            <li> Ungaro should pull the plug on this dull disappointment, but apparently a few fish are still biting, in search of complexity and subtlety that no longer exist in this iteration of the product.ated, I don&#x27;t like either, but if you like DGPH and don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it, U3 may be a cheaper alternative.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ungaro III was designed by two heavy hitting perfume designers in the mid-point of their career. Besides this, the internet fragrance community is full of reviews about the \\&quot;unique vodka note\\&quot; and \\&quot;dark Gothic rose\\&quot; to be smelled here, etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not sure how U3 used to smell, but it is a waste of money these days, except possibly for cheapskate fans of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme, who will find a fairly inexpensive echo of the more expensive fragrance here. Unfortunately D&amp;G PH does nothing for me, so U3 is not even of use to me even as a clone.  I&#x27;m not sure how or when this was reformulated from whatever more interesting original has been cited on the internet, but what&#x27;s left will be of little interest to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U3 opens with a blast of cheap pungent alcohol; not \\&quot;vodka\\&quot; but rather cheap rubbing alcohol. This lasts for a few unpleasant minutes and then settles into the heart notes of lavender, sage, and geranium. The lavender and sage are emphasized, which is where the DGPH resemblance comes in. The dry down is also similar in that both have sandalwood and cedar notes featured prominently, but unfortunately for both U3 &amp; DGPH, it&#x27;s the rather cheap synthetic cedar tone which permeates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose, vetiver, musk, and lily of the valley exist only in the scent pyramid text of U3, not anywhere olfactorially  in the fragrance. Lavender and sage transitioning into cedar and sandalwood is done all too frequently in men&#x27;s perfume, and none of the exotic tones raved about on Basenotes etc. is to be found here. Moreover, the fragrance loses its projection quickly and becomes a skin scent in well less than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DGPH though about twice the price of U3 has a little bit more to offer. It projects like a lighthouse for 6-8 hours (which can be a good or bad thing) and offers a richer drydown (some tobacco and tonka bean in there) and better top notes (citrus notes rather than isopropyl). The heart notes are most similar, and as stated, I don&#x27;t like either, but if you like DGPH and don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it, U3 may be a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of the market, move along, there&#x27;s nothing to see here. If you want to get something decent for this same price range, Grey Flannel, Havana, Aramis 900 etc all give you far more complex and pleasant smells for the same price or less. No gothic rose, no vodka, just rubbing alcohol, sage, and cedar. Ungaro should pull the plug on this dull disappointment, but apparently a few fish are still biting, in search of complexity and subtlety that no longer exist in this iteration of the product.ated, I don&#x27;t like either, but if you like DGPH and don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it, U3 may be a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of the market, move along, there&#x27;s nothing to see here.

            <li> I bought two of these for my freinds&#x27; BD and both of them loved it! i do like the smell too and for this price it&#x27;s a wonderful Cologne!</li>
            <li> simply put an extraordinary fragrance that is very classy perfect for that special date or wedding,if you want to make an impression on a special occasion this is it you won&#x27;t smell like anybody else for shure, definitely in my top 5 of alltime greats and I&#x27;ve owned hundreds of the top name colognes. i promise you won&#x27;t regret buying this master piece!!!!! age range 25 to 50</li>
            <li> i used this perfume about 10 years ago and looked for till i saw it at amazon. i really love this product and what  i got was exactly what i saw and expected. it is highly recommended for those who are connossieurs of perfumes.</li>
            <li> good product and excellent fragance</li>
            <li> The best have been looking for it a long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I&#x27;ve read that \\&quot;Ungaro III\\&quot; was a rose scent for men, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like rose to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description says it contains \\&quot;cirtus, lavender, rose, woods, and spicy notes\\&quot;. I smell citrus and lavender, but no rose at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just not a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is a bit different than what I am used to, which is usually a light fruity sent.  The spicy note comes out to me more than anything else.  It has a more formal sent that seems suited cooler weather.</li>
            <li> Reliable seller, excellent product, recommended 100% the exquisite scent stays all day,the exquisite scent stays all day, is a soft and elegant fragrance I wear with pride.</li>
            <li> a hidden gem!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Is a very soft and lasting fragrance, compared to some this is one of the best and is a little known brand.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price and service.  My wife loves it, too.  Unique scent that lasts all day and night.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR one of my favorite scents. I constantly get comments and even inquiries like \\&quot;what are you wearing? THAT cologne smells AWESOME!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s also a good bang for the buck! I wear it almost everyday and I am on my second bottle in over a year.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;She took one whiff on the Ungaro Iii I had just applied, immediately began peeling off her clothes and we remained locked in the embrace of love all night long.&amp;#34; Well, it&#x27;s a nice dream; it&#x27;s a nice scent. Women comment favorably and I like it - what more is there to say? The missing fifth star is for the bottle, which is too opaque to judge how much is left and for the spray aperture which rotates so freely that it is easy to wrongly aim. I fixed the latter by scratching an arrow. The opacity? When the current bottle is empty I will weigh it, then the full bottle and record the numbers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I just wanted</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected, it smells like cheap 5 dollar perfume, dont waste your money on this one, its not worth it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my father in-law. It smells great. My mother in-law is just greatful hehe. Excellent. Recomendado.</li>
            <li> Masculine rose smell. Don&#x27;t ask me how these two go well. But it does. Wish it lasted longer. Less than an hour longevity. I like it for the time is stays on me.</li>
            <li> Love Ungaro III ! Will be ordering more soon,</li>
            <li> smell really short ,the bottle is beautiful but the fragrance disappointed, I expected better</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments EVERY single day.  Not a day goes by that someone does not ask me &amp;#34;what is that you are wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was a gamble for me, I was in the market for some different fragrances, I look up some recommended ones and this was surprising on the top of the list, despite being over 20 years old! So I decided why not and give it a shot. Wow! this blew me by surprise. The smell is like dark roses with a little of something I couldn&#x27;t figure out. It gives the smell of a matured and grown young man. This is definitely an attention grabber and I jump at it again. If your a young male adult looking for something different and nice, this is it.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of cologne I used in the 80&#x27;s. Back then colognes had a distinct professional mans smell. Today, men&#x27;s cologne is more flighty and kind of bubbles around, lots of acqua like smell, here today gone tomorrow, no real distinct character. The modern day cologne that is distinct is a put off on my skin and chokes me. I like this smell, can be loud on the onset spray (but does not choke me) but the melt down is the good, last a long time and remains gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise get a smaller bottle, it can get boring quite quickly and then it becomes a flat smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a good one. I read it in someone&#x27;s blog and bought it. Would recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> this cologne has become one of my favorites.  it is so masculine and smells so good that i probably use too much at times.  try this one and you will know what i mean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time and this was a great value plus free shipping. Don&#x27;t know how much longer it will be on the market.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t the real cologne kinda like after shave</li>
            <li> This perfume has a dark, sexy, and fresh scent which I like to use just about any kind of time in the day. I use it during casual outings and at work (I work night shift) because the scent is not too overwhelming and it lasts for hours. Moreover it doesn&#x27;t take a lot out of your wallet and adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> I quistion if this is not a copy seems less fragrant</li>
            <li> The most heavenly frangrance.  I follow my man around enjoying his wonderful aroma when he wears Ungaro.  It makes you want to get close to him.</li>
            <li> The price was great, it lasts all day long, and my husband smells AMAZING when he wears it.  It&#x27;s all I can do not to follow him around all day, sniffing.  My husband loves the woodsy/smoky scent and he likes the fact that when he wears it, he can hear women behind him talking about how good he smells.  I will gladly buy more of this stuff!  The seller got it to us really fast, too.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, very masculine. Recommended it to friends who ordered the sam. They love it too. The price is also fair.</li>
            <li> I used it when I was 15. And have been looking for it since. My wife simply loves the fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Good for the club. Got so many complements on my night out. especially from the ladies. Use this but be careful from the ladies onslaught.</li>
            <li> awesome scent-many compliments-no one I know uses it so it remains a unique scent. Wish it wasn&#x27;t a spray on though</li>
            <li> Frankly, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from it, I bought based on the reviews! I am pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Even though I am not a guy, I really appreciate the smell of this EDT Spray. It is not light at all but a little heavy and spicy. It is however, very manly and probably good for evening wear. I have purchased it for an old friend because he prefers perfumes that are strong, and I hope he likes it.</li>
            <li> Scent-sual attraction is a heck of a good reason to get this! It leaves quite the impression on the ladies - wondering if they can cosy up to you for just that much more time than usually allowed...</li>
            <li> I love the smell; I just wish the bottle allowed for dabbing because the smell can be a bit strong when sprayed, but that&#x27;s a general problem in the perfume bottling industry.</li>
            <li> Great smell... ladies notices and compliment the smell everytime I wear it. really glad to have made this purchase. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent from this cologne. its a unique smell of spice and musk not too  sweet. women I find are not too fond of this scent but it does smell like a mans cologne. a mans man would wear this. very masculine, not a woman&#x27;s scent in a man cologne bottle.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and just buy a pine tree car air freshener and rub it on yourself. It&#x27;ll smell the same.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but not like the more expensive ones out there. The price i and reviews is what got me to buy it.</li>
            <li> Its ok i personally would not buy it again,it will probally be on my dresser for years since i dont find myself using it often.</li>
            <li> WOW. This cologne makes me wonder why all my other ones don&#x27;t stay as long. I barely spray it on me and its there when i get back from work. if you apply it directly especially like you would other pefumes/colognes, it&#x27;ll be too strong and will be strong all day. so i highly recommend you try just a bit and see how you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t believe am saying this but 100% SATISFACTION.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, not too strong and it lasts all day.  It&#x27;s growing on my wife as well.  I will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain the bottle I received was watered down. I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and have been looking for another since. It&#x27;s been awhile but I remember the smell lasting DAYS on clothing. The scent from this bottle is gone within 20 minutes. I would recommend buying any product easily faked, watered down, or otherwise high quality item in person or directly from the producers website.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very weak sillage and I cannot detect any Rose smell at all. I don&#x27;t think the positive reviews I read on Amazon match this scent.</li>
            <li> An absolutely amazing perfume. I&#x27;m a big perfume collector and have the likes of amouage, tom ford, andy tauer (LDDM), Serge Lutens (Chergui), and many more, but, I still keep coming back for Ungaro iii and that says a lot. I&#x27;m currently using my 4th bottle. This is probably one of the most under rated perfumes out there in the market. I would have bought this even if it was 3 or 4 times the current price.&lt;br /&gt;If you are blind buying this one, go right ahead. You will be glad that you did.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times, but have gotten compliments each time. Very happy with this purchase. If you want a cologne that a more sophisticated woman is attracted to, then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do it for me; I rolled the dice on this one and crapped out. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin in terms of smell, it&#x27;s a little stronger to me.</li>
            <li> Very masculine. I have been using Ungaro lii on and off for quite a while, and I always get complimented by the ladies on my eclectic choice.&lt;br /&gt;Great for evenings and also for daytime, with an incredibly refreshing woodsy smell mixed with a slight tint of musk.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone seems to love it. Awesome choice.</li>
            <li> Got compliments from women the first day I wore it. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> You can google the reviews for the fragrance but I can confirm the reviews match the smell. It smells even better after 15-20min and it lasts hours (this is the sillage, two L&#x27;s, pronounced &#x27;see-yazh&#x27;; not to be confused with fermented corn silage which has one L!).&lt;br /&gt;  You will not regret buying it, people will comment on how great you smell often. As a bonus, few other men will be wearing this cologne so you have less of a chance of smelling like her ex whom she hates and reviles. Now you can earn her hatred all on your own. Enjoy!</li>
