            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived on time (this came from Thailand), but it arrived as expected and although I cannot say I notice a difference yet, I really love Lactacyd products, they smell great, keep the PH levels balanced, so I&#x27;m fresh all day, so I love this product and all Lactacyd.</li>
            <li>and she said it was amazing, with just the first use.  </li>
            <li>Feels fresh each use!</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as to what its advwrtised for and even better.</li>
            <li>smells great and makes me really soft but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; really</li>
            <li>It will lightly clean, purify and whiten your skin in that area.</li>
            <li>it works, clears up right away!</li>
            <li>It has good result as expected.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more on a later date</li>

            <li>really awsome</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t lighten, I wanted just have as an intimate wash.</li>
            <li>I was always embarrassed about that private area being darker than normal and this worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>When I first read about this product, &amp;#34; I thought, right, Germany could scoop the US in making such a product and scooping us in researching the need for this product.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>No other intimate wash I&#x27;ve ever used has worked so WELL!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try something new.</li>

            <li>I dont roughly handle my vagina nor do I pump up my vagina full of soap.</li>
            <li>It seems that my vag is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is ok but you will results slowly.</li>

            <li> I purchased Lactacyd White Intimate Whitening Daily Feminine Wash &amp; XR Brands Anal Bleach with Vitamin C and Aloe.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> I have dark nipples, arm pits and vaginal/ anal areas due to hormonal changes from early onset menopause...</li>
            <li> The wash only once a day and the bleach twice a day (except for a few times when I forgot before going to bed).</li>
            <li> I was always curious about anal bleaching, but this is a rip off.  </li>
            <li> When I thought about it, it was no real surprise to me.  </li>
            <li> I took a gander at the area I&#x27;m treating the other day</li>
            <li> It actually works but you have to use it twice a day for at least 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work for you.</li>
            <li> The trick is, when I apply this, I lather and leave in place for approximately 5 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Wtf!</li>
            <li> After a week of using this, I noticed an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> After seeing some bad reviews I almost didn&#x27;t buy it, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> Gave me a yeast infection :-(</li>

            <li> I much prefer Summer Eves products. After a week of using this, I noticed an unpleasant smell. It didn&#x27;t help with any whitening.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh each use!</li>
            <li> I purchased Lactacyd White Intimate Whitening Daily Feminine Wash &amp; XR Brands Anal Bleach with Vitamin C and Aloe. I started using both at the same time. The wash only once a day and the bleach twice a day (except for a few times when I forgot before going to bed). I&#x27;ve been on this routine for 6 weeks. I took a gander at the area I&#x27;m treating the other day and I have to say, it seems to be working! I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time but it seems to be working. It smells good too anda small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have still use this product and find no skin ligntening effect.&lt;br /&gt;Did not get what was advertised, but problem was handled in a timely manne</li>
            <li> It is ok but you will results slowly.</li>
            <li> After seeing some bad reviews I almost didn&#x27;t buy it, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I&#x27;m glad I did! It actually works but you have to use it twice a day for at least 4 weeks. I&#x27;ll be buying a larger size.</li>
            <li> smells great and makes me really soft but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; really</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Will be purchasing more on a later date</li>
            <li> it is very good. the item was made in Thailand, that&#x27;s why I leave 3 star at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;However, the item is good, so I change the feedback.</li>
            <li> it works, clears up right away! i can see the difference after applying it.. perfect for shaving :)</li>
            <li> i think its working only been using for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I was always curious about anal bleaching, but this is a rip off.  I&#x27;m fair skinned but it does smell good but so does Dove soap.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time (this came from Thailand), but it arrived as expected and although I cannot say I notice a difference yet, I really love Lactacyd products, they smell great, keep the PH levels balanced, so I&#x27;m fresh all day, so I love this product and all Lactacyd.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet. I think is too soon but I&#x27;ll finish the product and keep you posted!!! Just an update, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks of using it and still don&#x27;t see any improvement. I&#x27;ll try something new.</li>
            <li> Gave me a yeast infection :-(</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. It will lightly clean, purify and whiten your skin in that area. No other intimate wash I&#x27;ve ever used has worked so WELL!</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as to what its advwrtised for and even better. I was always embarrassed about that private area being darker than normal and this worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> This product definitely does what it says it does! Ive been using for maybe 2 weeks if even and I can visably see the difference. The freshness is a plus, definitely recommend. Im 100% hispanic</li>
            <li> i like it,it is really good&lt;br /&gt;my friend likes it too&lt;br /&gt;after use it,my private place become white&lt;br /&gt;its really awsome</li>
            <li> It has good result as expected. I am using it twice a day and results are really good as promised.</li>
            <li> When I first read about this product, &amp;#34; I thought, right, Germany could scoop the US in making such a product and scooping us in researching the need for this product.&amp;#34;  When I thought about it, it was no real surprise to me.  Wife tried it and she said it was amazing, with just the first use.  She says it is the best thing I ever bought her.</li>
            <li> I dont roughly handle my vagina nor do I pump up my vagina full of soap. I ONLY used this stuff to cleanse the vaginal folds. So imagine my surprise whe. I started itching like a mother 30 min later. Wtf! Even if it didn&#x27;t lighten, I wanted just have as an intimate wash. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work for you. It seems that my vag is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> can you provide me the FDA of this product</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 4-5 days and I see a lot of improvement!  I have dark nipples, arm pits and vaginal/ anal areas due to hormonal changes from early onset menopause...so far I see significant change. The trick is, when I apply this, I lather and leave in place for approximately 5 minutes before rinsing. I use it every shower/bath /day and it has a pleasant smell. I have issues with a lot of scents...this one is a must have for anyone who wants or requires a pretty dairy aire  ; -)</li>
