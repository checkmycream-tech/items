            <li>I will continue to order my favorite Kerastase products from this company.</li>
            <li>It seemed more like sunscreen than a hair product.  </li>
            <li>Great results with the real product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Also it smells good and does not require that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does have a grapefruit smell like the shampoo, but not as strong.</li>
            <li>I think that this particular variety is not as good as others.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it makes my hair shinier, but it drys it out</li>
            <li>This conditioner is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of hydrating, especially if you have processed hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy this frequently because of the cost and honestly think the manufacturer could do MUCH better on the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Unbelievable excellent results.  </li>
            <li>While the service, packaging, delivery and seller are all impeccable, the product is no longer the same.  </li>
            <li>No smells (as I am highly sensitive to smells) and the thickness of the product goes on nicely and feels cleansing on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, highlighted, hair and this was perfect for detangling and offering just enough conditioning without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does a better job making my fuzzy hair soft and shiny than any conditioner I ever tried before.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.   </li>
            <li>The old formula was MILES better.</li>
            <li>Instead I was told the stuff from the salon was probably out dated, ya right.</li>
            <li>used if for month, and it just didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products from drugstore to professional brands but have not seen much</li>
            <li>company shipped it super fast too.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a great fragrance and works very well, Does not leave hair limp.</li>
            <li>I ordered at a significant discount than what I normally pay at salons or through the companies website.</li>
            <li>It made my hair much more smooth than any other conditioner I could have used.</li>
            <li>This product actually does make my one-process-bleach hair look much better.</li>
            <li>Since I am not blessed with a massive amount of hair, I was able to get away with using about a quarter-sized amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, concentrating the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on the ends.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this conditioner many times from the salon I go to and the one I ordered on Amazon was not the same.</li>
            <li>This was a good price which is so much more expensive at the salon.</li>
            <li>Very strong odor and EXTREMELY RUNNY.</li>
            <li>and I certainly &amp;#34;ration&amp;#34; it when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and my stylist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li>Brushing my hair after getting out of the shower used to be an ordeal because it would tangle so much.</li>
            <li>Once it is rinsed out I really can&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found myself trying to massage and spread it evenly without using too much but it still went out much faster than my shampoo.</li>
            <li>The difference was IMMEDIATE and very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to decode the different &amp;#34;erosion levels&amp;#34; on the front of these bottles and even the Kerastase website does not seem to list all of the products that are available, so it&#x27;s not all that straighforward.</li>
            <li>Very so-so.</li>
            <li>I use it on alternate days as a light conditioner, alternating with a Biologue/Matrix product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this was NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li>It really helps with damaged hair.</li>
            <li>and I need to use conditioner, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay as much for it again.  </li>
            <li>The pink line is my favorite</li>
            <li>Now, it really over coats</li>
            <li>This product really helped repair my hair after a color-correction.</li>
            <li>Kerastase&#x27;s Ciment Anti-Usure is a nice alternative to using heavy conditioners every day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Biolage Fort.</li>
            <li>Great product to use on highlighted hair that is dry and dull from processing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my new hairstylist recommended this shampoo/conditioner, I hesitantly ($$$!!!) decided to give it a shot out of sheer desperation.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a modest size container and the price is high.</li>
            <li>It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>After using it all i missed the subtlety of the of the soft scent.</li>
            <li>Hair textures are different from person to person and this one for my hair really did nothing.  </li>
            <li>, I came home applied the heat cream, the balm and used the iron, it was instantly soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked really well in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn&#x27;t see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely shocked at how strong and smooth my hair felt all day.</li>
            <li>Nexuss Humectress and Biolage have some very comparable products for a little bit less right now that I am using.</li>
            <li>Overall, well worth the expense and the little extra hassle to have damage-free hair!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t good, wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>

            <li> I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t good, wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that there is not ver much of it, especially if ou have long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ripped off back in June, only now confirmed as fake.</li>
            <li> And I have a TON of frizzy, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> The product is a different color (green instead of white).  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are expensive, but I&#x27;ve spent much more money over the years on crappy products, plus you need much less product compared to other ones.  </li>
            <li> This new formula is very heavy and weighs my hair down without the detangling properties.</li>
            <li> Little too pricy for me and not enough results.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine/medium thin, shoulder length natural blonde (with partial highlights) and is DAMAGED as all get out for reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand.</li>
            <li> It arrived a few days later and packed so the product did not leak.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and is usually a dry and luster-less mess, but the conditioner made my hair softer.</li>
            <li> , I recomend this product, because any other conditioner made in my weakened hair this results.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and believe it supersedes any other product I have used..........</li>
            <li> This feeling continued into day 2, and it appears that every other day shampooing/conditioning is going to work for me.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, which compensates for its cost.  </li>
            <li> the bottle(s) arrived, I was slightly horrified when I realized how small they actually are.</li>
            <li> product comes out of container easy and if a very faint green color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money you pay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but the product is well absorbed and does not weigh my hair down or make it look dirty.</li>
            <li> it runs out of the container without squeezing, like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair too weighted down and lifeless.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess before I tried this conditioner and the shampoo.</li>
            <li> though these products are very expensive I have found they are worth every penny  </li>
            <li> Its a little pricey but works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> one criticism is that I find the line a little bit tricky to figure out.</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking severe breakage, instantaneous split ends, and the tangly texture of a dried up tumbleweed.</li>
            <li> But alas I think im going to have to buy the bigger sizes!</li>
            <li> my hair making it limp and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now.</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount in your hair and comb it through with a wide-tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to fork over my hard earned money to buy them.</li>
            <li> product was difficult to get out and was very thick and very white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> It was thin and runny and did not condition my hair whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with it at all and was not offered a refund.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive at salons.</li>
            <li> But extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> Received a fake product.</li>
            <li> ProConcepts sent me fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointing as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is too bad.</li>
            <li> she styled my hair and it was sooo crunchy and ugly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product to use on highlighted hair that is dry and dull from processing. Its a little pricey but works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite conditioner by Kerastase for years!!!  I have a lot of fine, highlighted, hair and this was perfect for detangling and offering just enough conditioning without weighing my hair down. This new formula is very heavy and weighs my hair down without the detangling properties. YUK!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess before I tried this conditioner and the shampoo. The ends were like straw from color damage and the roots were oily because that&#x27;s the way my hair is. It&#x27;s also very fine. I did a lot of research before coming upon this product and I can say I&#x27;m extremely pleased! My hair feels soft and strong. It&#x27;s shiny and looks very healthy. Well worth the money. I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This worked really well in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn&#x27;t see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor. Little too pricy for me and not enough results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake and would not recommend. It&#x27;s so thin it runs out of the container without squeezing, like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is awesome, my hair is really smooth and shiny, I recomend this product, because any other conditioner made in my weakened hair this results.....I like it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder length bleached hair. My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and my stylist recommended this brand. I also use the shampoo. I absolutely love this conditioner! My hair feels so soft and silky. Brushing my hair after getting out of the shower used to be an ordeal because it would tangle so much. Not anymore! The brush just glides through the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a grapefruit smell like the shampoo, but not as strong. Once it is rinsed out I really can&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use about a dime sized amount so the bottle I have (6.8ozs.) should last about 6 months or so. My bottle looks completely different from the one in the picture but it is the same product. I bought mine at the Sak&#x27;s Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though these products are very expensive I have found they are worth every penny  and I will continue to fork over my hard earned money to buy them.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is lightly scented. After using it all i missed the subtlety of the of the soft scent. It made my hair much more smooth than any other conditioner I could have used. My hair was still damaged, but it kept it in the best state it could have been with the damage. My hair is curly and is usually a dry and luster-less mess, but the conditioner made my hair softer. The only downside is that there is not ver much of it, especially if ou have long hair. I found myself trying to massage and spread it evenly without using too much but it still went out much faster than my shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feelings me straw. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  If I had time  I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
            <li> This is the only Kerastase product that I purchased that I wished I had saved my money.  This got some great reviews.  Hair textures are different from person to person and this one for my hair really did nothing.  The label says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;heat reconstructor milk for weakened hair\\&quot;.  You put it on your hair and leave it on.  Wasn&#x27;t good, wasn&#x27;t bad.  Did nothing.</li>
            <li> This product actually does make my one-process-bleach hair look much better. I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but the product is well absorbed and does not weigh my hair down or make it look dirty.</li>
            <li> This treatment leaves your hair in wonderful condition ....I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and believe it supersedes any other product I have used..........</li>
            <li> Please note that this review is for this shampoo used in conjunction with the Kerastase Resistance Bain Force Architecte Reconstructing Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my new hairstylist recommended this shampoo/conditioner, I hesitantly ($$$!!!) decided to give it a shot out of sheer desperation. My hair is fine/medium thin, shoulder length natural blonde (with partial highlights) and is DAMAGED as all get out for reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand. We&#x27;re talking severe breakage, instantaneous split ends, and the tangly texture of a dried up tumbleweed. I have tried so many products from drugstore to professional brands but have not seen much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle(s) arrived, I was slightly horrified when I realized how small they actually are. Since I am not blessed with a massive amount of hair, I was able to get away with using about a quarter-sized amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, concentrating the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on the ends. The difference was IMMEDIATE and very noticeable. I was absolutely shocked at how strong and smooth my hair felt all day. This feeling continued into day 2, and it appears that every other day shampooing/conditioning is going to work for me. Everyone&#x27;s hair challenges and solutions are so different, but if your situation sounds anything like mine, I&#x27;d recommend taking the plunge and giving this system a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one criticism is that I find the line a little bit tricky to figure out. I am still trying to decode the different &amp;#34;erosion levels&amp;#34; on the front of these bottles and even the Kerastase website does not seem to list all of the products that are available, so it&#x27;s not all that straighforward.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I recently started using Kerastase products, and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not doing it earlier.  Yes, they are expensive, but I&#x27;ve spent much more money over the years on crappy products, plus you need much less product compared to other ones.  And I have a TON of frizzy, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Last time I went to my hairdresser she styled my hair and it was sooo crunchy and ugly, I came home applied the heat cream, the balm and used the iron, it was instantly soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think twice, get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company shipped it super fast too.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Kerastase at a salon for years.  This product from Amazon was basically wrapped in saran wrapped and not sealed like the ones from the salon.  The product is a different color (green instead of white).  It burnt my eyes and after using it I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair.  I threw away both bottles.  I will never again buy salon products from a third party.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was recommended by my hairstylist.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was not up to Amazon standards.  This conditioner leaves my hair too weighted down and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Very so-so. Definitely not worth the money you pay. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of hydrating, especially if you have processed hair.</li>
            <li> This product works so well. My hair feels like silk.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle already. This conditioner does a better job making my fuzzy hair soft and shiny than any conditioner I ever tried before. Worth the price.   Recommend to anyone who has unruly hair.</li>
            <li> But alas I think im going to have to buy the bigger sizes! Especially that it one is only 6.8 ounces, I feel like it lasted me like 2 weeks!!! But still good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It has made a HUGE difference to the condition of my hair! My hair was damaged and using the Bain De Force shampoo and this conditioner has made my hair healthy and shiny. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Kerastase&#x27;s Ciment Anti-Usure is a nice alternative to using heavy conditioners every day.  I use it on alternate days as a light conditioner, alternating with a Biologue/Matrix product.  It is very light, smooth, with a pleasant aroma.  It is on the expensive side and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  If is was cheaper I&#x27;d probably use it every day.</li>
            <li> Kerastase is one of the best hair products on the market but it is expensive at salons. I ordered at a significant discount than what I normally pay at salons or through the companies website. It arrived a few days later and packed so the product did not leak. I will continue to order my favorite Kerastase products from this company.</li>
            <li> I heard a great deal about these products and I was expecting more. I have fine hair and it makes my hair shinier, but it drys it out and I don&#x27;t think it improves the quality.</li>
            <li> I had been using Kerastase for almost a year and I received this product only to find it was DEFINITELY not the conditioner I was used to.  It was thin and runny and did not condition my hair whatsoever.  It seemed more like sunscreen than a hair product.  It didn&#x27;t even smell the same.  I&#x27;m convinced this was NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a great fragrance and works very well, Does not leave hair limp. I swear my hair feels fuller.</li>
            <li> Good product.  But extremely expensive. Nexuss Humectress and Biolage have some very comparable products for a little bit less right now that I am using. Biolage-Fortetherapie&#x27;.  Unbelievable excellent results.  Highly recommend the Biolage Fort.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, which compensates for its cost.  Just put a small amount in your hair and comb it through with a wide-tooth comb.  Let it stay in your hair while you finish our shower.  It really helps with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing my friends rave about Kerastase products.  I think that this particular variety is not as good as others.  I will use it as it is conditioner and I need to use conditioner, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay as much for it again.  I haven&#x27;t notices any big difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The pink line is my favorite but I change it up with this and my hair feels wonderful and healthy!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo but geez, it&#x27;s expensive. It is a great volumizer and I certainly &amp;#34;ration&amp;#34; it when I wash my hair. However, it&#x27;s a modest size container and the price is high. I don&#x27;t buy this frequently because of the cost and honestly think the manufacturer could do MUCH better on the price.</li>
            <li> Just what my hair and scalp needed.  I will reorder it.  Also it smells good and does not require that much.</li>
            <li> Received a fake product. Very strong odor and EXTREMELY RUNNY. Never had and issue when purchasing from the Salon etc. Great results with the real product. So buyer beware!!!!</li>
            <li> While the service, packaging, delivery and seller are all impeccable, the product is no longer the same.  ;-((.  I have been an avid user of this conditioner. The old formula was MILES better. It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before. Now, it really over coats my hair making it limp and greasy looking. YUCK. (Only use a dime sized amount too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now. It is too bad. I now think this is an over priced, drug store type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, this is NOT the sellers fault. I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula. Disappointing as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, over-priced, Kerastase, you have lost a customer.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase. I have purchased this conditioner many times from the salon I go to and the one I ordered on Amazon was not the same. Was not happy with it at all and was not offered a refund. Instead I was told the stuff from the salon was probably out dated, ya right.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner rinse out!  No smells (as I am highly sensitive to smells) and the thickness of the product goes on nicely and feels cleansing on my hair.  Love it and it goes great with Kerastase Bain Age Recharge shampoo, that you can find on here as well!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist.  Have been using for awhile.  This was a good price which is so much more expensive at the salon.</li>
            <li> ProConcepts sent me fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used if for month, and it just didn&#x27;t seem right. Just purchased from salon and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real product comes out of container easy and if a very faint green color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake product was difficult to get out and was very thick and very white. Dried out my hair really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripped off back in June, only now confirmed as fake. RUN.</li>
            <li> This product really helped repair my hair after a color-correction. The only drawback is that instructions say to apply to towel-dried hair.  Overall, well worth the expense and the little extra hassle to have damage-free hair!</li>
