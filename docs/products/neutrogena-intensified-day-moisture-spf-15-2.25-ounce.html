    <ol>
            <li>reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price.</li>
            <li>Wonderful moisturizer with sun screen.  </li>
            <li>And it has spf 15, great quality/price ratio!</li>
            <li>and I am so happy.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling great all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a body lotion and my boyfriend steals it sometimes because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you&#x27;re wanting some SPF and moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve bought this from Amazon, it&#x27;s been a great purchase and sale.</li>
            <li>The price is good and it arrive in three days.</li>
            <li>Good Value for the Money Feels good on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I used the Nivea kind before, but then it must have gotten discontinued because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>now I&#x27;ve moved on to a Loreal kind.  </li>
            <li>And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good</li>
            <li>Effectively moisturizes providing a dewey glow without causing irritation or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a healthy glow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant as a face lotion, but you can use it anywhere on your body, and it feels lovely.</li>
            <li>Love that it has some sun protection too.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t like a jar as they feel its not sanitary</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the one that&#x27;s not intensified yet a thicker more moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>I slather my skin at night with an even more moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Neutrogena fan and like most of their products including this one.</li>
            <li>I generally love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>A lot of SPF lotion irritates my eyes but to me, that&#x27;s the most important area that I want to prevent wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;ve been on a huge Neutrogena kick</li>
            <li>I use this and the light night cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great not having to worry about putting on a second product.  </li>
            <li>This cream is nice in that it really does moisturize.  </li>
            <li>this rich to the touch cream makes the skin look luminous, soft, healthy!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather try something more natural (tried coconut oil and this worked better than the coconut oil</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, but typically it&#x27;s fairly even with not too much redness.</li>
            <li>This sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all yet makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li>I have probably THE most sensitive, reaction-prone skin of anyone I have ever met and this product literally healed my skin overnight.</li>
            <li>This products moisturizes my face from the moment I put it on in the morning (feels soooo good when my skin is especially dry).  </li>
            <li>Would love to see a little better price.&lt;br /&gt;Nelda</li>
            <li>It does leave me a little shiny, but in a good way because it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky soft and sinks in well after a shower - it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your skin like many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Covers generously and feeds the skin, no drying feeling or need to re-apply after first application</li>
            <li>I love this product, but can&#x27;t always find it in a regular store.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to see if it&#x27;s better than the Olay beauty fluid I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wear foundation to begin with (just a little coverup where needed), so I love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this is AMAZING because it&#x27;s really very similar to the Olay stuff, but it does the job and at this rate will last me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is the one item I won&#x27;t be without...and thanks to Amazon, I won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>With most beauty products, I like to try something different each time, but with this, I have found a true winner, and as long as Neutrogena makes it, I will buy it!</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using the product long, but so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this in the mornings, it seemed like it made my face oilier, but after I figured out to only use a tiny dab and my skin got used to it, it was totally fine.</li>
            <li>They seem to use high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena Intensified Day Moisture, SPF 15 product for a few years &amp; really love it.</li>
            <li>For the roughest of winter months, however, I do need a supplemental moisturizer (I use German Nivea creme on top of this), but I have found this is a pretty reliable, year round moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Most days it still feels too greasy, even if I only use a little bit, and it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>This daily moisturizer gives my skin the moisture it needs without causing more pimples and other blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I am very pale and burn easily, so having SPF 15 thrown in is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 because as I get older I feel I need a little more SPF, maybe even a 20.</li>
            <li>On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment.</li>
            <li>but, I mean, your hands are clean before you apply it right?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and am still only using the little bit that was stuck to the top of the cap when I opened</li>
            <li>Great for cold, windy weather.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to order several jars at once and have them sent directly to me.</li>
            <li>: After several weeks of use, I&#x27;ve decided that I really don&#x27;t like this for my face after all.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t feel they can wear makeup with it....just wait a few seconds &amp; blot lightly with a tissue... apply makeup &amp; blot again which seals your makeup ...</li>
            <li>The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day.</li>
            <li>, if you are sensitive to perfumes or just prefer not to smell like every one of the eight different things you put on in the morning, this is totally unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t irritating and does cause me to break out like most facial lotions.  </li>
            <li>For now this works, it seems to be much less harsh than most commercial facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the only one (and I&#x27;m talking one of maybe 20 that i&#x27;ve tried, both high end and inexpensive) that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in acne or strange red bumps.</li>

            <li> Well I must say this was a life-saver in a way when I started getting severely dry, red skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it at her house and it cleared up the problem (as long as I keep it applied) within a couple days.  </li>
            <li> After trying several different moisturizers by Olay and Neutrogena, I bought this one day because I thought the little pot would be easier to travel with than any pumps</li>
            <li> (dry skin) Bensley...</li>
            <li> Perhaps because of the quick NYC season switch from hot and humid to dry and cold combined with what I was using on my face, I developed this weird red rash of dry skin around my nose/mouth/chin area</li>
            <li> I went to bed with raw, red flaky skin, used this Neutrogena, and woke up GLOWING.</li>
            <li> I thought I didn&#x27;t like Neutrogena because other products have not worked with my skin....</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wouldn&#x27;t use any other daytime lotion than this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to two jars and when that&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, I need something thicker and it&#x27;s hard to find day creams (with SPF) at stores.  </li>
            <li> (less chance of a mess in my bag!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this advice to quite a few people</li>
            <li> I needed something for winter, something a little heavier than my usual moisturizer..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have weird and annoying combination skin that tends to be on the oily side, but also dries out really easily.</li>
            <li> Why is so hard to find a day cream????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 but every person that finds out, they tell me they thought I was in my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is with how shiny my face is after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looks like this cream has also been discontinued, so</li>
            <li> ...charging $40 for it is insane.  </li>

            <li> I love this cream.  I used the Nivea kind before, but then it must have gotten discontinued because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  My skin is so dry, I need something thicker and it&#x27;s hard to find day creams (with SPF) at stores.  Unfortunately, it looks like this cream has also been discontinued, so now I&#x27;ve moved on to a Loreal kind.  Why is so hard to find a day cream????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, but typically it&#x27;s fairly even with not too much redness. Perhaps because of the quick NYC season switch from hot and humid to dry and cold combined with what I was using on my face, I developed this weird red rash of dry skin around my nose/mouth/chin area and I thought I needed to see a dermatologist. It turns out I must have been having a reaction to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; moisturizer I was using that I thought, after 2 weeks, would have cured this issue. I went to bed with raw, red flaky skin, used this Neutrogena, and woke up GLOWING. I have probably THE most sensitive, reaction-prone skin of anyone I have ever met and this product literally healed my skin overnight. I use this and the light night cream and I am so happy. I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the only one (and I&#x27;m talking one of maybe 20 that i&#x27;ve tried, both high end and inexpensive) that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in acne or strange red bumps. I thought I didn&#x27;t like Neutrogena because other products have not worked with my skin....thank goodness I took a chance and bought this pair! It does leave me a little shiny, but in a good way because it is not greasy. It looks like a healthy glow and I don&#x27;t wear foundation to begin with (just a little coverup where needed), so I love it! I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using the product long, but so far I am very pleased with the results. THANK YOU NEUTROGENA.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, tending towards oily.  This daily moisturizer gives my skin the moisture it needs without causing more pimples and other blemishes.  It leaves my skin silky soft and sinks in well after a shower - it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your skin like many moisturizers.  For the roughest of winter months, however, I do need a supplemental moisturizer (I use German Nivea creme on top of this), but I have found this is a pretty reliable, year round moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After trying several different moisturizers by Olay and Neutrogena, I bought this one day because I thought the little pot would be easier to travel with than any pumps (less chance of a mess in my bag!).  Turns out to be just one of the positives of this moisturizer.  It keeps my skin feeling great all day.  Plus, I am very pale and burn easily, so having SPF 15 thrown in is an absolute must.  It&#x27;s great not having to worry about putting on a second product.  This products moisturizes my face from the moment I put it on in the morning (feels soooo good when my skin is especially dry).  With most beauty products, I like to try something different each time, but with this, I have found a true winner, and as long as Neutrogena makes it, I will buy it!</li>
            <li> This is the stuff. And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now. The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day. On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment. Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.  Wonderful moisturizer with sun screen.  Covers generously and feeds the skin, no drying feeling or need to re-apply after first application</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s it: this rich to the touch cream makes the skin look luminous, soft, healthy!  Great for cold, windy weather.  And it has spf 15, great quality/price ratio!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but can&#x27;t always find it in a regular store.  So much easier to order several jars at once and have them sent directly to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been on a huge Neutrogena kick and I wanted to see if it&#x27;s better than the Olay beauty fluid I have been using for years. It&#x27;s not really better, but it&#x27;s very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you need a TINY amount of this to moisturize your skin. It&#x27;s meant as a face lotion, but you can use it anywhere on your body, and it feels lovely. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and am still only using the little bit that was stuck to the top of the cap when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weird and annoying combination skin that tends to be on the oily side, but also dries out really easily. I wash my face in the morning and before bed and lotion both times. When I first started using this in the mornings, it seemed like it made my face oilier, but after I figured out to only use a tiny dab and my skin got used to it, it was totally fine. I can&#x27;t say that this is AMAZING because it&#x27;s really very similar to the Olay stuff, but it does the job and at this rate will last me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are sensitive to perfumes or just prefer not to smell like every one of the eight different things you put on in the morning, this is totally unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After several weeks of use, I&#x27;ve decided that I really don&#x27;t like this for my face after all. Most days it still feels too greasy, even if I only use a little bit, and it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin. I&#x27;m going back to Olay for my day lotion. I&#x27;ve been using this as a body lotion and my boyfriend steals it sometimes because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.  Effectively moisturizes providing a dewey glow without causing irritation or breakouts.  Love that it has some sun protection too.  Hope Neutrogena never changes the formula or stops making this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for decades.  It makes my face feel and look moisturized, but not greasy.  The SPF 15 is a bonus.  I can walk around in the sun for hours and not have to worry about getting burned.  This is the one item I won&#x27;t be without...and thanks to Amazon, I won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> I needed something for winter, something a little heavier than my usual moisturizer..This sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all yet makes my skin feel great..perfect under makeup..Most people don&#x27;t like a jar as they feel its not sanitary but, I mean, your hands are clean before you apply it right?  Plus I feel like I get to use all of it, not so when someting is in a tube.  I only gave it 4 because as I get older I feel I need a little more SPF, maybe even a 20.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re wanting some SPF and moisturizing lotion.  It&#x27;s just like the one that&#x27;s not intensified yet a thicker more moisturizing lotion.  I&#x27;m 43 but every person that finds out, they tell me they thought I was in my late 20&#x27;s.  When I was that young, dermatologist told me to prevent wrinkles and aged skin, use the highest possible spf you can stand and keep your skin moisturized as much as possible.  He said anti-aging lotions are not proven and just irritate the skin.  I slather my skin at night with an even more moisturizing lotion.  I&#x27;ve given this advice to quite a few people and I just wanted to use this review space to spread my doctor&#x27;s advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldn&#x27;t use any other daytime lotion than this.  It isn&#x27;t irritating and does cause me to break out like most facial lotions.  It&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon so I always purchase here rather than department stores.  Oh, I can also use it around my eyes.  A lot of SPF lotion irritates my eyes but to me, that&#x27;s the most important area that I want to prevent wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who asks me.  Every time I&#x27;ve bought this from Amazon, it&#x27;s been a great purchase and sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Neutrogena fan and like most of their products including this one. They seem to use high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Intensified Day Moisture, SPF 15 product for a few years &amp; really love it. For those who don&#x27;t feel they can wear makeup with it....just wait a few seconds &amp; blot lightly with a tissue... apply makeup &amp; blot again which seals your makeup ...It works for me.  I was wanting to order it through Amazon but it is almost the same price as in the store.  Would love to see a little better price.&lt;br /&gt;Nelda (dry skin) Bensley...Az</li>
            <li> I generally love Neutrogena products.  This cream is nice in that it really does moisturize.  My complaint is with how shiny my face is after I apply it.  I don&#x27;t wear full face-covering make-up, so am forced to use a powder to take away the extreme shine.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  My skin is very sensitive so I use it sparingly.  The price is good and it arrive in three days.</li>
            <li> ...charging $40 for it is insane.  I used to get it at Walmart but maybe they&#x27;ve stopped making it or something. I&#x27;m down to two jars and when that&#x27;s gone I guess I&#x27;ll just have to start using something else. I&#x27;d rather do without than get ripped off.</li>
            <li> Well I must say this was a life-saver in a way when I started getting severely dry, red skin under my eyes.  One of my friends had this and I tried it at her house and it cleared up the problem (as long as I keep it applied) within a couple days.  I&#x27;d rather try something more natural (tried coconut oil and this worked better than the coconut oil but I&#x27;ll keep searching).  For now this works, it seems to be much less harsh than most commercial facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the Money Feels good on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent!&lt;br /&gt;I always appreciate a moisturizer with spf 15!</li>
