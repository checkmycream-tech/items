            <li>The nurses asked what wonderful flowers I had brought, I asked them if the smell was offensive and told them what it was.</li>

            <li>I think the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>The whole room has a beautiful feminine smell.</li>
            <li>Most products that are popular today do not rinse well and they are too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love love love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love all Vita Bath products &amp; have for years....</li>
            <li>Love the Lavender scent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent was more like vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift, and though I love Vitabath, I do not like this scent.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this product has eliminated the need for additional creams and lotions after showering and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most of the people there will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>They remarked that it was wonderful and only smelled in her room which may explain why she got \\&quot;special treatment\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li>It smells like lilac flowers and the scent is so strong.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap perfume instead of lavender and chamomile.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was sulfate free</li>
            <li>Cheap smelling.</li>
            <li>Very good product, like the other flavors too.</li>
            <li>I told her she could take the rest of mine, but she will have to buy her own next time :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>This soap is the most intense soap I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>That is the main reason I love it so.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re used to organic, scent free and SLS free soaps, smells are super intense.</li>
            <li>and I had to immediately wash with a different kind of soap to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>I tossed after first use.  </li>
            <li>not shower with this before a hot date.</li>
            <li>My family has SLS allergies, and too many coco surfactants cause the same reaction in us.</li>
            <li>This soap still lathers very well even though it is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite intense.</li>
            <li>It should be appreciated by a friend or family member in the hospital.</li>
            <li>All the vitabath products always makes you so soft and leaves you soft smelling.</li>
            <li>The lavender is a natural antibacterial and the chamomile is a natural calmative.</li>
            <li>Also, it has quite a few suds for being SLS free, which leads me to believe that it has quite a bit of coco derivatives.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right it doesn&#x27;t smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend the beach blossom fragrance in the same line.</li>
            <li>The lavendar and chamomile scent takes me back to my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom, in a stale, &amp;#34;death is near&amp;#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> With daily showers I still have almost half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strange.</li>
            <li> and it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I used it on my niece that was in a coma along with the pink lilac and jasmine lotion.</li>
            <li> When she came out of the coma she told me to pack her bath stuff she got from the hospital</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so we make due with the Costco one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.  </li>
            <li> No, thank you, I&#x27;ll just stick with other kinds of Vitabath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few drops on a scrunchie is all you need to make a luxurious lather so a bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I hope she has since I&#x27;m planning to visit her in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it with the coordinating body spray and honestly I gave myself a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to get out of the shower not smiling.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Just too expensive as I am a nightly bath person who loves her Vitabath!</li>

            <li> This soap still lathers very well even though it is sulfate-free. It moisturizes well and it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005LB0HT2 Vitabath Bath and Shower Gel, Lavender Chamomile, 12 Ounce]]I absolutely love love love the scent. so different. The other reviews are right it doesn&#x27;t smell of lavender. I don&#x27;t know what it is but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love all Vita Bath products &amp; have for years....this has a lovely relaxing fragrance!</li>
            <li> Love the Lavender scent. It has a calming affect. Costco has a larger size with a pump, but not in this scent. Because of the size I ended up putting it into my traveling bag. My kids needs a pump to use it regularly so we make due with the Costco one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great! Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I keep getting to coconut as that works for me but the lavender simply does not work for me at all but that life as not all body&#x27;s are the same</li>
            <li> I HAVE GIVEN SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS A BOTTLE OF THIS.  IT SMELLS SO GOOD AND MAKES A PERSON FEEL GREAT!</li>
            <li> I did not smell any lavender or chamomile.  The scent was more like vanilla.  I tossed after first use.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product has eliminated the need for additional creams and lotions after showering and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I think the smell is amazing. All the vitabath products always makes you so soft and leaves you soft smelling.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower gel.  I love the smell and it lathers very well. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.  Great gift idea for anyone.  Natalie</li>
            <li> Smells so good in an understated way! A little goes a long way.  Very good product, like the other flavors too.</li>
            <li> Oh god. The lavendar and chamomile scent takes me back to my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom, in a stale, &amp;#34;death is near&amp;#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not shower with this before a hot date.</li>
            <li> Most products that are popular today do not rinse well and they are too strongly scented.  This is a great product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and though I love Vitabath, I do not like this scent. It smells like cheap perfume instead of lavender and chamomile. It gave me a bit of a headache in the shower and I had to immediately wash with a different kind of soap to get rid of the smell. No, thank you, I&#x27;ll just stick with other kinds of Vitabath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that DOES smell like lavender and chamomile, try California Baby calming soap.</li>
            <li> Definitely a Vitabath winner!  Wonderful, silky feel and nice fragrance.  Just too expensive as I am a nightly bath person who loves her Vitabath!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t quite smell like lavander or chamomile...had to return it. But I highly recommend the beach blossom fragrance in the same line.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite intense. All the vita bath products I&#x27;ve tried are. That is the main reason I love it so. It does stay with you. I chose lotion to complement it. The lavender is a natural antibacterial and the chamomile is a natural calmative. I find it hard to get out of the shower not smiling. The whole room has a beautiful feminine smell. A few drops on a scrunchie is all you need to make a luxurious lather so a bottle lasts a very long time. I bought the last bottle for myself about 3 months ago. With daily showers I still have almost half a bottle left. I am ordering another bottle today for my aunt that has just entered a nursing home. I&#x27;m sure most of the people there will enjoy it. I used it on my niece that was in a coma along with the pink lilac and jasmine lotion. The nurses asked what wonderful flowers I had brought, I asked them if the smell was offensive and told them what it was. They remarked that it was wonderful and only smelled in her room which may explain why she got \\&quot;special treatment\\&quot; afterwards. I think they wanted to apply the lotion too.  She doesn&#x27;t remember my being there, but she does remember the massages and the wonderful smell. When she came out of the coma she told me to pack her bath stuff she got from the hospital so she could take it home. What ever they were using there had made her skin softer than it had ever been. I told her she could take the rest of mine, but she will have to buy her own next time :) I hope she has since I&#x27;m planning to visit her in a few weeks. If you are not fond of the smell don&#x27;t toss it! It should be appreciated by a friend or family member in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was sulfate free &amp; I thought the lavender would be relaxing. I was wrong. The scent is very strange. Cheap smelling. I used it with the coordinating body spray and honestly I gave myself a horrible headache. It smells one way in the bottle, but when you use it? Yuck! It also left me itchy from head to toe.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like lavender and chamomile. It smells like lilac flowers and the scent is so strong. My daughter likes it so we are keeping it, but I will have to try a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re used to organic, scent free and SLS free soaps, smells are super intense. This soap is the most intense soap I have ever smelled. It makes Burt&#x27;s Bees soap seem unscented. Also, it has quite a few suds for being SLS free, which leads me to believe that it has quite a bit of coco derivatives. My family has SLS allergies, and too many coco surfactants cause the same reaction in us. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this soap again and I would not recommend it to others, even people without an SLS allergy.</li>
