            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Went with this one, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>so I decided as a precaution it was time to use my own soap/sponge.</li>
            <li>They do kind of pill after awhile,  </li>
            <li>I liked it, I will continue buying the</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and leaves you feeling refreshed and smelling good too.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t find a shower sponge that I like more.</li>
            <li>Still good after several months, keeps shape, great texture, and I&#x27;m buying again.</li>
            <li>I love how it exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>I love these sponges.  </li>
            <li>On the plus, it does leave my skin smooth, but it kind of hurts getting there.</li>
            <li>I like the loop at the top</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li>(I always use it before shaving to avoid getting ingrown hairs), and makes my body wash more foamy.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and feels really good..</li>
            <li>and they are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Works fine for what it is</li>
            <li>After about 2 months of use of this sponge ( I purchased about 3 so far from different sellers), my acne is gone, my skin looks clean and flawless.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>It is still not a bad sponge</li>
            <li>I had recently gotten a case of acute hives all over my body which freaked me out to the nth degree.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exfoliating, all right.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you hang it dry place after using it.</li>
            <li>They are gentle but yet exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I like how it suds up so much.</li>
            <li>They do not lather as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have 2 of them to tell you that much :D&lt;br /&gt;-Day</li>
            <li>Has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>At first sight I was skeptical but after using it I found it worked great.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does become softer and is more gentle on my softer skin over time; however, on the down side, as it becomes softer, it does not exfoliate as well.</li>
            <li>recently-3 months- also gone on a special diet (no cheese, no fats, no red meats, and no bread carbs)</li>
            <li>I love that this sponge doesn&#x27;t get gross over time, actually exfoliates very well</li>
            <li>and I definitely like it better than the traditional mesh loofahs which just seem to fall apart on me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This sponge came highly recommended from the product reviews, so I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>It was a great stiff, scratchy, scrubber at first, but after a few weeks it started falling apart.</li>
            <li>Its strong enough for my body, but also gentle enough for my face.</li>
            <li>Kind of small, kind of rough the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I love it on my calves, back, neck and outer arms, but it is a little too rough on more tender skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold its shape for very long, and the outside of it starts to ball up (kind of like the inside of fleece material), but it also doesn&#x27;t fall apart in pieces like other sponges I have used.</li>
            <li>Its not too soft either and its durable.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t know that I will be able to use any other bath sponges in the future, this one has me hooked!</li>
            <li>My skin gets gross in winter and my old sea sponge was wearing out, so I looked for something new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new product to use in the future.</li>
            <li>and, if you have sensitive skin or a low threshold to pain, that will be the case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and recently their quality has diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty stiff and scratchy, which is the idea of an exfoliater.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like it would exfoliate much from how it feels dry, but wait til you get it wet</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Kind of small, kind of rough the first few weeks.  Maybe I need to stay away from exfoliating sponges.</li>
            <li> I had recently gotten a case of acute hives all over my body which freaked me out to the nth degree. Went to the doctor and no one including myself could figure out why, so I decided as a precaution it was time to use my own soap/sponge. Went with this one, and it&#x27;s amazing. Still good after several months, keeps shape, great texture, and I&#x27;m buying again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t know that I will be able to use any other bath sponges in the future, this one has me hooked! I love how it exfoliates my skin. Before purchasing this sponge, I used to have some minor acne on my shoulders, neck, upper chest, and back. After about 2 months of use of this sponge ( I purchased about 3 so far from different sellers), my acne is gone, my skin looks clean and flawless. I must add I have recently-3 months- also gone on a special diet (no cheese, no fats, no red meats, and no bread carbs) so that might also have had an impact on how my skin looks because my daily main nutrients come from raw fruits and vegetables. Some might say this sponge is too rough and, if you have sensitive skin or a low threshold to pain, that will be the case. I don&#x27;t, so this sponge is perfect to me.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.Just the right size and feels really good..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and continue to like it and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was a great stiff, scratchy, scrubber at first, but after a few weeks it started falling apart.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber but eventually the material pills</li>
            <li> I love these sponges.  I use them in my shower and bath.  They are gentle but yet exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge to replace a loofah.  It works okay, but is very scratchy.  I will not be buying it again, as I believe the loofah works better for my needs and is not as uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and recently their quality has diminished considerably.  I&#x27;m looking for a new product to use in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exfoliating, all right. On the plus, it does leave my skin smooth, but it kind of hurts getting there. The size and shape make it awkward to hold, and because the outer covering is so thick, it&#x27;s hard to get it rinsed really clean. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I go out of my way to order these because they are the only bath sponge that exfoliates well.  I like the loop at the top so I can hang it to dry.  Good sponge!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy Spongeola body sponges all the time, but sadly they were discontinued.  Found these and they are pretty good.  They do kind of pill after awhile,  I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Felt like particles of glass. Using this as a cleaning sponge now; it&#x27;s unbearable as a bath sponge.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  It has a little loop to hang in the shower.  I like how it suds up so much.</li>
            <li> I liked it, I will continue buying the</li>
            <li> At first sight I was skeptical but after using it I found it worked great.  Really easy to use and leaves you feeling refreshed and smelling good too.  I recommend the exfoliating body sponge to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works fine for what it is but I will not be buying any more. They do not lather as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this sponge twice and I definitely like it better than the traditional mesh loofahs which just seem to fall apart on me. It is pretty stiff and scratchy, which is the idea of an exfoliater. I love it on my calves, back, neck and outer arms, but it is a little too rough on more tender skin. It doesn&#x27;t hold its shape for very long, and the outside of it starts to ball up (kind of like the inside of fleece material), but it also doesn&#x27;t fall apart in pieces like other sponges I have used. On the plus side, it does become softer and is more gentle on my softer skin over time; however, on the down side, as it becomes softer, it does not exfoliate as well. It is still not a bad sponge and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge!  My skin gets gross in winter and my old sea sponge was wearing out, so I looked for something new.  This sponge came highly recommended from the product reviews, so I decided to give it a shot.  I love it!  It didn&#x27;t seem like it would exfoliate much from how it feels dry, but wait til you get it wet and it works amazingly.  My skin has never been softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this sponge for the last year or so and I honestly can&#x27;t find a shower sponge that I like more. The Earth Therapeutics sponge was sold out the last time I tried buying it on Amazon, so I bought a different sponge that looked similar but it doesn&#x27;t compare at all. I love that this sponge doesn&#x27;t get gross over time, actually exfoliates very well (I always use it before shaving to avoid getting ingrown hairs), and makes my body wash more foamy. Nothing else exfoliates like it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it! At first I thought it would be a bit rough, but I was wrong. Its not too soft either and its durable. Its strong enough for my body, but also gentle enough for my face. I have 2 of them to tell you that much :D&lt;br /&gt;-Day</li>
            <li> Use this every day. Has really improved my skin. Just make sure you hang it dry place after using it.</li>
