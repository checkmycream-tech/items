            <li>Best nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This polish looks great for about 10 min.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for nails.</li>
            <li>It went on good</li>
            <li>I used this polish for years &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>But the best thing is that my nails have not broken this week!</li>
            <li>Its really great as a bottom coat, polish goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>and I liked how it looked.</li>
            <li>As good as any name brand top coat.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again when I need more</li>
            <li>I have grown out my nails after many years of acrylics then gels.  </li>
            <li>With the Healthy Hoof...</li>
            <li>As with most products nowadays, this has changed &amp; is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have decent nails of my own!  </li>
            <li>It peeled off very quickly and did nothing that was helpful.  </li>
            <li>This lacquer came off too easily</li>
            <li>Gena Healthy Hoof Lacquer Protein Treatment I have found to be the best for weak and splitting nails.</li>
            <li>When the salon where I get my nails done stopped selling it, I was excited to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Lol, so first time I tried it, no big deal.</li>
            <li>I have been using the hoof lacquer for many years as it really helps with my nails.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a very shiny top cost and does prevent chiping.</li>
            <li>Pealed quickly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, she said it made her nails strong, strong enough to not break and make her nails grow, and believe me it did the job, one day i was putting it on</li>
            <li>As a polish alone it chips of right away.</li>
            <li>As a top coat it last longer.</li>
            <li>It keeps them strong and healthy as long as you keep this over regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>It really strength ends your nails and makes them grow faster.</li>
            <li>This nail polish really, really, really works.</li>
            <li>My polish stays on so much longer with this product.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this after a co-worker highly recommended this.</li>
            <li>Love the cuticle cream, this is a waste.</li>
            <li>she raved about how a family member and her daughter both used it and it left there super soft and bendable nails super hard and the paint did not peal at all which it normally does.</li>
            <li>, my nails were still soft, bendable, and paint still pealed off in sheets.</li>
            <li>so I will just stick with regular clear polish.</li>
            <li>Mine is the same way, they bend, are soft, and the paint peals off in sheets.</li>
            <li>I really this your nails really do get hard and they are not breaking like them</li>

            <li> My nails are dry in 25-30 seconds later.</li>
            <li> When I went to use a second time, a few days later, could not open bottle at all.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.my nails are soft weak brittle.use</li>
            <li> Was really of no value  </li>
            <li> but I am doing other things to prevent my nails from splitting; so I don&#x27;t know it this is helping or not.  </li>
            <li> She has always had problems with &amp;#34;breaking nails&amp;#34; due to washing dishes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the order.</li>

            <li> This polish looks great for about 10 min. Then it starts to peel and chip so I will just stick with regular clear polish.</li>
            <li> Gena Healthy Hoof Lacquer Protein Treatment I have found to be the best for weak and splitting nails. It really strength ends your nails and makes them grow faster.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for nails. It keeps them strong and healthy as long as you keep this over regular nail polish.  If you use it alone, it tends to chip nails.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish ever. Hardens &amp; smooths your nails. Stops them from cracking, splitting, breaking. Heals nails; doesn&#x27;t harm them. Lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> This nail polish really, really, really works. My nails are dry in 25-30 seconds later.</li>
            <li> i purchased this after a co-worker highly recommended this. she raved about how a family member and her daughter both used it and it left there super soft and bendable nails super hard and the paint did not peal at all which it normally does. Mine is the same way, they bend, are soft, and the paint peals off in sheets. I purchased this and it did nothing for me, my nails were still soft, bendable, and paint still pealed off in sheets. It works for some but not all so i guess either you love it or hate it.....</li>
            <li> starts to chip away after a few days</li>
            <li> This product works.I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.my nails are soft weak brittle.use this as recommended and you will have hard nails.I also use the nail cream with it.</li>
            <li> My nails split and I use this to add some strength.  It seems to have helped but I am doing other things to prevent my nails from splitting; so I don&#x27;t know it this is helping or not.  It has not made things worse.</li>
            <li> This did the job. It went on good and I liked how it looked. I would buy it again when I need more</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with chipped nail polish and this made my nail color come off in sheets.  Love the cuticle cream, this is a waste.</li>
            <li> Again, I bought this item for a friend. She has always had problems with &amp;#34;breaking nails&amp;#34; due to washing dishes. She claims that this product has solved the problem.</li>
            <li> It peeled off very quickly and did nothing that was helpful.  Was a general disappointment.  Was really of no value  that I could see.</li>
            <li> Peels faster than my OPI base coat! And I wear gloves when I do the dishes so it&#x27;s not that!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This polish just peels off and is not helpful for stopping my breaking splitting nails.</li>
            <li> As a polish alone it chips of right away. As a top coat it last longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the hoof lacquer for many years as it really helps with my nails.  I have grown out my nails after many years of acrylics then gels.  With the Healthy Hoof...I have decent nails of my own!  Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> As with most products nowadays, this has changed &amp; is not what it used to be. I used this polish for years &amp; loved it. When the salon where I get my nails done stopped selling it, I was excited to find it here on amazon. But the consistency is thinner than it used to be and lacks the luster that it once had.</li>
            <li> Lol, so first time I tried it, no big deal. As good as any name brand top coat. Pealed quickly. When I went to use a second time, a few days later, could not open bottle at all. Not worth the order. Go to any drug store for something you can actually open a second time..</li>
            <li> My polish stays on so much longer with this product.  Love it.  I will purchase again and again.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li> I was looking on youtube to find something to strengthen my nails, and i came across a video i don&#x27;t remember the video anyways, she said it made her nails strong, strong enough to not break and make her nails grow, and believe me it did the job, one day i was putting it on, i put in on everyother day (when i had time ) and before i knew it i had some nails, i will always buy this product when i need a nail strenghtner, i would recommend this product to peoples who had false nails and need their natural nails strengthened up</li>
            <li> This lacquer came off too easily so I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really this your nails really do get hard and they are not breaking like them were</li>
            <li> Its really great as a bottom coat, polish goes on really smooth. It also makes a very shiny top cost and does prevent chiping. But the best thing is that my nails have not broken this week! I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
