    <ol>
            <li>I tried to make the best of this product, but after three weeks I just couldn&#x27;t put up with it any longer.</li>
            <li>Great price too, will keep using!</li>
            <li>Wonderful stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great volume size.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>By putting a good amount in the palm of my hand, this conditioner has a citrus smell and no, but does not smell of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel good about using it on myself or my kids.  </li>
            <li>Lets start with the good:  </li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It feels almost like putting lotion on your hair and is about as effective.</li>
            <li>Plus I figured this would be healthier and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>smells wonderfull, love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many conditioners on her hair but stopped after I found Avalon Lavender Nourishing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer said, it feels like nothing and even applying more doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>Others are commenting on the great smell - I didn&#x27;t detect much of a lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>so it sounded more enticing (and</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients list on this product.  </li>
            <li>AVALON USED TO SMELL GREAT, SO MUCH THAT I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO A SHOWER</li>
            <li>THERE IS BETTER THAN AVALON IS NOW.</li>
            <li>I looked more closely at the label.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when it received a 4 (the recommended safe level for products is 0-3).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pretty scent, not overpowering and the ingredients are better than most conditioners out there, BUT it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>It does smell great and makes my hair feel soft and clean though!</li>
            <li>very fine hair and Pantene tended to dry it out easily, this conditioner is gentle and smells delightful.</li>
            <li>I have fine, brown, curly, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree ended up being fine.</li>
            <li>it has a very pretty lavender smell, it&#x27;s mostly organic, and there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to make my hair LOOK spectacular</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smooth hair at all.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would work better because I want to use more natural products but without the conditioning, I was pulling hair out when I combed it after I washed and conditioned it.</li>
            <li>Works great, wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair &amp;</li>
            <li>I actually use it in place of shaving cream/gel on a regular basis and my legs feel great as well!</li>
            <li>I love this product and the larger size makes it much more affordable.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t spill during transportation and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Note: If you have straight, fine hair like I do and want some body, you won&#x27;t get it from this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have well behaved straight and smooth hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that there was some \\&quot;natural stuff&#x27; thrown on top</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>have fine, sometimes frizzy bleach damaged hair, and was pleasantly surprised by the results!</li>
            <li>Plus I like to use it on days when I&#x27;m not shampooing to rinse my hair with - even though it has oils and feels heavy/somewhat oily on, and even feels a little oily when rinsing it dries nicely and feels clean.</li>
            <li>(Highly recommend the body lotion)!!</li>
            <li>I have been using natural SLS free shampoo and conditioner for 6 months</li>
            <li>, THEY SAID IT WAS THEIR FIRST CALL LIKE</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down--her little sausage curls are nice and bouncy--but leaves it soft and free of frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Although the brand name, Avalon Organics, implies the contents are organic, the fine print says only 70% is.</li>
            <li>think this conditioner could serve a very oily hair and buttery.</li>
            <li>Over the years I am a hair product junkee looking for something that really works.</li>
            <li>Very unimpressed.  </li>
            <li>though recently they have &#x27;cleaned their act&#x27; significantly, and they now claim \\&quot;70% of ingredients are organic\\&quot;...  </li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this for the scent.</li>
            <li>the amount of a regular conditioner and your hair will still not feel soft, smooth, and silky out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I have very curly dry hair and needed a conditioner that makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but I have to use more conditioner with this product than I do with other natural products.</li>
            <li>which normally air dries in around an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My store happened to be out of the conditioner that I normally use</li>
            <li>I recently tried switching to the Avalon thickening conditioner, but oddly this one works better for my fine hair, so I switched back.</li>
            <li>Shiny, fluffy - not as shiny as its ever been but for a more natural product, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li>Even when applying it in the shower it never made it easy for me to run my fingers through my hair or felt soft and smoothing as other conditioners do for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s a highly rated organic product with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I tried using small amounts, large amounts, rinsing well, rinsing lightly.  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing: it smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I SEE REVIEWS SAYING THE SAME BELOW THIS REVIW, AN DON MANY SITES.  </li>
            <li>Afterward, I could hardly get a comb through my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It completely strips my hair of all oil.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>It has a lovely smell and the bottle is so big it lasts for a few months for me.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and this conditioner makes my hair manageable and feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Then I thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough, so the next time I used a little more.</li>
            <li>While this conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like it is immediately working in the shower, unlike Pantene brands, which immediately make your hair feel super silky and untangled, when my hair has dried it feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Such brands as Avalon Organics, Nature&#x27;s Gate and Giovanni make organic claims on products whose main cleansing and moisturizing ingredients are generally made without any organic material whatsoever and are usually composed in significant part from petrochemicals.\\&quot;aken from [...]</li>

            <li>My daughter has VERY curly, dry, tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It used to be even worse in the past when they first showed up on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Enticed by the name, I happily jumped on the bandwagon and kept buying their shampoos, conditioners and lotions (foolishly without reading the Ingredient label), only to find out A LOT later that they all were laden with all kinds of harmful chemicals</li>

            <li>Such level of dishonesty in business practice is completely unacceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, YOU CAN BARELY SMELL ANYTHING WHEN YOU USE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It was a bit more expensive than my normal brand</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that needs a particular type of conditioner - one that won&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy or limp to style, but also one that will keep it shiny and help stop dry fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>When it was dry, it was still very tangled and very dry.</li>
            <li>I got this on a whim because the other conditioner I wanted to buy and loooved (nexxus moisturizing) has a new, crappy formula.</li>

            <li> little less so Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Stearyl Alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped buying this line long time ago, even though the overall quality MIGHT BE higher than other commercial brands.  </li>
            <li> Now for the disappointment:  it&#x27;s better to order a lot because you will need 2-3x</li>
            <li> I have arbitrarily chosen the conditioner, but the following applies to EVERY SINGLE product in this company line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you have extremely oily hair and don&#x27;t care about your cosmetic dollars, I would advise that if you come across this product on the store shelves or online, you move on to the next product.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner it would take 24 HOURS to air dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any issues with dry hair until using this product.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and bleached out</li>
            <li> I am mixed my mom is white and my father is black and I have tried every product for black and white and every other color that they would make hair products for.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very harsh and seems to strip all natural oils from the hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I typically like Avalon products, but this conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me or my teen.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand how a product could be so heavy and yet so non-nourishing at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like using no conditioner and as such a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Once rinsed, my hair felt rough -- rougher than if I hadn&#x27;t used this product at all.</li>
            <li> It left my teen&#x27;s AND my hair heavy, dull, and flat.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to AVALON for their body lotions and other hair products.  </li>
            <li> (I use other products for that), but I always get compliments on how my hair SMELLS.</li>
            <li> Other than Garnier Fructis</li>
            <li> dissapoined and had to replace with other pump</li>
            <li> No matter what I did this conditioner left my hair weighed down feeling very heavy and yet not moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Hard to open the locked pump mechanism.</li>
            <li> No success.</li>
            <li> AVALON HAS FAILED BECAUSE THEY GOT GREEDY, THEY FOUND OUT HOW MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical though because other natural products sometimes leave my hair dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results were negative, my hair dry and tangled term, my hair had not smell the conditioner (I had no smell or lavender or lemon).&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those doubting what I just wrote or not familiar with the facts, pls.</li>
            <li> It is quite a thick conditioner, so I use less than with other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks limp after it dries and isn&#x27;t shiny.</li>
            <li> ,CHEAP CRAP</li>
            <li> I have gotten duped by them in the past and spent a lot of money on their products before realizing how blatantly dishonest their marketing tactics were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The worst part is I am stuck with these huge bottles.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed and am looking for a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> THEY CHANGED THE INGREDIENTS BECAUSE THEY GOT BIG CONTRACTS WITH SUPERMARKETS, SO NOW THEIR PRODUCTS ARE CRAP</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> ingredients, among others, are still questionable: Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Coumarin, Limonene, Linalool and</li>

            <li> I typically like Avalon products, but this conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me or my teen.  I have fine, brown, curly, shoulder length hair.  It left my teen&#x27;s AND my hair heavy, dull, and flat.  I thought I didn&#x27;t wash it out enough but that is not the case, as I rinsed over and over again.  It has a pretty scent, not overpowering and the ingredients are better than most conditioners out there, BUT it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.  Will not buy again.  Kudos to AVALON for their body lotions and other hair products.  I guess it would be trial and error for each individual.  (Highly recommend the body lotion)!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I tried using small amounts, large amounts, rinsing well, rinsing lightly.  No matter what I did this conditioner left my hair weighed down feeling very heavy and yet not moisturized.  Even when applying it in the shower it never made it easy for me to run my fingers through my hair or felt soft and smoothing as other conditioners do for me.  After using this conditioner it would take 24 HOURS to air dry my hair.  That&#x27;s right. If I showered in the morning, my hair would remain damp until I woke up the next morning.  I have well behaved straight and smooth hair which normally air dries in around an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how a product could be so heavy and yet so non-nourishing at the same time.  I tried to make the best of this product, but after three weeks I just couldn&#x27;t put up with it any longer. I have been using natural SLS free shampoo and conditioner for 6 months and I have never run into this before.  Save yourself the money and the bad hair days, do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim because the other conditioner I wanted to buy and loooved (nexxus moisturizing) has a new, crappy formula. Plus I figured this would be healthier and better for the environment. I was a little skeptical though because other natural products sometimes leave my hair dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, sometimes frizzy bleach damaged hair, and was pleasantly surprised by the results! Shiny, fluffy - not as shiny as its ever been but for a more natural product, I&#x27;ll take it! Plus I like to use it on days when I&#x27;m not shampooing to rinse my hair with - even though it has oils and feels heavy/somewhat oily on, and even feels a little oily when rinsing it dries nicely and feels clean. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this conditioner makes my hair manageable and feel soft and healthy. It smells nice too. It is quite a thick conditioner, so I use less than with other conditioners.  I actually use it in place of shaving cream/gel on a regular basis and my legs feel great as well!</li>
            <li> By putting a good amount in the palm of my hand, this conditioner has a citrus smell and no, but does not smell of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did everything that is written on the bottle of conditioner; masajie for 3 minutes, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were negative, my hair dry and tangled term, my hair had not smell the conditioner (I had no smell or lavender or lemon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this conditioner could serve a very oily hair and buttery.</li>
            <li> I have given this shampoo and conditioner a shot for at least 7 hair washings now and it is horrible. It completely strips my hair of all oil. I have never had any issues with dry hair until using this product. I wash my hair about 3 times a week so it is not that I wash my hair so often that I am stripping it of oil. The worst part is I am stuck with these huge bottles. I will probably use the shampoo for body wash and see how that goes and the conditioner to shave but at this point I may just have to call it a loss and toss both.</li>
            <li> Does not lubricate or soften hair. Not even while in the shower. I followed the instructions and even left it on longer than recommended. It made no difference. My hair was just as tangled after rinsing it off. Basically, it does no conditioning, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I always try to use organics on my hair.  My store happened to be out of the conditioner that I normally use so I thought I would try the Avalon Nourishing Lavender Conditioner.  It was a bit more expensive than my normal brand but I needed to buy something so I choose the Avalon.  I tend to have dry hair so I need something that will help me with that.  After only one use, I noticed that it was as if I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner at all.  Then I thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough, so the next time I used a little more. My hair was a disaster.  Looked horrible, my hair was breaking off when I was trying to comb through it after the shampoo/conditioning and when it dried it looked as though my hair hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week. So now I&#x27;m in a bad mood and out $10.  Unless you have extremely oily hair and don&#x27;t care about your cosmetic dollars, I would advise that if you come across this product on the store shelves or online, you move on to the next product.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this for the scent. It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to make my hair LOOK spectacular (I use other products for that), but I always get compliments on how my hair SMELLS.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smooth hair at all. Kept trying. No success. Lost hair instead. Bought 2. Big mistake. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that needs a particular type of conditioner - one that won&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy or limp to style, but also one that will keep it shiny and help stop dry fly-aways.  The Avalon lavender conditioner does both of those things for me.  I recently tried switching to the Avalon thickening conditioner, but oddly this one works better for my fine hair, so I switched back.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get lavender scent, received tea tree, is the only reason for 3 stars. I like all of Avalon Organics products. The tea tree ended up being fine.</li>
            <li> smells wonderfull, love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY curly, dry, tangle-prone hair. I have tried many, many conditioners on her hair but stopped after I found Avalon Lavender Nourishing Conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down--her little sausage curls are nice and bouncy--but leaves it soft and free of frizz and fly-aways. I comb her hair while the conditioner works, and even though it isn&#x27;t exactly a breeze, it sure makes it easier for me and less painful for her. I pair it up with Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner after the bath--an unbeatable combo for her hair! Note: If you have straight, fine hair like I do and want some body, you won&#x27;t get it from this conditioner. It does smell great and makes my hair feel soft and clean though!</li>
            <li> I have curly nappy frizzy Native American Hair. I am mixed my mom is white and my father is black and I have tried every product for black and white and every other color that they would make hair products for. Other than Garnier Fructis this is the only product that I can use that actually works well. I prefer this over Garnier Fructis because it&#x27;s Organic. It has a lovely smell and the bottle is so big it lasts for a few months for me. If you are unsure give it a try especcially if you have curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner looks and feels creamy in your hands but doesn&#x27;t condition the hair.  As one reviewer said, it feels like nothing and even applying more doesn&#x27;t help.  I was very disappointed in this product.  I used it in conjunction with the Avalon Lavender Shampoo.  The shampoo is very harsh and seems to strip all natural oils from the hair and scalp.  Others are commenting on the great smell - I didn&#x27;t detect much of a lavender scent.  It smells sort of like dog cleansing products.</li>
            <li> I have arbitrarily chosen the conditioner, but the following applies to EVERY SINGLE product in this company line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s commonly known fact that most of the cosmetic companies claiming to be organic actually are NOT (such as Nature&#x27;s Gate, Kiss My Face, Dessert Essence, Jason, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;The reason Avalon (NON)\\&quot;Organic\\&quot; is the worst offender in my eyes is&lt;br /&gt;1. the fact that they actually have the audacity to use the word in their name, while their products still contain synthetic, and potentially carcinogen ingredients and&lt;br /&gt;2. I have gotten duped by them in the past and spent a lot of money on their products before realizing how blatantly dishonest their marketing tactics were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be even worse in the past when they first showed up on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Enticed by the name, I happily jumped on the bandwagon and kept buying their shampoos, conditioners and lotions (foolishly without reading the Ingredient label), only to find out A LOT later that they all were laden with all kinds of harmful chemicals, it&#x27;s just that there was some \\&quot;natural stuff&#x27; thrown on top so it sounded more enticing (and misleading).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though recently they have &#x27;cleaned their act&#x27; significantly, and they now claim \\&quot;70% of ingredients are organic\\&quot;...  where does it leave the remaining 30%?&lt;br /&gt;(these ingredients, among others, are still questionable: Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Coumarin, Limonene, Linalool and little less so Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Stearyl Alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped buying this line long time ago, even though the overall quality MIGHT BE higher than other commercial brands.  Such level of dishonesty in business practice is completely unacceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  For those doubting what I just wrote or not familiar with the facts, pls. do search on \\&quot;Organic Fraud in Cosmetics\\&quot; or similar topic.  You will be surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Here is just one example (taken from [...]&lt;br /&gt;(Quote):&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Such brands as Avalon Organics, Nature&#x27;s Gate and Giovanni make organic claims on products whose main cleansing and moisturizing ingredients are generally made without any organic material whatsoever and are usually composed in significant part from petrochemicals.\\&quot;aken from [...]&lt;br /&gt;(Quote):&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Such brands as Avalon Organics, Nature&#x27;s Gate and Giovanni make organic claims on products whose main cleansing and moisturizing ingredients are generally made without any organic material whatsoever and are usually composed in significant part from petrochemicals.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s a highly rated organic product with natural ingredients.  Not crazy about the way it works in my hair; perhaps it&#x27;s because I have fairly thick hair but I have to use more conditioner with this product than I do with other natural products.</li>
            <li> Works great, wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair &amp; this was it. Great price too, will keep using!</li>
            <li> Over the years I am a hair product junkee looking for something that really works. My hair is dry and bleached out so I thought I would try this product but it does not work on my hair at all. I can&#x27;t even finish the product, I am throwing it out. It does not condition my hair like I thought it would from reading the reviews. I was hoping it would work better because I want to use more natural products but without the conditioning, I was pulling hair out when I combed it after I washed and conditioned it. I tried Avalon shampoo too and am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients list on this product.  I feel good about using it on myself or my kids.  Wonderful stuff.  Great volume size.</li>
            <li> While this conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like it is immediately working in the shower, unlike Pantene brands, which immediately make your hair feel super silky and untangled, when my hair has dried it feels so soft and manageable. Also my hair appears shinier than with a Pantene conditioner. I have very fine hair and Pantene tended to dry it out easily, this conditioner is gentle and smells delightful.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the larger size makes it much more affordable.  Hard to open the locked pump mechanism.</li>
            <li> They were out of stock so it took longer to restock and get it to us.  I ordered two bottles of it, but only received one.  I like the product however, and was reimbursed for the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would shop here again.</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair and needed a conditioner that makes my hair smooth and soft. This one doesn&#x27;t help at all. It&#x27;s like using no conditioner and as such a waste of my money.  I cannot get through my hair even with the biggest comp after using this product. Beside that I don&#x27;t smell any Lavender, actually I don&#x27;t smell anything at all. Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Not the worst but not the best conditioner. It smells of lavender but has another musky smell mixed in. Hair looks limp after it dries and isn&#x27;t shiny. Go with herbal essence.</li>
            <li> Lets start with the good:  it has a very pretty lavender smell, it&#x27;s mostly organic, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. It didn&#x27;t spill during transportation and arrived quickly. Now for the disappointment:  it&#x27;s better to order a lot because you will need 2-3x the amount of a regular conditioner and your hair will still not feel soft, smooth, and silky out of the shower. It feels almost like putting lotion on your hair and is about as effective. I was rather disappointed and am looking for a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> AVALON USED TO SMELL GREAT, SO MUCH THAT I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO A SHOWER, IT WAS LITERALLY AROMATHERPY, BUT NOT ANYMORE. THEY CHANGED THE INGREDIENTS BECAUSE THEY GOT BIG CONTRACTS WITH SUPERMARKETS, SO NOW THEIR PRODUCTS ARE CRAP, YOU CAN BARELY SMELL ANYTHING WHEN YOU USE THE PRODUCT,CHEAP CRAP THAT IS OUT THERE IS BETTER THAN AVALON IS NOW. I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM HOW I FELT, THEY SAID IT WAS THEIR FIRST CALL LIKE THAT, BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I SEE REVIEWS SAYING THE SAME BELOW THIS REVIW, AN DON MANY SITES.  AVALON HAS FAILED BECAUSE THEY GOT GREEDY, THEY FOUND OUT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY&#x27;D MAKE IF THEY TOOK OUT THE QUALITY STUFF IN THEIR PRODUCTS, AND SAID BASICALLY SCREW THE CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li> when i got the package the shampoo bottle was leaking and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;very dissapoined and had to replace with other pump</li>
            <li> Very unimpressed.  Even as I was rinsing it out it did not felt like it had softened my hair. When it was dry, it was still very tangled and very dry. Useless. Save your money.</li>
            <li> My family has been switching to organic and all-natural personal care products, so when my husband saw this conditioner he bought a bottle for me. &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is HORRIBLE stuff. Putting it on in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re actually using a product designed to condition hair. Once rinsed, my hair felt rough -- rougher than if I hadn&#x27;t used this product at all. Afterward, I could hardly get a comb through my fine, straight hair. The only positive thing: it smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I looked more closely at the label. Although the brand name, Avalon Organics, implies the contents are organic, the fine print says only 70% is. That was enough to send me to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database to look up the rating on this stuff. Imagine my surprise when it received a 4 (the recommended safe level for products is 0-3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: bad for hair, bad for those looking for organics, bad for everyone&#x27;s health.</li>
