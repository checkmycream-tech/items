            <li>Great price for a good brand of picks.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>These are spicy on the lips but it feels good and soothing.</li>
            <li>good value tho as you get alot for the money.</li>
            <li>good quality compared to others i have used though...</li>
            <li>but I loved the tea tree flavor and was never a menthol smoker.</li>
            <li>These have been a good investment.  </li>
            <li>recommend this two-pack though, because you get to try &#x27;em both for a good price.</li>
            <li>Both are good for chewing and both sides have flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>, the plastic containers they come in are good for your pocket.</li>
            <li>Use one for good breath and to keep me from snacking on food all day.</li>
            <li>Good price, and they taste darn good.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon sticks are REALLY good</li>
            <li>The tree oil was the one that didn&#x27;t taste that good</li>
            <li>These things are a great tasting counter habit that I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
            <li>I love to chew on a toothpick and these are absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>We love them!</li>
            <li>Breath is amazing...</li>
            <li>The Cinnamon flavored one took some getting used to, as it has a nice sting to it.</li>
            <li>Nice chewing sticks</li>
            <li>These chewing sticks are nice to have around.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon is a nice flavor.</li>
            <li>Nice flavors and does give me that &amp;#34;Bite&amp;#34</li>
            <li>original flavor is great.</li>
            <li>They make ur mouth feel clean!!</li>
            <li>flavors are good, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too strong as others have said.</li>
            <li>They chip easy and the flavor is not as good as another prodcut I use.</li>
            <li>Came as advertised but the Tea Tree is very strong and is sometimes overpowering.  </li>
            <li>These are literally flavored toothpicks, you cannot \\&quot;chew\\&quot; on them as they will break up like toothpicks very easily.  </li>
            <li>Very strong flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>cinnamon is pretty good though!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>Both taste amazing, but for some reason, the tea tree ones hold up better to \\&quot;chewing\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>It is not overly huge in the package witch is a good thing so you can carry it in you pocket.</li>
            <li>Original is really good.</li>
            <li>, the mouth feel is amazing with the coolness of the tea tree or the heat of the cinnamon, the intensity of the flavor makes you be deliberate about not just smashing it up in your mouth, and its easy to store them in your pocket with getting smashed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cinnamon sticks smell great &amp; keeps your mouth fresh, but they   taste strong ass heck</li>
            <li>They were shipped super fast and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The quality of the toothpicks is excellent overall.</li>
            <li>Much better than anything you will find in a restaurant.</li>
            <li>But it does keep your breathe smelling like cinnamon :-)</li>
            <li>I was turned on to these recently and they are a wonderful invention.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but its ok.  </li>
            <li>I really love these sticks.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re a lot more bearable.</li>
            <li>Something to do, freshens your breath, cleans your teeth, but better in almost all ways.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling feeling of breathing in with the tea tree.</li>
            <li>That being said, the strong flavor does make your breath smell good and because it is antiseptic they do clean your mouth while you chew them.</li>
            <li>Many have raved on here how the sticks hold up to chewing.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have a habit of getting all fidgety in class and while I&#x27;m doing things around the house, and I also tend to eat more than I should</li>
            <li>I also kept one pack in the car and withe the heat the stick fell apart real quick.</li>
            <li>I love these tooth picks.</li>
            <li>Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying these.</li>
            <li>So I love these, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend using them unless you&#x27;re trying to break a habit.</li>
            <li>They were okay</li>
            <li>They need to be a tad more stronger.</li>
            <li>Keeps them safe in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I love these flavored Tea Tree Chewing sticks.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more palatable tasting tooth pick.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon was ok.</li>
            <li>ok wait.</li>
            <li>I love 100%.</li>
            <li>Warning: They have a VERY strong taste, so it may be very overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li>I will warn you that the cinnamon ones are also very strong (think &amp;#34;hotter than Red Hots&amp;#34; strong) but very good if you&#x27;re okay with that.</li>
            <li>Love the easy to close lid.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers I have also quit smoking and am trying all kinds of things to distract myself, these are great!</li>
            <li>Leaves the breath tasting nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>You can focus on it more if you need or want to, you can use it to pick at your teeth and clean your gums</li>
            <li>They have great flavor and work better than regular toothpicks to me.</li>
            <li>Thank you for marketing a easy to use item.</li>
            <li>Strong toothpicks tho....</li>
            <li>They are both really strong</li>
            <li>the taste is strong and you can use the.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly strong.</li>
            <li>Strong flavor.</li>
            <li>However, once at its peak, the flavor is acutely strong.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves how strong the flavor is.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t splinter like other toothpicks, the tate is fine, and best of all, there&#x27;s no calories.</li>
            <li>They have a good flavor and last a long time and the price was great!</li>
            <li>The sticks themselves are strong and clean cut.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, I choose these flavored toothpicks and I am happy enough I did.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon is really spicy and nice.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon ones are fantastic.</li>
            <li>However, the cinnamon ones are fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>These are a lot better to use than regular tooth picks and are good for smoking cessation.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the original flavor and the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>they are that good, and are a broad spectrum antiseptic.</li>
            <li>Love these toothpicks, very flavorful, don&#x27;t break or splinter to easy.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving the cinnamon ones to my brother after a while and kept the original ones for myself.</li>
            <li>&#x27;em, but I&#x27;m going to stick to the original flavor from now on.</li>
            <li>Has a unique flavor.  </li>
            <li>All of the reviews that I read raved about the original and slammed the cinnamon-flavored pack.  </li>
            <li>I perfer the Original.</li>
            <li>u don&#x27;t want that clean feeling to go away.</li>
            <li>Makes the mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>The original on the other hand has a great flavor to me.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is a good plus, but they arent as strong for chewing as I expected.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon flavor is great and has a little spice to it (which i like) and the tea tree oil lasts for hours and makes your breath very fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty strong</li>
            <li>the Original peppermint flavor is not quite as fresh.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s not your reason just chew on them to keep your mouth fresh and to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to find them in Amazon</li>
            <li>so I run out super quick.</li>
            <li>They are like putting a pack of Big Red Gum in your mouth all at once (which is awesome).  </li>
            <li>any case, I love em, highly recommend em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are awesome and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been off cigarettes for 6 weeks now, and I carry a little container of these with me to take the edge off, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The Original Tea Tree is best described as a bitter mint and it lasts a tremendously long time.</li>
            <li>The flavor does last, and I am sure there are those who enjoy these or find some value to them, but I&#x27;ll be shucked if I can figure out what it is.</li>
            <li>The tea tree toothpicks are outstanding, and both the tea tree and cinnamon are made with birchwood and natural oils/extracts.</li>
            <li>These things are so useful</li>
            <li>Good taste initially but then turns to a straight chemical bitterness.</li>
            <li>Fun to chew and suck, and keeps my breath fresh to death.</li>
            <li>From Immediately breaking or chipping off pieces in your mouth ton being able to gnaw gnaw nom nom stress relief and still have a complete pick in your mouth that isn&#x27;t in shreds.</li>
            <li>pretty much too strong for my taste but may son seemed to like them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an illusion right?</li>
            <li>One of them is cinnamon flavored, while the other is the original mint flavored kind.  </li>
            <li>but then there is an odd after taste...not extremely pleasant...</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the original flavored ones, the cinnamon flavored ones were a little too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>These are a good alternative to gum, smoking (if you do), chewing on fingernails, dirt or any other thing that you may put into your mouth!</li>
            <li>Overall, if you want some good, quality chewing sticks, I would definitely recommend the original ones.</li>
            <li>ok - If you like chewing on something - Green tea not to minty, cin kinda hot but ok hope this helps</li>
            <li>ask my wife ;)</li>
            <li>THE LABEL COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really help freshen breath and they&#x27;re just fun to chew.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon flavor do have some real kick and most people I let try them are surprised at the intense flavor.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li>when I first heard of them.</li>
            <li>My husband is an avid tooth pick chewer.</li>
            <li>First time I purchase.....</li>
            <li>First off.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased I had thicker sticks</li>
            <li>sometimes when I first put them in.</li>
            <li>Some my find the taste a little strong, but thats what I like about them :)</li>
            <li>The reviews here raved at how strong it was and how they could barely keep it in their mouth.  </li>
            <li>The Cinnamon are very strong but good for chewing and the tea tree flavor is kinda bland and more brittle not great for chewing.</li>
            <li>These are made from better wood so that does allow for longer chewing, though the flavor is not nearly as strong and I find myself replacing my pick very quickly.</li>
            <li>prefer the tea tree to the cinnamon, as the cinnamon is slightly more intense, but isn&#x27;t as lasting.</li>
            <li>The plastic box they are stored is easily refillable, and compact enough to carry anywhere.</li>
            <li>I got them for a friend of mine and he told me that he uses them and the grip it has does really give you some of the motion you would use when handling a cigerrete they felt the cinnamon was a little hot but liked the tea one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a recent non-smoker, so I&#x27;ll spare you all the \\&quot;gospel\\&quot; that my counterparts generally spout, and simply say these are a great fix for anyone trying to quit.    </li>
            <li>One toothpick can last me 3+ hours easily... and still have flavor the whole time.  </li>
            <li>The regular sticks are fine.  </li>
            <li>I remember reading someone else who said they&#x27;d gladly pay a little more for the thicker sticks to come back, I agree.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the original flavor is really strong and something I only use on occasion when my breath is not great.</li>
            <li>I should note that they aren&#x27;t an appetite suppressant, nor do they really do THAT much for your dental health (asked my very qualified dentist about them, he said they&#x27;re about as helpful for your teeth as unplugging your phone charger is for your electric bill).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>My husband used these to quit smoking and they worked very well.</li>
            <li>I had these for 3(?) days, and I was chain chewing them the whole time, swallowing the oil.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil just tastes very minty.</li>
            <li>(thanks America).</li>
            <li>I have to say Hotlix have a much stronger cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li>My co-worker chews them when she is hungry and it has helped her from snacking to much as well..</li>
            <li>Although the seller only sent me cinnamon - I&#x27;ve used the Original a lot</li>
            <li>That was the main reason that I purchased the item.</li>
            <li>The flavor was decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hard core cinnamon fan (used to make my own sticks with cinnamon oil) and based on what I tasted here</li>
            <li>awesome - helped with quitting bad habits</li>
            <li>and it just gets sent right back out, unchanged.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and I can now live with it.  </li>
            <li>Recently tried to quit smoking and wanted to add an additional back up to my new smoke   free lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Considering the price of smokes these are a crazy good alternative, and worth giving them a shot.</li>
            <li>The menthol flavor is not for me, it tastes too much like wood with a slight hint of cool.</li>
            <li>They are just your average cheap toothpicks... after the first chew the toothpick instantly splinters...</li>
            <li>They use actual cinnamon oil, and therefore have some spiciness for first time users.</li>
            <li>As I stated before the cinnamon ones were a little too strong for my taste, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>The package I received contained 2-Cinnamon packs and was clearly stated on the packaging that they were both cinnamon.</li>
            <li>After the incident, while texting this young woman, I went into a realm of manic-depressive psychosis that led me to believe I was both the anti-christ and christ reborn.</li>
            <li>so may be a natural botox type thing for women...?</li>
            <li>I tried Hotlix recently and reminisced about how much nicer these were.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that bothersome though because the cinnamon is so powerful.</li>
            <li>; Right after that I went to fold out a piece of stage, and the entire 400-500lb slab of metal fell back and landed on my ankle.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the initial burn everything else is A ok.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil can be a little bit harsh on the stomach at times, but it really does the job of freshening breath far better than chewing gum and mouth sprays.</li>
            <li>We went to the same high school</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like chewing a whole pack of Big Red bubble gum!!</li>
            <li>I was a smoker for 5 years and since I bought these a few months ago they&#x27;ve helped me tremendously in kicking the habit.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have stated that the tea tree oil/scent leaves a funny aftertaste.</li>
            <li>These chewing sticks (toothpicks) have been a great way for me to drop some bad habits like chewing nails, straws, or tobacco.</li>
            <li>These chew sticks have so much flavor and last a long time, and I still have plenty.</li>
            <li>It barely tastes like cinnamon &amp; the flavor (</li>
            <li>The cinnamon ones will burn your lips if your not careful</li>
            <li>Once they get wet they will start to break down quite quickly...</li>
            <li>I suppose I was expecting larger toothpicks, these are the size of general toothpicks.</li>
            <li>the flavor is poor and extremely strong...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use them at all, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> An excellent alternative breath freshener to chemical-additives in chewing gum and the akwardness of carrying mouth wash.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon are the best ever.  </li>
            <li> Both are perfect for those cravings you get or will get while quitting smoking (today is day 3 for me)</li>

            <li> Great price for a good brand of picks.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> These are spicy on the lips but it feels good and soothing.</li>
            <li> good value tho as you get alot for the money.</li>
            <li> good quality compared to others i have used though...</li>
            <li> but I loved the tea tree flavor and was never a menthol smoker.</li>
            <li> These have been a good investment.  </li>
            <li> recommend this two-pack though, because you get to try &#x27;em both for a good price.</li>
            <li> Both are good for chewing and both sides have flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> , the plastic containers they come in are good for your pocket.</li>
            <li> Use one for good breath and to keep me from snacking on food all day.</li>
            <li> Good price, and they taste darn good.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon sticks are REALLY good</li>
            <li> The tree oil was the one that didn&#x27;t taste that good</li>
            <li> These things are a great tasting counter habit that I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
            <li> I love to chew on a toothpick and these are absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> We love them!</li>
            <li> Breath is amazing...</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon flavored one took some getting used to, as it has a nice sting to it.</li>
            <li> Nice chewing sticks</li>
            <li> These chewing sticks are nice to have around.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon is a nice flavor.</li>
            <li> Nice flavors and does give me that &amp;#34;Bite&amp;#34</li>
            <li> original flavor is great.</li>
            <li> They make ur mouth feel clean!!</li>
            <li> flavors are good, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too strong as others have said.</li>
            <li> They chip easy and the flavor is not as good as another prodcut I use.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised but the Tea Tree is very strong and is sometimes overpowering.  </li>
            <li> These are literally flavored toothpicks, you cannot \\&quot;chew\\&quot; on them as they will break up like toothpicks very easily.  </li>
            <li> Very strong flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> cinnamon is pretty good though!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Both taste amazing, but for some reason, the tea tree ones hold up better to \\&quot;chewing\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> It is not overly huge in the package witch is a good thing so you can carry it in you pocket.</li>
            <li> Original is really good.</li>
            <li> , the mouth feel is amazing with the coolness of the tea tree or the heat of the cinnamon, the intensity of the flavor makes you be deliberate about not just smashing it up in your mouth, and its easy to store them in your pocket with getting smashed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cinnamon sticks smell great &amp; keeps your mouth fresh, but they   taste strong ass heck</li>
            <li> They were shipped super fast and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The quality of the toothpicks is excellent overall.</li>
            <li> Much better than anything you will find in a restaurant.</li>
            <li> But it does keep your breathe smelling like cinnamon :-)</li>
            <li> I was turned on to these recently and they are a wonderful invention.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but its ok.  </li>
            <li> I really love these sticks.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re a lot more bearable.</li>
            <li> Something to do, freshens your breath, cleans your teeth, but better in almost all ways.</li>
            <li> I love the cooling feeling of breathing in with the tea tree.</li>
            <li> That being said, the strong flavor does make your breath smell good and because it is antiseptic they do clean your mouth while you chew them.</li>
            <li> Many have raved on here how the sticks hold up to chewing.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have a habit of getting all fidgety in class and while I&#x27;m doing things around the house, and I also tend to eat more than I should</li>
            <li> I also kept one pack in the car and withe the heat the stick fell apart real quick.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth picks.</li>
            <li> Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying these.</li>
            <li> So I love these, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend using them unless you&#x27;re trying to break a habit.</li>
            <li> They were okay</li>
            <li> They need to be a tad more stronger.</li>
            <li> Keeps them safe in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I love these flavored Tea Tree Chewing sticks.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more palatable tasting tooth pick.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon was ok.</li>
            <li> ok wait.</li>
            <li> I love 100%.</li>
            <li> Warning: They have a VERY strong taste, so it may be very overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li> I will warn you that the cinnamon ones are also very strong (think &amp;#34;hotter than Red Hots&amp;#34; strong) but very good if you&#x27;re okay with that.</li>
            <li> Love the easy to close lid.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers I have also quit smoking and am trying all kinds of things to distract myself, these are great!</li>
            <li> Leaves the breath tasting nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> You can focus on it more if you need or want to, you can use it to pick at your teeth and clean your gums</li>
            <li> They have great flavor and work better than regular toothpicks to me.</li>
            <li> Thank you for marketing a easy to use item.</li>
            <li> Strong toothpicks tho....</li>
            <li> They are both really strong</li>
            <li> the taste is strong and you can use the.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly strong.</li>
            <li> Strong flavor.</li>
            <li> However, once at its peak, the flavor is acutely strong.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves how strong the flavor is.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t splinter like other toothpicks, the tate is fine, and best of all, there&#x27;s no calories.</li>
            <li> They have a good flavor and last a long time and the price was great!</li>
            <li> The sticks themselves are strong and clean cut.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, I choose these flavored toothpicks and I am happy enough I did.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon is really spicy and nice.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon ones are fantastic.</li>
            <li> However, the cinnamon ones are fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> These are a lot better to use than regular tooth picks and are good for smoking cessation.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the original flavor and the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> they are that good, and are a broad spectrum antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Love these toothpicks, very flavorful, don&#x27;t break or splinter to easy.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving the cinnamon ones to my brother after a while and kept the original ones for myself.</li>
            <li> &#x27;em, but I&#x27;m going to stick to the original flavor from now on.</li>
            <li> Has a unique flavor.  </li>
            <li> All of the reviews that I read raved about the original and slammed the cinnamon-flavored pack.  </li>
            <li> I perfer the Original.</li>
            <li> u don&#x27;t want that clean feeling to go away.</li>
            <li> Makes the mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> The original on the other hand has a great flavor to me.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is a good plus, but they arent as strong for chewing as I expected.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon flavor is great and has a little spice to it (which i like) and the tea tree oil lasts for hours and makes your breath very fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty strong</li>
            <li> the Original peppermint flavor is not quite as fresh.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not your reason just chew on them to keep your mouth fresh and to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to find them in Amazon</li>
            <li> so I run out super quick.</li>
            <li> They are like putting a pack of Big Red Gum in your mouth all at once (which is awesome).  </li>
            <li> any case, I love em, highly recommend em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are awesome and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been off cigarettes for 6 weeks now, and I carry a little container of these with me to take the edge off, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The Original Tea Tree is best described as a bitter mint and it lasts a tremendously long time.</li>
            <li> The flavor does last, and I am sure there are those who enjoy these or find some value to them, but I&#x27;ll be shucked if I can figure out what it is.</li>
            <li> The tea tree toothpicks are outstanding, and both the tea tree and cinnamon are made with birchwood and natural oils/extracts.</li>
            <li> These things are so useful</li>
            <li> Good taste initially but then turns to a straight chemical bitterness.</li>
            <li> Fun to chew and suck, and keeps my breath fresh to death.</li>
            <li> From Immediately breaking or chipping off pieces in your mouth ton being able to gnaw gnaw nom nom stress relief and still have a complete pick in your mouth that isn&#x27;t in shreds.</li>
            <li> pretty much too strong for my taste but may son seemed to like them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an illusion right?</li>
            <li> One of them is cinnamon flavored, while the other is the original mint flavored kind.  </li>
            <li> but then there is an odd after taste...not extremely pleasant...</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the original flavored ones, the cinnamon flavored ones were a little too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> These are a good alternative to gum, smoking (if you do), chewing on fingernails, dirt or any other thing that you may put into your mouth!</li>
            <li> Overall, if you want some good, quality chewing sticks, I would definitely recommend the original ones.</li>
            <li> ok - If you like chewing on something - Green tea not to minty, cin kinda hot but ok hope this helps</li>
            <li> ask my wife ;)</li>
            <li> THE LABEL COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really help freshen breath and they&#x27;re just fun to chew.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon flavor do have some real kick and most people I let try them are surprised at the intense flavor.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> when I first heard of them.</li>
            <li> My husband is an avid tooth pick chewer.</li>
            <li> First time I purchase.....</li>
            <li> First off.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased I had thicker sticks</li>
            <li> sometimes when I first put them in.</li>
            <li> Some my find the taste a little strong, but thats what I like about them :)</li>
            <li> The reviews here raved at how strong it was and how they could barely keep it in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> The Cinnamon are very strong but good for chewing and the tea tree flavor is kinda bland and more brittle not great for chewing.</li>
            <li> These are made from better wood so that does allow for longer chewing, though the flavor is not nearly as strong and I find myself replacing my pick very quickly.</li>
            <li> prefer the tea tree to the cinnamon, as the cinnamon is slightly more intense, but isn&#x27;t as lasting.</li>
            <li> The plastic box they are stored is easily refillable, and compact enough to carry anywhere.</li>
            <li> I got them for a friend of mine and he told me that he uses them and the grip it has does really give you some of the motion you would use when handling a cigerrete they felt the cinnamon was a little hot but liked the tea one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent non-smoker, so I&#x27;ll spare you all the \\&quot;gospel\\&quot; that my counterparts generally spout, and simply say these are a great fix for anyone trying to quit.    </li>
            <li> One toothpick can last me 3+ hours easily... and still have flavor the whole time.  </li>
            <li> The regular sticks are fine.  </li>
            <li> I remember reading someone else who said they&#x27;d gladly pay a little more for the thicker sticks to come back, I agree.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the original flavor is really strong and something I only use on occasion when my breath is not great.</li>
            <li> I should note that they aren&#x27;t an appetite suppressant, nor do they really do THAT much for your dental health (asked my very qualified dentist about them, he said they&#x27;re about as helpful for your teeth as unplugging your phone charger is for your electric bill).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My husband used these to quit smoking and they worked very well.</li>
            <li> I had these for 3(?) days, and I was chain chewing them the whole time, swallowing the oil.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil just tastes very minty.</li>
            <li> (thanks America).</li>
            <li> I have to say Hotlix have a much stronger cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> My co-worker chews them when she is hungry and it has helped her from snacking to much as well..</li>
            <li> Although the seller only sent me cinnamon - I&#x27;ve used the Original a lot</li>
            <li> That was the main reason that I purchased the item.</li>
            <li> The flavor was decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard core cinnamon fan (used to make my own sticks with cinnamon oil) and based on what I tasted here</li>
            <li> awesome - helped with quitting bad habits</li>
            <li> and it just gets sent right back out, unchanged.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I can now live with it.  </li>
            <li> Recently tried to quit smoking and wanted to add an additional back up to my new smoke   free lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of smokes these are a crazy good alternative, and worth giving them a shot.</li>
            <li> The menthol flavor is not for me, it tastes too much like wood with a slight hint of cool.</li>
            <li> They are just your average cheap toothpicks... after the first chew the toothpick instantly splinters...</li>
            <li> They use actual cinnamon oil, and therefore have some spiciness for first time users.</li>
            <li> As I stated before the cinnamon ones were a little too strong for my taste, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The package I received contained 2-Cinnamon packs and was clearly stated on the packaging that they were both cinnamon.</li>
            <li> After the incident, while texting this young woman, I went into a realm of manic-depressive psychosis that led me to believe I was both the anti-christ and christ reborn.</li>
            <li> so may be a natural botox type thing for women...?</li>
            <li> I tried Hotlix recently and reminisced about how much nicer these were.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that bothersome though because the cinnamon is so powerful.</li>
            <li> ; Right after that I went to fold out a piece of stage, and the entire 400-500lb slab of metal fell back and landed on my ankle.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial burn everything else is A ok.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil can be a little bit harsh on the stomach at times, but it really does the job of freshening breath far better than chewing gum and mouth sprays.</li>
            <li> We went to the same high school</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like chewing a whole pack of Big Red bubble gum!!</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 5 years and since I bought these a few months ago they&#x27;ve helped me tremendously in kicking the habit.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have stated that the tea tree oil/scent leaves a funny aftertaste.</li>
            <li> These chewing sticks (toothpicks) have been a great way for me to drop some bad habits like chewing nails, straws, or tobacco.</li>
            <li> These chew sticks have so much flavor and last a long time, and I still have plenty.</li>
            <li> It barely tastes like cinnamon &amp; the flavor (</li>
            <li> The cinnamon ones will burn your lips if your not careful</li>
            <li> Once they get wet they will start to break down quite quickly...</li>
            <li> I suppose I was expecting larger toothpicks, these are the size of general toothpicks.</li>
            <li> the flavor is poor and extremely strong...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use them at all, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>
            <li> Although I have no complaints, I feel that the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> These are the only flavored toothpicks I prefer and they last a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> but they do not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I would say rather that the tea tree is an alternate taste after the brunt of the cinnamon starts to dissipate some, which takes quite a long time.</li>
            <li> cinnamon tastes sweeter to me, but doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cinnamon ones by far, but went through the all none the less.  </li>
            <li> I always keep a pack in my car for long drives.  </li>
            <li> I plan to keep a pack of each of these on hand at all times for as long as it takes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it lasts for a long time -</li>
            <li> Keep their flavor for a long time</li>
            <li> They taste well, and hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> It takes them a long time to be chewed threw.</li>
            <li> Be warned though, it will chap your lips if you keep it in for that long.</li>
            <li> The other ones are gross.  </li>
            <li> I did not have that experience at all and as a matter of fact, the sticks held up no differently and began to splinter in my mouth just like all of the other sticks</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was detecting ANY cinnamon flavor at all through the other flavor profile that was on it.  </li>
            <li> The reviews about the original flavor are completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> I got these because regular toothpicks you buy at the food store usually give me a sore throat, apparently it&#x27;s the wood glue.</li>
            <li> and the other is flat with a notch, like a totem pole.</li>
            <li> Bought these a little while back and just not finished them</li>
            <li> Well made and only a couple are not completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> JUST BE CAREFUL, DON&#x27;T CHAIN CHEW AND SWALLOW THE OIL.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no cinnamon flavor at all.</li>
            <li> The flavor is a little strange but it grows on you.  </li>
            <li> Why these come up when searching for cinnamon toothpicks is beyond me other than they are a toothpick.  </li>
            <li> and I guess we always fantasized about each other from afar??</li>
            <li> On the other hand the cinnamon tastes like its name.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are toothpicks.</li>
            <li> But even after all that, I still prefer this brand over ALL the other chewing sticks out there.</li>
            <li> I thought I could actually chew on these sticks for a long time but found them to be just as weak as a plain toothpick.</li>
            <li> None of the previous reviews mentioned how the cinnamon variety might cause swollen lips and sore gums from the menthol content, but gee whiz that&#x27;s a thing.</li>
            <li> the cinnamon ones tend to splinter quite a bit finer than the tea tree, which can fill your mouth with mess.     </li>
            <li> I tried twizzlers and red vines but of course that&#x27;s not good for your teeth</li>
            <li> ...though I would recommend shopping around... a little pricey on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so i would try them in little doses.</li>
            <li> I soaked them in water for a little while to remove some of the oil</li>
            <li> Quit cold turkey thanks to these.</li>
            <li> I chew these everyday, going through about 200(1 pack) in two months.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s missing one star just for the thinner picks.</li>
            <li> ; I am missing by not smoking.  </li>
            <li> The Plain Tea Tree oil ones take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li> Im not saying that tea tree oil is horrible i just like the cinnamon more.</li>
            <li> I carry a few around with me when I get the urge and to also use as toothpicks after a meal!</li>
            <li> These are chewing sticks and while they have pointed ends they aren&#x27;t that sharp not great as tooth picks.</li>
            <li> Idk about other smokers trying to kick the habit but the stress and being tense is something you may go through and thin toothpicks are not the business.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon flavor sucks.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes your mouth tingle and almost feel numb.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost ridiculous to me that I didn&#x27;t start buying them two years ago</li>
            <li> But the quantity is so small I doubt that it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon was very weak and is probably attributable to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cinnamon, like a cinnamon stick flavoring.  </li>
            <li> They leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> but if it tastes weird, that makes it a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Nothing artificial.</li>
            <li> , I prefer the artificial cinnamon I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im my time, but never tasted anything this bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in the cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> of now, I&#x27;m disappointed in the purchase and the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> terrible taste</li>

            <li> terrible taste, i have eaten some nasty stuff im my time, but never tasted anything this bad, maybe others don&#x27;t mind it but i do. not for me.</li>
            <li> Why these come up when searching for cinnamon toothpicks is beyond me other than they are a toothpick.  The flavor does last, and I am sure there are those who enjoy these or find some value to them, but I&#x27;ll be shucked if I can figure out what it is.</li>
            <li> Bought these a little while back and just not finished them so I figure I would review them. The pack you buy comes with two flavors. One of them is cinnamon flavored, while the other is the original mint flavored kind.  The quality of the toothpicks is excellent overall. Much better than anything you will find in a restaurant. While I enjoyed the original flavored ones, the cinnamon flavored ones were a little too strong for my taste. After chewing on them for a while, they started to burn the sides of my mouth. It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use them at all, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t pleasant either. I ended up giving the cinnamon ones to my brother after a while and kept the original ones for myself. Overall, if you want some good, quality chewing sticks, I would definitely recommend the original ones. As I stated before the cinnamon ones were a little too strong for my taste, but maybe that&#x27;s just me. Also, I heard these are a great way to stop smoking if you are looking for something to help you with that.</li>
            <li> An excellent alternative breath freshener to chemical-additives in chewing gum and the akwardness of carrying mouth wash. The tea tree oil can be a little bit harsh on the stomach at times, but it really does the job of freshening breath far better than chewing gum and mouth sprays. I&#x27;ve been using these types of chewing sticks for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and last a long time.  Well made and only a couple are not completely smooth.  Best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the original flavor and the cinnamon. None of the previous reviews mentioned how the cinnamon variety might cause swollen lips and sore gums from the menthol content, but gee whiz that&#x27;s a thing. It&#x27;s only if you use these constantly, back to back, over the course of a day, so DON&#x27;T DO THAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &#x27;em, but I&#x27;m going to stick to the original flavor from now on.</li>
            <li> I used to have these types of toothpicks when I was a kid and I couldn&#x27;t find these toothpicks any ware else. These are spicy on the lips but it feels good and soothing. I&#x27;m lucky to find them in Amazon</li>
            <li> Bought them for my hubby and he says he likes them. Warning: They have a VERY strong taste, so it may be very overwhelming at first. But it does keep your breathe smelling like cinnamon :-)</li>
            <li> I was turned on to these recently and they are a wonderful invention.  One toothpick can last me 3+ hours easily... and still have flavor the whole time.  The flavor is a little strange but it grows on you.  I always keep a pack in my car for long drives.  Gum can hurt my jaw after a while but these sticks satisfy my oral fixation without causing my jaw to lock up.  The box says they can help smokers quit... and I believe it.  ...though I would recommend shopping around... a little pricey on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was on an atv ride when a friend busted these out during a break. I thought to myself, what a great idea to conquer the oral fixation when trying to quit smoking. I went and bought several packs for myself and my husband to use while we battle our addictions to quit smoking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent non-smoker, so I&#x27;ll spare you all the \\&quot;gospel\\&quot; that my counterparts generally spout, and simply say these are a great fix for anyone trying to quit.    I&#x27;ve been off cigarettes for 6 weeks now, and I carry a little container of these with me to take the edge off, and it&#x27;s great. They don&#x27;t splinter like other toothpicks, the tate is fine, and best of all, there&#x27;s no calories.</li>
            <li> These things helped me kick a 10 year smoking habit. It&#x27;s been another 10 years since then, and i&#x27;ve never gone back.</li>
            <li> Has a unique flavor.  Not my favorite, but its ok.  The sticks themselves are strong and clean cut.</li>
            <li> The tea tree toothpicks are outstanding, and both the tea tree and cinnamon are made with birchwood and natural oils/extracts. Nothing artificial. Both taste amazing, but for some reason, the tea tree ones hold up better to \\&quot;chewing\\&quot;...the cinnamon ones tend to splinter quite a bit finer than the tea tree, which can fill your mouth with mess.     I re-ordered 600 of the tea tree...they are that good, and are a broad spectrum antiseptic. Breath is amazing...ask my wife ;)</li>
            <li> I really love these sticks.  I quit smoking a year ago and with the help of these I haven&#x27;t touched a cigarette since.  I chew these everyday, going through about 200(1 pack) in two months.  Considering the price of smokes these are a crazy good alternative, and worth giving them a shot.</li>
            <li> My husband used these to quit smoking and they worked very well. They have a good flavor and last a long time and the price was great!</li>
            <li> JUST BE CAREFUL, DON&#x27;T CHAIN CHEW AND SWALLOW THE OIL. I had these for 3(?) days, and I was chain chewing them the whole time, swallowing the oil. THE LABEL COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC BECAUSE I FIGURED WHO THE HECK WOULD SWALLOW A TOOTHPICK. Those 3 days put me into a trance in which I was forgetting my life as it was happening to me. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was 3 days or 3 weeks. I was at work, and we were setting up stage risers for some anime convention. I said to my boss, &amp;#34;You know how people&#x27;s minds are like glass prisms, like they receive all this sensory information and project it back out as a focused stream of perception? Sometimes I feel like I receive all that sensory information and it just gets sent right back out, unchanged.&amp;#34; Right after that I went to fold out a piece of stage, and the entire 400-500lb slab of metal fell back and landed on my ankle. Opposite side of the Achilles tendon. I got matched with a girl on Tinder and I think I&#x27;m falling deeply &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; with her. It&#x27;s just an illusion right? Does anybody have experience with this!? We went to the same high school and I guess we always fantasized about each other from afar?? After the incident, while texting this young woman, I went into a realm of manic-depressive psychosis that led me to believe I was both the anti-christ and christ reborn. I wanted to take a sleeping bag to the highway. Then I looked up the tea tree oil.. CAUSES CONFUSION!!!!!!! Maybe I&#x27;m a one toothpick queer but I feel reborn. My leg is in a cast btw. I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s fault it was though so I&#x27;m not suing anybody. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to describe these.  The cinnamon are the best ever.  The other ones are gross.  But it helped me quit smoking.</li>
            <li> They leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth. Strong toothpicks tho....they last a while. I just dont like the aftertaste....good value tho as you get alot for the money.</li>
            <li> I got these to help me with quitting smoking and they worked great.  The flavor lasts forever.  May try them in some baking project as soon as I learn to bake.</li>
            <li> Great toothpicks. Really help freshen breath and they&#x27;re just fun to chew. The Cinnamon flavored one took some getting used to, as it has a nice sting to it. They&#x27;re my prefered flavor now though.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice.It is not overly huge in the package witch is a good thing so you can carry it in you pocket.The tea tree oil just tastes very minty.On the other hand the cinnamon tastes like its name. Im not saying that tea tree oil is horrible i just like the cinnamon more.They are both really strong so i would try them in little doses.All in all it was very good but i probobly wont bye them agin anytime soon because 200 picks last like 5 months for me.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the toothpicks. There was absolutely no cinnamon flavor at all. That was the main reason that I purchased the item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this two-pack they do. The cinnamon flavor sucks. Original is really good.</li>
            <li> Nice chewing sticks but they do not last long at all. Once they get wet they will start to break down quite quickly... good quality compared to others i have used though... the taste is strong and you can use the. To avoid smoking!</li>
            <li> They are incredibly strong. To the point where if I leave the cinnamon one in my mouth it feels as if acid is eating my lip. Other than that they are toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon are very strong but good for chewing and the tea tree flavor is kinda bland and more brittle not great for chewing.</li>
            <li> This is a great pack. I started off trying the cinnamon but they are pretty strong so I will only be using them every now and then. The original on the other hand has a great flavor to me. Both are perfect for those cravings you get or will get while quitting smoking (today is day 3 for me) I plan to keep a pack of each of these on hand at all times for as long as it takes.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised but the Tea Tree is very strong and is sometimes overpowering.  I soaked them in water for a little while to remove some of the oil and they&#x27;re a lot more bearable.</li>
            <li> pretty much too strong for my taste but may son seemed to like them. burned my lips and made them swell so may be a natural botox type thing for women...?</li>
            <li> ok - If you like chewing on something - Green tea not to minty, cin kinda hot but ok hope this helps</li>
            <li> They are just your average cheap toothpicks... after the first chew the toothpick instantly splinters... the flavor is poor and extremely strong...</li>
            <li> This product is great to help you quit smoking, helps to have something to put in your mouth. The flavors help a lot.</li>
            <li> I had these sent to my son to help to quit smoking and chewing.  He likes these the best.  Hasn&#x27;t quit yet though.</li>
            <li> Its a lot like gum. Something to do, freshens your breath, cleans your teeth, but better in almost all ways. You can focus on it more if you need or want to, you can use it to pick at your teeth and clean your gums, the mouth feel is amazing with the coolness of the tea tree or the heat of the cinnamon, the intensity of the flavor makes you be deliberate about not just smashing it up in your mouth, and its easy to store them in your pocket with getting smashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the tea tree to the cinnamon, as the cinnamon is slightly more intense, but isn&#x27;t as lasting. I love the cooling feeling of breathing in with the tea tree.</li>
            <li> Great price for a good brand of picks.  Out of all the flavored toothpick brands, these are the best.  They helped me quite smoking too!</li>
            <li> awesome - helped with quitting bad habits</li>
            <li> Bought these for my bf to help him get over his smoking habit. Strong flavor. He loves them!</li>
            <li> Although the seller only sent me cinnamon - I&#x27;ve used the Original a lot so I know what they taste like.  These are the only toothpicks I can use.  They have great flavor and work better than regular toothpicks to me.</li>
            <li> These chewing sticks (toothpicks) have been a great way for me to drop some bad habits like chewing nails, straws, or tobacco. The cinnamon flavor do have some real kick and most people I let try them are surprised at the intense flavor. That being said, the strong flavor does make your breath smell good and because it is antiseptic they do clean your mouth while you chew them. These are the only flavored toothpicks I prefer and they last a surprisingly long time. Can&#x27;t leave home without &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Recently tried to quit smoking and wanted to add an additional back up to my new smoke   free lifestyle. 1st the cinnamon sticks smell great &amp; keeps your mouth fresh, but they   taste strong ass heck and I always almost burn my mouth. It&#x27;s almost like chewing a whole pack of Big Red bubble gum!! Once you get past the initial burn everything else is A ok.</li>
            <li> Quit cold turkey thanks to these. The cinnamon flavor didn&#x27;t do it for me but I loved the tea tree flavor and was never a menthol smoker. Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> This product has helped a lot. I am using it for my smoking habit. So far so good. Thank you for marketing a easy to use item.</li>
            <li> These have been a good investment.  I got them for a friend of mine and he told me that he uses them and the grip it has does really give you some of the motion you would use when handling a cigerrete they felt the cinnamon was a little hot but liked the tea one.  In fact he gave some of them to a friend of his so that should say something about this product</li>
            <li> After trying both sticks, I have to ask.  What is all the fuss about?  Many have raved on here how the sticks hold up to chewing.  I did not have that experience at all and as a matter of fact, the sticks held up no differently and began to splinter in my mouth just like all of the other sticks I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree flavor took some getting used to and I can now live with it.  It definitely makes your mouth tingle and almost feel numb.  I was extremely disappointed in the cinnamon.  The reviews here raved at how strong it was and how they could barely keep it in their mouth.  I had no problems like that.  The only problem I had was detecting ANY cinnamon flavor at all through the other flavor profile that was on it.  This cinnamon was very weak and is probably attributable to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cinnamon, like a cinnamon stick flavoring.  I&#x27;m a hard core cinnamon fan (used to make my own sticks with cinnamon oil) and based on what I tasted here, I prefer the artificial cinnamon I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I&#x27;m disappointed in the purchase and the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> These things are so useful it&#x27;s almost ridiculous to me that I didn&#x27;t start buying them two years ago when I first heard of them. I was a smoker for 5 years and since I bought these a few months ago they&#x27;ve helped me tremendously in kicking the habit. If that&#x27;s not your reason just chew on them to keep your mouth fresh and to clean your teeth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I sometimes have a habit of getting all fidgety in class and while I&#x27;m doing things around the house, and I also tend to eat more than I should (thanks America). These things are a great tasting counter habit that I&#x27;ve grown to love. I should note that they aren&#x27;t an appetite suppressant, nor do they really do THAT much for your dental health (asked my very qualified dentist about them, he said they&#x27;re about as helpful for your teeth as unplugging your phone charger is for your electric bill).&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I love em, highly recommend em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A note about the cinnamon toothpicks - They use actual cinnamon oil, and therefore have some spiciness for first time users. you definitely get used to it though.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews that I read raved about the original and slammed the cinnamon-flavored pack.  I bought this one because it had both (one review suggested purchasing this one).  The reviews about the cinnamon are correct.  It barely tastes like cinnamon &amp; the flavor (whatever it is) only lasts for a couple of minutes.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy those again.  The reviews about the original flavor are completely wrong.  They are gross.  Yes, it lasts for a long time - but if it tastes weird, that makes it a bad thing.  They taste fishy/spicy/oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love these toothpicks, very flavorful, don&#x27;t break or splinter to easy. I buy these consistantly.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, I choose these flavored toothpicks and I am happy enough I did. Although I have no complaints, I feel that the price is a little high. I suppose I was expecting larger toothpicks, these are the size of general toothpicks. This works to my favor, as they are discreet and, for the fiend, the entire toothpick fits between clamped teeth for every bit of wood soaked flavor. They are quality, but c&#x27;mon we&#x27;re talking about wooden splinters here. It isn&#x27;t that the cinnamon picks are soft, but that the mint picks are so much harder. They are not candy, the flavor builds to an intensity, it is not an immediate sensation. However, once at its peak, the flavor is acutely strong.</li>
            <li> Good taste initially but then turns to a straight chemical bitterness. Leaves you with a terrible aftertaste</li>
            <li> These &#x27;chewing&#x27; sticks (tooth picks) are amazing! They also relieve heartburn and indigestion.</li>
            <li> The regular sticks are fine.  The blunt end prevents damage to the tongue.  However, the cinnamon version (which I didn&#x27;t order but which was shipped) caused a reaction, probably an allergy. These are a lot better to use than regular tooth picks and are good for smoking cessation.</li>
            <li> Great chew sticks. Keep their flavor for a long time</li>
            <li> Great product. Distracted me well when I was quitting smoking.&lt;br /&gt;The original flavor is great. The cinnamon literally burned my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;Still recommend this two-pack though, because you get to try &#x27;em both for a good price.</li>
            <li> I got these because regular toothpicks you buy at the food store usually give me a sore throat, apparently it&#x27;s the wood glue. These are great for taking your mind off smoking and food. Yes I use toothpicks to curve my appetite, it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;The flavors are good, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too strong as others have said. The cinnamon isn&#x27;t stronger than big red, actually it&#x27;s about the same.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t know buying these is that they are spear-pointed on one end and the other is flat with a notch, like a totem pole. Both are good for chewing and both sides have flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the plastic containers they come in are good for your pocket. I probably won&#x27;t even use the metal holder I bought separately.</li>
            <li> I like these, never bought them before. I smoke and they r a great hold over. They make ur mouth feel clean!! I was shocked. Makes u not want to smoke cause u don&#x27;t want that clean feeling to go away. Was here within 48hrs.</li>
            <li> If your trying to quit smoking then these are the trick to use with the Nicoderm CQ patch.  The tea tree oils and the menthol helps take away the cravings.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon is really spicy and nice. Leaves the breath tasting nice and fresh. I definitely recommend this for a midday fresher upper.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fancy toothpick, look no further.  If you are looking for chew sticks, look elsewhere.  These are literally flavored toothpicks, you cannot \\&quot;chew\\&quot; on them as they will break up like toothpicks very easily.  I sampled one of the cinnamon and I will be throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> I thought I could actually chew on these sticks for a long time but found them to be just as weak as a plain toothpick. The flavor is a good plus, but they arent as strong for chewing as I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2-pack of 1-Tea Tree, 1-Cinnamon pack. The package I received contained 2-Cinnamon packs and was clearly stated on the packaging that they were both cinnamon. I have no problem with this because I would prefer the cinnamon. The cinnamon still has tea tree on it and I would prefer that it had no tea tree at all. Other reviews have stated that the tea tree oil/scent leaves a funny aftertaste. I would say rather that the tea tree is an alternate taste after the brunt of the cinnamon starts to dissipate some, which takes quite a long time. Tea tree oil is supposed to have some antiseptic properties but I&#x27;m not fond of the taste of it - a musty, medicinal scent/taste. It&#x27;s really not that bothersome though because the cinnamon is so powerful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for toothpicks with the engraved ends because i like the look as well as some that had some flavor to them. These ones fulfilled both these needs in one simple product. The cinnamon flavor is great and has a little spice to it (which i like) and the tea tree oil lasts for hours and makes your breath very fresh and clean feeling. I love to chew on a toothpick and these are absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Put them in the fridge and it seemed as if the flavor and the durability lasted longer.  I also kept one pack in the car and withe the heat the stick fell apart real quick.</li>
            <li> great taste but they hurt the lips after a while.,</li>
            <li> Bought these here because I can&#x27;t find them locally anymore. Use one for good breath and to keep me from snacking on food all day. These are chewing sticks and while they have pointed ends they aren&#x27;t that sharp not great as tooth picks. Some my find the taste a little strong, but thats what I like about them :)</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth picks. They taste well, and hold up for a long time. I like having a point on only one end. I will be buying more of each flavor soon!!</li>
            <li> My husband is an avid tooth pick chewer. He loves these. It takes them a long time to be chewed threw. and they taste good!</li>
            <li> Great product. The Original Tea Tree is best described as a bitter mint and it lasts a tremendously long time. Very strong flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon tastes sweeter to me, but doesn&#x27;t last as long. I perfer the Original. I got about 6 hours out of one of them. Fun to chew and suck, and keeps my breath fresh to death. Makes the mouth feel clean. Be warned though, it will chap your lips if you keep it in for that long. Also, people won&#x27;t stop asking for them so I run out super quick. These things are the bomb. Buy them if you&#x27;re hesitating.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I used to chew them as a kid. I tried Hotlix recently and reminisced about how much nicer these were. I have to say Hotlix have a much stronger cinnamon flavor. These are made from better wood so that does allow for longer chewing, though the flavor is not nearly as strong and I find myself replacing my pick very quickly. The menthol flavor is not for me, it tastes too much like wood with a slight hint of cool. Try it the price is great and you get a ton, but keep these tips in mind.</li>
            <li> I like them and would recommend them to anyone that like flavored tooth picks. The tea tree sticks hold up longer than the cinnamon. but I like them both.</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth picks.  I prefer the cinnamon ones by far, but went through the all none the less.  The Plain Tea Tree oil ones take some getting used to.  The cinnamon ones will burn your lips if your not careful (I dozed off with one in the corner of my lips and boy did I regret it!).  They are like putting a pack of Big Red Gum in your mouth all at once (which is awesome).  They definitely help cut back on smoking as well.  Great Purchase!  Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying these. Like many of the other reviewers I have also quit smoking and am trying all kinds of things to distract myself, these are great! They were shipped super fast and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> So I love these, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend using them unless you&#x27;re trying to break a habit. Tea Treasure Oil (used in the toothpicks) isn&#x27;t a chemical that&#x27;s meant to be ingested. But the quantity is so small I doubt that it&#x27;s bad. So I say get em! Good price, and they taste darn good.</li>
            <li> The toothpicks arent as great as I thought they would be.  They chip easy and the flavor is not as good as another prodcut I use.</li>
            <li> I used these to stop smoking and they work great.</li>
            <li> They were okay but they kept breaking in my month. The flavor was decent. They need to be a tad more stronger.</li>
            <li> These chewing sticks are nice to have around. The plastic box they are stored is easily refillable, and compact enough to carry anywhere. Prefer the cinnamon which has great flavor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves how strong the flavor is. He can&#x27;t seem to get enough of them!</li>
            <li> Best toothpick on the market.  Love the easy to close lid.  Keeps them safe in my purse.  Cinnamon is a nice flavor.</li>
            <li> Funky taste; I like them.</li>
            <li> I love these flavored Tea Tree Chewing sticks. I would recommend them to anyone who may need to chew on something. Gum works. But only for a while. These are a good alternative to gum, smoking (if you do), chewing on fingernails, dirt or any other thing that you may put into your mouth!</li>
            <li> These chewing sticks are great.....plenty of flavor that lasts.  Cinnamon sticks are REALLY good the Original peppermint flavor is not quite as fresh.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon ones are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love these! Honestly, the original flavor is really strong and something I only use on occasion when my breath is not great. However, the cinnamon ones are fantastic. I will warn you that the cinnamon ones are also very strong (think &amp;#34;hotter than Red Hots&amp;#34; strong) but very good if you&#x27;re okay with that. These hold up to about 10 minutes of chewing for me.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the taste. It wasn&#x27;t pleasant. I was expecting a more palatable tasting tooth pick. Cinnamon was ok. The tree oil was the one that didn&#x27;t taste that good</li>
            <li> Breath mints and floss in one! It&#x27;s a great smoking cessation product because it satisfies one&#x27;s oral fixation.</li>
            <li> First time I purchase.....ok wait. First off. These helped me stop smoking. I needed an oral fixation. I tried twizzlers and red vines but of course that&#x27;s not good for your teeth but it helps though. The gums and mints out there with nicotine or even just regular gum did nothing for me. But these helped me stop. Only problem, the sticks are thinner now so they break easier in my mouth. I hate it. The first time I purchased I had thicker sticks so I could gnaw gnaw nom nom them but these thinner ones would break in my mouth sometimes when I first put them in. Idk about other smokers trying to kick the habit but the stress and being tense is something you may go through and thin toothpicks are not the business. But even after all that, I still prefer this brand over ALL the other chewing sticks out there. Both flavor a I love 100%. But it&#x27;s missing one star just for the thinner picks. I remember reading someone else who said they&#x27;d gladly pay a little more for the thicker sticks to come back, I agree. It&#x27;s a big difference. From Immediately breaking or chipping off pieces in your mouth ton being able to gnaw gnaw nom nom stress relief and still have a complete pick in your mouth that isn&#x27;t in shreds.</li>
            <li> The regular one starts minty but then there is an odd after taste...not extremely pleasant...cinnamon is pretty good though! I would buy again but I can get the same thing at the local feel rite and not have to pay shipping...</li>
            <li> I bought these to help me quit smoking and I am 42 days in now! These chew sticks have so much flavor and last a long time, and I still have plenty. My co-worker chews them when she is hungry and it has helped her from snacking to much as well.. We love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these on recommendation from people who used them to help them when they quit smoking.  Nice flavors and does give me that &amp;#34;Bite&amp;#34; I am missing by not smoking.  I carry a few around with me when I get the urge and to also use as toothpicks after a meal!</li>
            <li> These are the best!  It helped me stop smoking before.  I made the mistake of not keeping them around and started smoking again.  I just picked them up so I can quit and will always keep them with me.  They are also great for your teeth and breath!</li>
