            <li>Love this !</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li>I love this comb!...</li>
            <li>The fine teeth are great for separating lashes and removing excess mascara.</li>
            <li>The teeth are too strong for lashes and you run the risk of pulling them out (extensions AND your own lashes)</li>
            <li>it was suggest that this would be a better item to separate the eyelashes...still trying to to get the hang of it without poking myself in the eye</li>
            <li>I wanted an eyelash comb that would be able to be sanitized.</li>
            <li>Lovely steel comb that separates even the shortest lashes like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than a plastic comb.</li>
            <li>Got out my magnifying glass to make sure this lash comb was made with pins, not plastic or flattened pins.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t find them any more.</li>
            <li>Gets all the clumps out and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean off residual mascara, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>and I just rinse it off immediately so it stays clean and clump free.</li>
            <li>This eyelash brush works very good, its a little longer</li>
            <li>Other wise I love it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this item, since it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this new approach to applying mascara!</li>
            <li>This is an absolute MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li>... it does a good job untangling them if you use it carefully.</li>
            <li>Possibly a teeny tiny more space between teeth would be good</li>
            <li>Really makes my lashes stand out!</li>
            <li>Really made my lashes thicker and a lot longer!</li>
            <li>I have only been able to find lash combs that are plastic</li>
            <li>I always thought they should make a metal on so the teeth can actually  separate your lashes and not just clump them more.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this good qualilty instrument is no longer available at this price according to Amazon!</li>
            <li>love it but wish the handle was shorter- too long to keep in a makeup bag</li>
            <li>Nothing much to rate.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>it is a very sturdy eyelash comb, really quality made, look forward to using this tool for years to come.</li>
            <li>I really like this comb.</li>
            <li>but I have to admit that I have not used it much.</li>
            <li>it is what I expected and I am pleased</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Luckily the end of the long, long handle was safely rounded so</li>
            <li>I recommend cleaning it after each use to keep it working at high efficiency.</li>
            <li>but I had an old metal eyelash comb that was ready for the garbage.  </li>
            <li>It still separates but the teeth are just as far apart as the drug store brand.  </li>
            <li>I use this lash comb frequently to remove clumps from mascara and separate the lashes.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but not much better than other products I&#x27;ve used that are similar.</li>
            <li>WAs as expected but haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>so if your shaky or new to putting on makeup, this is probably not the right tool for you.</li>

            <li> love it but wish the handle was shorter- too long to keep in a makeup bag</li>
            <li> it was suggest that this would be a better item to separate the eyelashes...still trying to to get the hang of it without poking myself in the eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an eyelash comb. Nothing much to rate. Took a while to get. I would have gone elsewhere for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Love this new approach to applying mascara! Really makes my lashes stand out! Highly recommend!  Really made my lashes thicker and a lot longer!</li>
            <li> I wanted an eyelash comb that would be able to be sanitized. This one is made of metal and plastic. The fine teeth are great for separating lashes and removing excess mascara. I recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Got this after watching a Wayne Goss tutorial on Youtube!  It works perfectly, and a good price!</li>
            <li> Love this ! Seperates every lash. Removes clumps.</li>
            <li> it is a very sturdy eyelash comb, really quality made, look forward to using this tool for years to come.</li>
            <li> Helps me keep the clumps off my lashes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought it.  It looked like there was a row of shorter teeth in the comb and I thought, oh boy, this will catch any clumps, even if there are tiny ones, that are making my lashes stick together.  No so.  Sorry, but the picture is deceiving.  There is only one row of teeth.  It still separates but the teeth are just as far apart as the drug store brand.  I won&#x27;t return but will definitely buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This eyelash brush works very good, its a little longer then I thought it would be but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li> The seller was prompt and the item is good it will help lasher get longer put mascara on  tip of comb and comb threw your lashes it will help but be carefull not to hit your eye price was good..</li>
            <li> I really like this comb.</li>

            <li> it is what I expected and I am pleased</li>
            <li> The eyelash comb is terrific. It has  a long handle so it&#x27;s easy to use and the teeth are perfectly aligned so as to separate the lashes,</li>
            <li> WAs as expected but haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> I use this lash comb frequently to remove clumps from mascara and separate the lashes. It works very well and I just rinse it off immediately so it stays clean and clump free.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes separate even with mascara. Would buy it again and have recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> Perfect for separating lashes with mascara on them.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute MUST HAVE!! I have only been able to find lash combs that are plastic and they simply don&#x27;t work.  I always thought they should make a metal on so the teeth can actually  separate your lashes and not just clump them more. I recommend cleaning it after each use to keep it working at high efficiency. Just be careful I think there is a reason there not sold in stores its sharp metal by your EYE so if your shaky or new to putting on makeup, this is probably not the right tool for you.</li>
            <li> Lovely steel comb that separates even the shortest lashes like mine. It has an excessively long handle -- length of comb and handle is nearly 8 inches -- which might not fit into all cosmetic bags. Unfortunately, this good qualilty instrument is no longer available at this price according to Amazon!</li>
            <li> i wish the teeth were closer, but it does its job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than a plastic comb. Gets all the clumps out and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this comb!...It took a while to get here (3wks) but I had an old metal eyelash comb that was ready for the garbage.  Its use is for after putting on mascara to make lashes feathery instead of clumped up with mascara.  I get compliments all the time. Makes lashes look like false ones...I would never be without it! The plastic combs do not work.</li>
            <li> The neck is very weak and I&#x27;m afraid it may break. Other wise I love it. Possibly a teeny tiny more space between teeth would be good</li>
            <li> Best eyelash comb out there. You always want to get one that has metal as the comb and not plastic. Easy to clean off residual mascara, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this item, since it had such good reviews. It is a good product, but not much better than other products I&#x27;ve used that are similar.</li>
            <li> The handle is too long and it makes it difficult to use.  Would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Got out my magnifying glass to make sure this lash comb was made with pins, not plastic or flattened pins. So, it looked like what I wanted, similar to what I had purchased in the past at stores. They must have been deemed too dangerous for women to use so I can&#x27;t find them any more. Anyway, I thought I found one. Alas, these are made with a line of pins, but the points have apparently been cut off. Luckily the end of the long, long handle was safely rounded so I couldn&#x27;t stab myself !</li>
