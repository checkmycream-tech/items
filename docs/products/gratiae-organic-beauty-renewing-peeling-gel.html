            <li>Very good product for a much better price then here in Belgium</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and loved it too, so bought some for her for a gift.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it available at Amazon for a fraction of the cost at the kiosks.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>If your like me you&#x27;ll love it and make it part of your routine!</li>
            <li>and i am really glad I was able to find it online at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>BETTER PRICE ON AMAZON</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed more being removed in areas where I had more excess or flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product line and the price.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the product by a sales person at the kiosk in our local mall and loved the product but not the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to keep your skin healthy and this is such an easy way to remove dead skin and on top of all being said the product is organic and works!</li>
            <li>This product came in original packaging and was exactly like my sample from the mall.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft afterwards and my moisturizer is absorbed so much better immediately after I use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at the inflated price of $160 a couple of years ago and it was a much better consistency~removed easily, left the skin wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>Found in lotions and creams).&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the FDA also recommends Monsanto GMOs, maybe better to double analyse its recommendations.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and being able to peel so gently once a week really helps your skin.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy it at the time and decided to check  online first</li>
            <li>It removes old skin cells making your skin look very fresh.  </li>
            <li>I bought this first for myself and have loved how it cleanses my face and is also gradually getting rid of some pesky age-related skin tags (or bumps, not sure what you call them).  </li>
            <li>I started using ones a week after seeing how much death skin came out from my face, I decided to do twice now.</li>
            <li>After you use it your face is brand new.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I first purchased this at one of those rip-off kiosks at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the one very expensive chemical peel I had, this renewing peeling gel is far more effective and gentler, removing only dead skin cells instead of the entire top layer of the epidermis.</li>
            <li>It has been keeping my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Terrific gentle exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>soo helpful to remove dead cells and keep face sky clean</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Total rip-off and contains dangerous chemical ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly enough</li>

            <li> I am addicted to this product.  </li>
            <li> and I bought the peeling for 70 EUR, which seems still fairly exaggerated compared to the prices shown on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;Worse than that</li>
            <li> , I let myself being convinced to buy this terrible product in one of the Gratiae shops located in Maastricht (Netherlands).</li>
            <li> but once I used it for my skin, I had a terrible allergic reaction, which lasted for a couple of days!&lt;br /&gt;After discussion, the seller offered me a rebate</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  My face feels so soft afterwards and my moisturizer is absorbed so much better immediately after I use it.</li>
            <li> Total rip-off and contains dangerous chemical ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly enough, I let myself being convinced to buy this terrible product in one of the Gratiae shops located in Maastricht (Netherlands). Not only the seller tried to crook me by asking me an initial price of 140 EUR (ca. 160 USD), but once I used it for my skin, I had a terrible allergic reaction, which lasted for a couple of days!&lt;br /&gt;After discussion, the seller offered me a rebate and I bought the peeling for 70 EUR, which seems still fairly exaggerated compared to the prices shown on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;Worse than that, this peeling contains dimethicone,  a silicon-based polymer. (definition: a silicone emollient, which coats the skin not allowing toxins out. May promote tumors and accumulate in the liver and lymph nodes. Found in lotions and creams).&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the FDA also recommends Monsanto GMOs, maybe better to double analyse its recommendations.</li>
            <li> This stuff is smazzzzing!!!! I love it</li>
            <li> SHE LOVED IT!!!! BETTER PRICE ON AMAZON THEN IN THE MALL</li>
            <li> Great product great Amazon.com price.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great peel. I have sensitive acne prone skin and being able to peel so gently once a week really helps your skin. This product came in original packaging and was exactly like my sample from the mall. I would recommend this to anyone it&#x27;s good to keep your skin healthy and this is such an easy way to remove dead skin and on top of all being said the product is organic and works! but don&#x27;t forget everyone reacts and has different skin types that react different. My acne combination skin type needs this product! If your like me you&#x27;ll love it and make it part of your routine!</li>
            <li> Very good product for a much better price then here in Belgium</li>
            <li> I bought this first for myself and have loved how it cleanses my face and is also gradually getting rid of some pesky age-related skin tags (or bumps, not sure what you call them).  My daughter tried it and loved it too, so bought some for her for a gift.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It has been keeping my skin soft and clear. You have to try it. I am totally giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best exfoliating gel I have ever used. After you use it your face is brand new. Really great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It removes old skin cells making your skin look very fresh.  Like many others, I first purchased this at one of those rip-off kiosks at the mall.  I was very happy to find it available at Amazon for a fraction of the cost at the kiosks.</li>
            <li> Really takes off any excess layers of dead skin cells on your face! Compared to the one very expensive chemical peel I had, this renewing peeling gel is far more effective and gentler, removing only dead skin cells instead of the entire top layer of the epidermis. I noticed more being removed in areas where I had more excess or flaky skin. Would advise to use on neck and rest of decolletage.</li>
            <li> I love this product line and the price. I was introduced to the product by a sales person at the kiosk in our local mall and loved the product but not the price. I was reluctant to buy it at the time and decided to check  online first and i am really glad I was able to find it online at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is sticky and gritty on the skin. Hard to remove! I purchased it at the inflated price of $160 a couple of years ago and it was a much better consistency~removed easily, left the skin wonderfully smooth. What happened?</li>
            <li> soo helpful to remove dead cells and keep face sky clean</li>
            <li> Terrific gentle exfoliate.  Recommend one or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product.  I started using ones a week after seeing how much death skin came out from my face, I decided to do twice now. My skin looks radiant and my pores look a lot smaller. Best of all no death skin in my faceO:-)  i recomend itvbto anyone.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy Peter Thomas Roth peel.</li>
