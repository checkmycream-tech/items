            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy at all like most curl products.</li>
            <li>and I love this gel</li>
            <li>It has an okay smell, disregarding the chemical scent..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon as I don&#x27;t have access to a store that sells it.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>She thinks nothing works better than this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it more when I have no where to go to see if I can get my hair to do what it says it does</li>
            <li>so I kept it in a ponytail most of the time.</li>
            <li>love the way the product smells.</li>
            <li>Get so many compliments on my hair and how it smells.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>and my stylist says I have really healthy hair because of it.</li>
            <li>After trying many recommended products I&#x27;ve been using this for about a decade.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to find it on amazon at an even lower price.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product years ago.</li>
            <li>time, buy the real deal and get what it&lt;br /&gt; better!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s also not bad.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, frizzy, curly hair in need of a thick-textured but light feeling cream, this is it!</li>
            <li>This product is great for controlling curly hair and gives it a shiny, soft look, without leaving a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great for creating soft curls if you have wavy to curly hair.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply too much to get good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important not to use more than one pump of the product and to lightly finger comb it through your hair.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to the leave-in moisturizer, it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>but the smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m good with this product and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I use a pump and a half for the perfect curl.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that will frizz in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li>It makes my fine waves look perk up and look like they&#x27;ve been styled with a curling iron -- and</li>
            <li>My hair is more cowlicks than curls, but super frizzy - I&#x27;ve been told it looks \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; au naturale, but that&#x27;s not always the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>the best part is that there is little frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to always use gel.(I was always cheap).</li>
            <li>I have to go light in the summer or</li>
            <li>I always use this curl amplifier with its companion product, Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Booster, and have fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li>Not too soft though, which in Miami means at the end of the day you will look like Tina Turner, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>This is far superior.</li>
            <li>and I find it works best when my hair is still pretty wet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the search for several years for the perfect product to just scrunch, and blow dry with a diffuser - a nice 5-10 minute routine.  </li>
            <li>It is *very* easy to apply too much product.</li>
            <li>and I find that one pump of this stuff is usually the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>, that did a good job making my curls look nice, but not fantastic.</li>
            <li>ice been using this product specially for 9 years and wont ever use anything else.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s going right in the garbage for me!</li>
            <li>It took me forever to find the right product!</li>
            <li>but NOW I&#x27;m super excited to GET A</li>
            <li>This product is the best I have used for my long curly hair so far.</li>
            <li>that, which is usually in a bright blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product it really works.</li>
            <li>However, it gives your hair nice defined curls with scrunching and drying naturally or with a defuser.  </li>
            <li>I add more if I need to, or towel it out some if I have too much.</li>
            <li>So, I chose to begin using the TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock again last month and have never been happier as this product makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li>the Curlesque) version is pretty strong in a chemically sort of way.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a quick solution for air-drying and I will move on to something else.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price as this is more expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use drug store products before I spend any more money on this high end nonsense.</li>
            <li>One day my frizz seemed a bit better than normal,</li>
            <li>I am a caucasian with very curly hair which easily becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product after reading the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and have fine wavy to gentle curling hair.  </li>
            <li>it turns into a huge ball of frizz all over my head, its absolutely hideos.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair cream by far.  </li>
            <li>but I see the difference in my hair so its worth it.</li>
            <li>It controls the frizz and helps the curls take a more natural shape.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s sticky, but I find that this combats my super frizz.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>The product worked great for the first few months...</li>
            <li>Smells good, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, didn&#x27;t have to do a lot of work after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy even after blowing it dry, which is an amazing feat all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very reactive to moisture in the air and can get frizzy quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong fragances.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to get frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>you are here, you know curly hair products are pretty nuanced</li>
            <li>and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>: The first time I used this product I had crispy hair</li>
            <li>I have hair that is thick and wavy and this fells give it great texture and prevents frizzing.  </li>
            <li>I have trillion every product out there (almost) and this is the ONLY one I love and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>You really do rock!</li>
            <li>(By the way, I realize it might look funny that this posted under a man&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been following the Curly Girl (CG) hair method of not using any silicone or sulfate products on my hair for almost two years, and love how healthy my hair has gotten, especially as I&#x27;ve grown it out.  </li>
            <li>I then add the second pump, making sure that all the hair is coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and I can&#x27;t live without it, a professional hairdresser introduced it to me</li>
            <li>Only product I have liked so far for curly hair.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like my hair to feel crunchy, but this product pretty much gives you a choice</li>
            <li>I have 3Cish hair (a little bit of a mixture) and I am in love with this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have tight curls, and I don&#x27;t have super lose curls, but in between and tighter underneath, than on top.  </li>
            <li>I hope not, I have tried the Curlesque creme and it does work, but seems to dry my hair out more.</li>
            <li>Only reason it does not get 5 is the perfume..not strong after drying but still wish they would leave it out.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and this product has been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>The product also felt really sticky in my hands...like glue.</li>
            <li>as I&#x27;m looking through the reviews some people are dissatisfied and say that the product is really sticky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much of this product to cover my hair</li>
            <li>I just started using the product and my curls are so much softer.</li>
            <li>- it holds my curls really well all day.  </li>
            <li>The chemical scent in this is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li>But I had a whole bottle</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as wavy with some parts that are straighter than others with an intense halo cloud of frizzy hairs.</li>
            <li>This&lt;br /&gt;stuff is really sticky and gooey.</li>
            <li>I really like the Curls Rock, Curl Amplifier product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use too much bc</li>
            <li>It gives my curls so much definition.</li>
            <li>Was delivered in a timely manner, I really like this hair that helps style and give my hair body.  </li>
            <li>That should say so much already with my five star rating of this.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not too intense.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for curly hair, and you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li>intense curl keeper, but leaves hair a bit &#x27;crunchy&#x27;</li>
            <li>It tames the frizziness of my curls without too much control or stiffness.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any curly-haired girl!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take so much product to keep curls ruley.</li>
            <li>But I love the definitionit ggives without weight or too much shine and it gives a wet look</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t stiff or heavy and it defines my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li>I live in the South and haven&#x27;t tried it in the hot Summer/humidity</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a woman with slightly courser hair than mine really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I have huge curly hair - and I feel like this is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that gives me an entire day&#x27;s worth of hold.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have the time to mess with too many products.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Curls Rock on slightly damp hair, it gives my hair more separation, flow and</li>
            <li>Rock is 3x more $$ than my previous product, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying?</li>
            <li>I now have short hair and its super curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>said that this older version is better.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products that aim towards taming curly frizzy hair and this is the ONLY one that actually works!!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Only thing that keeps my curls under control WITHOUT getting crisp or crunchy!</li>
            <li>However it willmmaintain a natural looking style the whole time it&#x27;s in</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money for me because i have to use atleast 3 products to achive the same results this one does.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many curl creams that I just wasted money on...</li>
            <li>, if you are a fan of the wet look crunchy curls you can do that, or you evenly apply this and blow dry through it to give you nice curl and waves.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle and Florida where it is almost always humid or raining outright.</li>
            <li>I do not like the new product.</li>
            <li>The new Curlesque curl amplifier is the replacement.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if the people that had problems with the new product just needed to use 2 pumps instead of one?  </li>
            <li>I have curly locks and was in search of a new, improved product.  </li>
            <li>thought i would try something new but,</li>
            <li>I live in Miami.</li>
            <li>I heard somewhere that they were replacing this amplifier with the new line from TIGI.</li>
            <li>andyou need a  new application every day.  </li>
            <li>I do a quick dip under the shower head to set my curls in place, and flip my head over to scrunch with a cotton t-shirt, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for that old 80s wet look curls tho.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this, I used it all over after the Curls Rock leave-in conditioner of the same brand (recommended together on the packaging).  </li>
            <li>Doing it this way prevents the crunchy feel and it is soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have rather curly hair and are always trying new products to help our curls look non-frizzy and soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 and have naturally curly color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>curls with a natural,  soft bounce.</li>
            <li>While I do not have curly hair, it is very think and short.</li>
            <li>a soft messed up look.</li>
            <li>some frizz control as well as looking natural.</li>
            <li>The product lasts a pretty long time</li>
            <li>and when you wash it, its soft and you can feel the moisture from the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>I really like the second day hair, because instead of re-washing and fixing again, which is drying to my hair....</li>
            <li>This product offers thee hold</li>
            <li>When I say course, I mean that I&#x27;ve used many hair products in the &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(my hair is pretty dry and can soak up a lot of product).  </li>
            <li>It apparently is the only product that works very well with her type of hair.</li>
            <li>I use different curl enhancing shampoos throughout the week and once a week I use Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo once a week as part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li>When I do wash, it feels like you&#x27;re rinsing out conditioner when you first get your hair wet, so it feels like this product conditions, while promoting curls.  </li>
            <li>My wife recently bought the new Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy dry, not so curly, not so straight hair.</li>
            <li>from the most expensive to the cheapest and this stuff is the absolute best!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair in ringlets and no amount of humidity frizzes it...</li>
            <li>The new pump dispenses less than the last pump, which my wife likes, since the old pump seemed to give out too much anyways.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now and ran out for a month as I had been living outside the states, I was going crazy without it, it does a great job of helping to control frizz and make my hair easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Although my hair naturally curls into ringlets, they&#x27;re separated by vast amounts of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I am currently looking for a new replacement outside the Tigi line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth using, especially in comparison to other curl amplifying products I&#x27;ve used, but I would never use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Only tip I have to offer is make sure you only use a very small amount like the direction suggest.  </li>
            <li>;  takes care of my really curly hair by making it into soft bouncy tight ringlets.</li>
            <li>This is a great product just a little expensive.</li>
            <li>As some other reviewers have mentioned, using too much can make your hair crunchy and give you dandruff-like white fuzzies.  </li>
            <li>Willing to give it a shot again in a few months.</li>
            <li>I hate that it&#x27;s discontinued, and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do once the stock runs out, but I am very pleased with this product and my hair feels fabulous!</li>
            <li>I apply it right out of the shower on damp hair, then typically air dry and finish with a diffuser to add a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Curls</li>
            <li>I love this to help keep my hair looking good and it is difficult or impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li>I dilute with a little water as it is very sticky when you put it in your hand.  </li>

            <li> and I love this gel</li>
            <li> It has an okay smell, disregarding the chemical scent..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my favorite hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon as I don&#x27;t have access to a store that sells it.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it more when I have no where to go to see if I can get my hair to do what it says it does</li>
            <li> so I kept it in a ponytail most of the time.</li>
            <li> love the way the product smells.</li>
            <li> Get so many compliments on my hair and how it smells.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> and my stylist says I have really healthy hair because of it.</li>
            <li> After trying many recommended products I&#x27;ve been using this for about a decade.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to find it on amazon at an even lower price.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product years ago.</li>
            <li> time, buy the real deal and get what it&lt;br /&gt; better!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s also not bad.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, frizzy, curly hair in need of a thick-textured but light feeling cream, this is it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for controlling curly hair and gives it a shiny, soft look, without leaving a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for creating soft curls if you have wavy to curly hair.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply too much to get good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important not to use more than one pump of the product and to lightly finger comb it through your hair.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to the leave-in moisturizer, it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li> but the smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m good with this product and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I use a pump and a half for the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that will frizz in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li> It makes my fine waves look perk up and look like they&#x27;ve been styled with a curling iron -- and</li>
            <li> My hair is more cowlicks than curls, but super frizzy - I&#x27;ve been told it looks \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; au naturale, but that&#x27;s not always the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> the best part is that there is little frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to always use gel.(I was always cheap).</li>
            <li> I have to go light in the summer or</li>
            <li> I always use this curl amplifier with its companion product, Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Booster, and have fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft though, which in Miami means at the end of the day you will look like Tina Turner, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> This is far superior.</li>
            <li> and I find it works best when my hair is still pretty wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for several years for the perfect product to just scrunch, and blow dry with a diffuser - a nice 5-10 minute routine.  </li>
            <li> It is *very* easy to apply too much product.</li>
            <li> and I find that one pump of this stuff is usually the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li> , that did a good job making my curls look nice, but not fantastic.</li>
            <li> ice been using this product specially for 9 years and wont ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going right in the garbage for me!</li>
            <li> It took me forever to find the right product!</li>
            <li> but NOW I&#x27;m super excited to GET A</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used for my long curly hair so far.</li>
            <li> that, which is usually in a bright blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works.</li>
            <li> However, it gives your hair nice defined curls with scrunching and drying naturally or with a defuser.  </li>
            <li> I add more if I need to, or towel it out some if I have too much.</li>
            <li> So, I chose to begin using the TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock again last month and have never been happier as this product makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li> the Curlesque) version is pretty strong in a chemically sort of way.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick solution for air-drying and I will move on to something else.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price as this is more expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use drug store products before I spend any more money on this high end nonsense.</li>
            <li> One day my frizz seemed a bit better than normal,</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian with very curly hair which easily becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product after reading the positive reviews</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and have fine wavy to gentle curling hair.  </li>
            <li> it turns into a huge ball of frizz all over my head, its absolutely hideos.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair cream by far.  </li>
            <li> but I see the difference in my hair so its worth it.</li>
            <li> It controls the frizz and helps the curls take a more natural shape.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s sticky, but I find that this combats my super frizz.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> The product worked great for the first few months...</li>
            <li> Smells good, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, didn&#x27;t have to do a lot of work after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy even after blowing it dry, which is an amazing feat all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very reactive to moisture in the air and can get frizzy quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong fragances.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to get frizzy easily.</li>
            <li> you are here, you know curly hair products are pretty nuanced</li>
            <li> and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> : The first time I used this product I had crispy hair</li>
            <li> I have hair that is thick and wavy and this fells give it great texture and prevents frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I have trillion every product out there (almost) and this is the ONLY one I love and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> You really do rock!</li>
            <li> (By the way, I realize it might look funny that this posted under a man&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following the Curly Girl (CG) hair method of not using any silicone or sulfate products on my hair for almost two years, and love how healthy my hair has gotten, especially as I&#x27;ve grown it out.  </li>
            <li> I then add the second pump, making sure that all the hair is coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and I can&#x27;t live without it, a professional hairdresser introduced it to me</li>
            <li> Only product I have liked so far for curly hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like my hair to feel crunchy, but this product pretty much gives you a choice</li>
            <li> I have 3Cish hair (a little bit of a mixture) and I am in love with this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have tight curls, and I don&#x27;t have super lose curls, but in between and tighter underneath, than on top.  </li>
            <li> I hope not, I have tried the Curlesque creme and it does work, but seems to dry my hair out more.</li>
            <li> Only reason it does not get 5 is the perfume..not strong after drying but still wish they would leave it out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and this product has been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> The product also felt really sticky in my hands...like glue.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m looking through the reviews some people are dissatisfied and say that the product is really sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of this product to cover my hair</li>
            <li> I just started using the product and my curls are so much softer.</li>
            <li> - it holds my curls really well all day.  </li>
            <li> The chemical scent in this is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> But I had a whole bottle</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as wavy with some parts that are straighter than others with an intense halo cloud of frizzy hairs.</li>
            <li> This&lt;br /&gt;stuff is really sticky and gooey.</li>
            <li> I really like the Curls Rock, Curl Amplifier product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use too much bc</li>
            <li> It gives my curls so much definition.</li>
            <li> Was delivered in a timely manner, I really like this hair that helps style and give my hair body.  </li>
            <li> That should say so much already with my five star rating of this.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not too intense.  </li>
            <li> It works really well for curly hair, and you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> intense curl keeper, but leaves hair a bit &#x27;crunchy&#x27;</li>
            <li> It tames the frizziness of my curls without too much control or stiffness.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any curly-haired girl!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take so much product to keep curls ruley.</li>
            <li> But I love the definitionit ggives without weight or too much shine and it gives a wet look</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t stiff or heavy and it defines my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li> I live in the South and haven&#x27;t tried it in the hot Summer/humidity</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a woman with slightly courser hair than mine really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I have huge curly hair - and I feel like this is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that gives me an entire day&#x27;s worth of hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the time to mess with too many products.  </li>
            <li> When I use the Curls Rock on slightly damp hair, it gives my hair more separation, flow and</li>
            <li> Rock is 3x more $$ than my previous product, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying?</li>
            <li> I now have short hair and its super curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> said that this older version is better.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products that aim towards taming curly frizzy hair and this is the ONLY one that actually works!!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my curls under control WITHOUT getting crisp or crunchy!</li>
            <li> However it willmmaintain a natural looking style the whole time it&#x27;s in</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money for me because i have to use atleast 3 products to achive the same results this one does.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many curl creams that I just wasted money on...</li>
            <li> , if you are a fan of the wet look crunchy curls you can do that, or you evenly apply this and blow dry through it to give you nice curl and waves.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle and Florida where it is almost always humid or raining outright.</li>
            <li> I do not like the new product.</li>
            <li> The new Curlesque curl amplifier is the replacement.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the people that had problems with the new product just needed to use 2 pumps instead of one?  </li>
            <li> I have curly locks and was in search of a new, improved product.  </li>
            <li> thought i would try something new but,</li>
            <li> I live in Miami.</li>
            <li> I heard somewhere that they were replacing this amplifier with the new line from TIGI.</li>
            <li> andyou need a  new application every day.  </li>
            <li> I do a quick dip under the shower head to set my curls in place, and flip my head over to scrunch with a cotton t-shirt, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for that old 80s wet look curls tho.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I used it all over after the Curls Rock leave-in conditioner of the same brand (recommended together on the packaging).  </li>
            <li> Doing it this way prevents the crunchy feel and it is soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have rather curly hair and are always trying new products to help our curls look non-frizzy and soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 and have naturally curly color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> curls with a natural,  soft bounce.</li>
            <li> While I do not have curly hair, it is very think and short.</li>
            <li> a soft messed up look.</li>
            <li> some frizz control as well as looking natural.</li>
            <li> The product lasts a pretty long time</li>
            <li> and when you wash it, its soft and you can feel the moisture from the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I really like the second day hair, because instead of re-washing and fixing again, which is drying to my hair....</li>
            <li> This product offers thee hold</li>
            <li> When I say course, I mean that I&#x27;ve used many hair products in the &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (my hair is pretty dry and can soak up a lot of product).  </li>
            <li> It apparently is the only product that works very well with her type of hair.</li>
            <li> I use different curl enhancing shampoos throughout the week and once a week I use Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo once a week as part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li> When I do wash, it feels like you&#x27;re rinsing out conditioner when you first get your hair wet, so it feels like this product conditions, while promoting curls.  </li>
            <li> My wife recently bought the new Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry, not so curly, not so straight hair.</li>
            <li> from the most expensive to the cheapest and this stuff is the absolute best!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair in ringlets and no amount of humidity frizzes it...</li>
            <li> The new pump dispenses less than the last pump, which my wife likes, since the old pump seemed to give out too much anyways.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and ran out for a month as I had been living outside the states, I was going crazy without it, it does a great job of helping to control frizz and make my hair easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Although my hair naturally curls into ringlets, they&#x27;re separated by vast amounts of frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am currently looking for a new replacement outside the Tigi line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth using, especially in comparison to other curl amplifying products I&#x27;ve used, but I would never use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Only tip I have to offer is make sure you only use a very small amount like the direction suggest.  </li>
            <li> ;  takes care of my really curly hair by making it into soft bouncy tight ringlets.</li>
            <li> This is a great product just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have mentioned, using too much can make your hair crunchy and give you dandruff-like white fuzzies.  </li>
            <li> Willing to give it a shot again in a few months.</li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s discontinued, and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do once the stock runs out, but I am very pleased with this product and my hair feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> I apply it right out of the shower on damp hair, then typically air dry and finish with a diffuser to add a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Curls</li>
            <li> I love this to help keep my hair looking good and it is difficult or impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I dilute with a little water as it is very sticky when you put it in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Only gets stiff if you use too much, otherwise you can&#x27;t tell that you have product in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky and thick but as long as it works, I don&#x27;t care :)</li>
            <li> I have long curls and this is one of the only products that keeps my hair looking descent for several days.</li>
            <li> I have fine (but thick) wavy-to-curly hair that starts out frizzy all over &amp; gets a little oily at the roots by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> however it only feels that way if you put it in your hair when your hair is dry</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this product in drugstores these days, so, thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> It is th ick and is hard to wash off of your hands and if you use too much it just globs.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (it&#x27;s between my shoulders and elbow).</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was confused because it looks completely different from the picture.</li>
            <li> section with some success; however, those products are occasionally too thick or heavy for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curlesque makes my hair straight and stiffer, it tangles easier, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on controlling  my thick underlayer.  </li>
            <li> My curls get sticky and stiff, and after a day or so fall apart completely.</li>
            <li> I used only a little bit of the product for the first time and it made my hair hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is these products are a little pricey, but for the results I get, I am willing to splurge.</li>
            <li> and I even have really long hair!).  </li>
            <li> This product makes your hair soft and if you use a little extra it makes it slightly crunchy but makes your hair stay in place like two days.</li>
            <li> If i dont dry it all the way it will frizz some but not like it would without Curls Rock amp.  </li>
            <li> then let it dry</li>
            <li> yes it will be sticky just like putting mousse in dry hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry crusty.</li>
            <li> I stop scrunching it when it&#x27;s almost dry, otherwise you start separating the curls.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you want dry curls.</li>
            <li> , I rub my hands together and push this cream through my hair and then flip my head upside-down and blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Although my hair has gotten healthier, I&#x27;ve still been battling with constant frizz, so I recently decided to add in a few silicone products.  </li>
            <li> I have dry loose curls.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, however I deducted a star because it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a curl styling product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or really weighed down.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely, hands down, the only product that I can use on my thick, sometimes frizzy, curly hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super greasy and thick - like crisco, - and just as hard to wash off your hands.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that usually handles product very well..</li>
            <li> It makes your hands very sticky and the product is very hard to get off even with scrubbing with soap.  </li>
            <li> It seems to go a bit further if you mix with a little bit of water on your hands too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have given many of those products away because they smell so bad.</li>
            <li> Note that it does become sticky if your hair gets wet after applying product, for example during aerobic exercise.</li>
            <li> i admit it leaves it wet looking</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly and frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a LOT of hair products to try to tame my mane, and this is the only one that has even remotely worked.  </li>
            <li> I always have a difficult time finding the right products</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that works for my long, thick, frizz prone hair, and in the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and even when only using 2 pumps of this product, I still get hard curls, which looks unnatural and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick hair but wear it in a short bob and it takes about 15 to twenty minutes to get it dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it again for the next few days using less product and without the conditioner step.  </li>
            <li> I can see this working well for someone with thick, coarse, or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I can see how this produce is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I doubt I would buy it again due to price and quantity.</li>
            <li> It is truly a cream (unlike other liquidy products that claim to be one).</li>
            <li> Any suggestions fro other reviewers?</li>
            <li> Other brand was no comparison to this.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even touch my hair without then washing my hands due to the stickiness.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> After purchasing it again and reading others reviews, I find it&#x27;s helpful to apply when my hair is very wet, and scrunching it as it dries...</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a product that would help my curls after I used a diffuser (before, I would use one with some random curl creme and an hour later, my hair would be completely frizzy)</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition every other day, if not more, and this holds my curls for that long.  </li>
            <li> It dried to a crunchy and &#x27;wet&#x27; look that I am not interested in.</li>
            <li> and I have bouncy waves that last for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So I need a product that will weigh down that frizz but also perk up the wave in my looser sections of hair.</li>
            <li> weighed hair down.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have this curly thing down yet.</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair, I flip it upside down in the shower, squeeze out some of the water, and then distribute one pump of this on my palms, using the wetness to coat my skin.  </li>
            <li> and i mean only product...</li>
            <li> One of the few products I have found for my extremely course curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has a slight hold which you can control after the product dries.</li>
            <li> I put less than a quarter size dollop in my hand</li>
            <li> I apply very little (a quarter of a pump) while my hair is still quite wet and work it through.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a stringy, sticky, crunchy MESS.</li>
            <li> Frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my curls tight all day.</li>
            <li> We diluted it with a little water added to it in the palm of our hands.</li>
            <li> All I need is two little squirts</li>
            <li> The secret is putting the product on when your hair is sopping wet and blowing dry with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years</li>
            <li> the next, it looked worse, which leads me to believe it didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I use their leave in conditioner from this line and some mousse along with this, then diffuse my hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s curls all day but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like it&#x27;s been gelled.  </li>
            <li> I want without my hair being stiff.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market to tame frizz and to keep my hair controlled into the style I want.  </li>
            <li> My wife tried about 10 products before Curls Rock to try and tame her frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick long curly hair and this product works wonders.  </li>
            <li> However, this curl cream soothes all this and for the first time ever, I can actually wear my hair down without feeling horribly embarrassed!  </li>
            <li> I bought this curl cream on the advice of my stylist who was shocked by the intense frizziness of my unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> but ANY amount of this stuff, no matter how small, leaves my hair looking sticky and feeling saturated in product.</li>
            <li> usually wash my hair with Paul Mitchell, rake my fingers through my hair to separate curls, put a 1/2 pump of this stuff in my hands, and run it through my curls.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product when I&#x27;m on the go, as the leave-in moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seal and gets all over the place if you try to take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> past shoulder length</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about the only thing I like about it.  </li>
            <li> it was the same&lt;br /&gt;thing only cheaper, and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I even tried adding a bit of water to the small amount before applying it to my hair, thinking it might soften the effect.</li>
            <li> hair is about three inches past my shoulders, and I use two pumps of this to cover my hair, followed by a bit of gel.  </li>
            <li> ;  This product is very thick, I have to put it in my hair while it&#x27;s still very wet to thin out the product and use less than I usually do</li>
            <li> It was very thick and weighed my hair down and made it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve narrowed down a technique that makes the product usable, but it still makes my curls a little weird, almost waxy.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever say that.  </li>
            <li> they sit in my drawer because they are too greasy, too crunchy, dull etc etc.  </li>
            <li> you have curls and thick hair or hair that is prone to frizz, you need to try this stuff out.  </li>
            <li> too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I had stopped using TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock for awhile and began using a less expensive curly hair product</li>
            <li> My misses has some serious curls and this product works well to get rid of frizz and pump up her curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with curl serums loaded with heavy silicones that made my hair weighed down and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and have used practically hundreds of hair products.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian with very thick and curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to ask to tough my air.</li>
            <li> that is a bad thing to do put the product in your hair when it&#x27;s wet out of the shower</li>
            <li> The sticky residue left in my hair is annoying.</li>
            <li> Even worse was when I was working out</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and looked dirty and greasy, like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 3 or 4 days.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and a lot of it!  </li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> alas, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> It smells really bad and that bothered me a lot.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after my go-to styling product (fructis garnier fiber gum putty) was discontinued :(.</li>
            <li> Horrible :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product as it leaves my hair sticky and feeling yuck!  </li>
            <li> Gel is terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product worked great for the first few months...then it seemed as though my hair built up a resistance to the product.  Willing to give it a shot again in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years and I absolutely love it!!  I have very thick long curly hair and this product works wonders.  It isn&#x27;t stiff or heavy and it defines my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li> My hair is more cowlicks than curls, but super frizzy - I&#x27;ve been told it looks \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; au naturale, but that&#x27;s not always the look I&#x27;m going for. One pump of this serum after getting out of the shower and I have bouncy waves that last for at least 8 hours. Plus, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with curly/wavy, course, dryish red hair.  When I say course, I mean that I&#x27;ve used many hair products in the &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; section with some success; however, those products are occasionally too thick or heavy for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best.  I have a hard time finding a curl styling product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or really weighed down.  I&#x27;ve narrowed down a technique that makes the product usable, but it still makes my curls a little weird, almost waxy.  If I wash my hair before bed, sometimes I will use this product because it will hold the curls through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;technique.&amp;#34;  This product is very thick, I have to put it in my hair while it&#x27;s still very wet to thin out the product and use less than I usually do (my hair is pretty dry and can soak up a lot of product).  As I said above, I usually only use this product before bed or if I know I&#x27;m going to put my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are here, you know curly hair products are pretty nuanced, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a woman with slightly courser hair than mine really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I love this this product. A friend of mine told me about it and so I went ahead and tried it. I just donated 14inches of my hair to locks of love! I now have short hair and its super curly and frizzy. This product keeps its curl and no frizz. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am 65 and have naturally curly color-treated hair. I live in Seattle and Florida where it is almost always humid or raining outright. My hair needs a lot of product... I slather this on washed hair,then cup and twirl and whatever with a diffuser dryer. I have thick hair but wear it in a short bob and it takes about 15 to twenty minutes to get it dry. If i dont dry it all the way it will frizz some but not like it would without Curls Rock amp.  Only reason it does not get 5 is the perfume..not strong after drying but still wish they would leave it out.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works.</li>
            <li> It holds well with my hair and keeps my curls in shape. best product for my curly hair to hold.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and a lot of it!  It is very reactive to moisture in the air and can get frizzy quickly.  THIS STUFF IS MAGIC!!!!  I have tried every product on the market to tame frizz and to keep my hair controlled into the style I want.  NOTHING WORKS LIKE THIS.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they discontinue this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curls and thick hair or hair that is prone to frizz, you need to try this stuff out.  it&#x27;s a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Good price for great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. I have thick, coarse hair that usually handles product very well.. but ANY amount of this stuff, no matter how small, leaves my hair looking sticky and feeling saturated in product. I experimented with different application techniques (scrunching it in v. combing it through) and different amounts of the product, but none of it made a difference. Save yourself the $20</li>
            <li> Read reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t crunchy on your hair...idk what they were talking about. I used only a little bit of the product for the first time and it made my hair hard and crunchy. The product also felt really sticky in my hands...like glue. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Idk...just don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re looking to enhance your waves/curls with a natural,  soft bounce.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I was very disappointed with this product as it leaves my hair sticky and feeling yuck!  have never had this problem before so I&#x27;m guessing ingredients have changed. I would not bother!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for my fie, natural curly hair.  I have bought over and over.</li>
            <li> This product works great for curly hair.... ice been using this product specially for 9 years and wont ever use anything else. as I&#x27;m looking through the reviews some people are dissatisfied and say that the product is really sticky. however it only feels that way if you put it in your hair when your hair is dry that is a bad thing to do put the product in your hair when it&#x27;s wet out of the shower then let it dry and you will get your results otherwise yes it will be sticky just like putting mousse in dry hair</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I can see how this produce is not for everyone.  I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and this product has been perfect for me.  It smooths frizz and keeps my curls bouncy.  It&#x27;s important not to use more than one pump of the product and to lightly finger comb it through your hair.  I don&#x27;t use much of this product to cover my hair and I find it works best when my hair is still pretty wet.  I use different curl enhancing shampoos throughout the week and once a week I use Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo once a week as part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair cream by far.  I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market, and this adds volume while keeping the frizz away.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I found that tames my curls in all weather and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product and my curls are so much softer. I used to always use gel.(I was always cheap). It is expensive but I see the difference in my hair so its worth it. My hair is super long and I think I will be going through one a month. I use a pump and a half for the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> Will use this forever.  Great for curls.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for my curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t dry crusty. this is all I use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and ran out for a month as I had been living outside the states, I was going crazy without it, it does a great job of helping to control frizz and make my hair easier to manage. It would take me forever to get the tangles out of my hair after washing it when I was not using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this curl cream on the advice of my stylist who was shocked by the intense frizziness of my unmanageable hair.  Although my hair naturally curls into ringlets, they&#x27;re separated by vast amounts of frizz.  However, this curl cream soothes all this and for the first time ever, I can actually wear my hair down without feeling horribly embarrassed!  As some other reviewers have mentioned, using too much can make your hair crunchy and give you dandruff-like white fuzzies.  But if you use about 1-1.5 pumps, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.  It also smells amazing!  I&#x27;ve bought a LOT of hair products to try to tame my mane, and this is the only one that has even remotely worked.  Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing. You don&#x27;t need to apply too much to get good results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tigi Catwalk&#x27;s Curls Rock #5 for many years and love it. While I do not have curly hair, it is very think and short. When I use the Curls Rock on slightly damp hair, it gives my hair more separation, flow and a soft messed up look. It is hard to find this product in drugstores these days, so, thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> my wife used to get this product from her local hairstylist, but it was discontinued from them. It apparently is the only product that works very well with her type of hair. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy! I do not like the new product. I will continue to look for all of them</li>
            <li> love this product. It&#x27;s a little expensive but it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my hair now. No need for mousse, gel, or similar products that make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. This will give you the softest curls!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and cheaper than in the stores. Great equity too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a curl cream to help give my hair some frizz control as well as looking natural. This stuff is legit! I was frustrated with curl serums loaded with heavy silicones that made my hair weighed down and greasy. This was recommended to me by a stylist, and it helps my curls (3A/3B) maintain their corkscrews without crispiness, greasiness, or frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair with Paul Mitchell, rake my fingers through my hair to separate curls, put a 1/2 pump of this stuff in my hands, and run it through my curls. I do a quick dip under the shower head to set my curls in place, and flip my head over to scrunch with a cotton t-shirt, and let it air dry. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and have fine wavy to gentle curling hair.  This made our hair curlier which we wanted.  I love the product, however I deducted a star because it is very expensive.  We diluted it with a little water added to it in the palm of our hands. It makes your hands very sticky and the product is very hard to get off even with scrubbing with soap.  However, it gives your hair nice defined curls with scrunching and drying naturally or with a defuser.  I doubt I would buy it again due to price and quantity.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy at all like most curl products. The smooth cr&amp;egrave;me makes for wonderful curls.</li>
            <li> I love this to help keep my hair looking good and it is difficult or impossible to find in the store.  I like to encourage the curl without going to a perm or using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have medium think wavy/curly hair (caucasian) and I love this gel - it holds my curls really well all day.  Note that it does become sticky if your hair gets wet after applying product, for example during aerobic exercise.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product when I&#x27;m on the go, as the leave-in moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seal and gets all over the place if you try to take it anywhere. The screw-on cap as well as the pump mechanism are great ways to prevent leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this controls frizz, but the qualms I have with this are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. The chemical scent in this is a bit much for me. In comparison to the leave-in moisturizer, it&#x27;s too strong. It has an okay smell, disregarding the chemical scent..&lt;br /&gt;2. The sticky residue left in my hair is annoying. I have very long hair, and even when only using 2 pumps of this product, I still get hard curls, which looks unnatural and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a temporary solution for on the go products, this is just alright. It&#x27;s worth using, especially in comparison to other curl amplifying products I&#x27;ve used, but I would never use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It helps my curly/wavy hair to hold curls without getting crunchy. The product lasts a pretty long time and I only need to use about two pumps for my almost shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair.  This product works wonders to reduce the frizz and allows my curls to set the way they should; without the frizz!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using this for years now and it&#x27;s my favorite hair product I have ever used. I have very thick curly hair and have used practically hundreds of hair products. This product makes your hair soft and if you use a little extra it makes it slightly crunchy but makes your hair stay in place like two days. Hope they never ever discontinue this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It holds the curls in my hair all day. I am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon as I don&#x27;t have access to a store that sells it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for controlling curly hair and gives it a shiny, soft look, without leaving a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture on my hair.</li>
            <li> the best hair product for curly hair</li>
            <li> Helps define my curls and I can freshen up my hairstyle by dampening my hair, but the product is water proof so it won&#x27;t rinse out with out copious amounts of rain or swimming. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I use one bottle every five to six months. My hair will like great all day even when the wind is gusting. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to ask to tough my air. Before I discovered this product, my curly hair was unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: The first time I used this product I had crispy hair and I thought I&#x27;d never buy it again. But I had a whole bottle and I discovered how to use it. I apply very little (a quarter of a pump) while my hair is still quite wet and work it through. After trial and error, I can now feel when I have the amount right. I add more if I need to, or towel it out some if I have too much. Then I wrap the curs around my finger and let them spring into place.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I can&#x27;t live without it, a professional hairdresser introduced it to me and since then I use it every day.  It defines my curls and makes them shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the product but I found it cheaper at my local target after I had already purchased it. Oh well still the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my curls.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is thick and wavy and this fells give it great texture and prevents frizzing.  Depending on how much I use I can get anywhere from curly to perfectly wavy hair.  Only gets stiff if you use too much, otherwise you can&#x27;t tell that you have product in your hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used for my long curly hair so far. It keeps my curls very beautiful and natural without any crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair. This is the best stuff I have ever used in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Use it on my husband and sons too.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This cream is the only thing that works for me. It&#x27;s not for all hair I&#x27;m sure. My hair contains all types of texture. I would describe it as wavy with some parts that are straighter than others with an intense halo cloud of frizzy hairs. So I need a product that will weigh down that frizz but also perk up the wave in my looser sections of hair. This product is the only thing that does that for me. It is truly a cream (unlike other liquidy products that claim to be one). At first it&#x27;s sticky, but I find that this combats my super frizz. It&#x27;s well worth the money for me because i have to use atleast 3 products to achive the same results this one does. It has a slight hold which you can control after the product dries. The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s also not bad. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Of the three top rated curly hair products I tried from Amazon, this one is the best. No frizz and it keeps my curls tight all day.</li>
            <li> To  customerservice@ tigihaircare.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that your Curls Rock product has stopped production.  The new Curlesque curl amplifier is the replacement.  I would like to complain that they are NOT the same. The &amp;#34;above Curls Rock&amp;#34;  takes care of my really curly hair by making it into soft bouncy tight ringlets. Your newer product  Curlesque makes my hair straight and stiffer, it tangles easier, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on controlling  my thick underlayer.  I am a Caucasian with very thick and curly past shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you would reconsider.  I am currently looking for a new replacement outside the Tigi line.  Any suggestions fro other reviewers?</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and uses it after shampooing. She says if you scrunch up your hair while it air dries, it keeps curls in without frizzing. So, there you go.</li>
            <li> I read some great reviews, so I gave this product a try. It smells really bad and that bothered me a lot. I assumed I would get used to the smell, but it never faded. It was very thick and weighed my hair down and made it look greasy. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fruity and great.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about the only thing I like about it.  It&#x27;s super greasy and thick - like crisco, - and just as hard to wash off your hands.  I have fine (but thick) wavy-to-curly hair that starts out frizzy all over &amp; gets a little oily at the roots by the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve been on the search for several years for the perfect product to just scrunch, and blow dry with a diffuser - a nice 5-10 minute routine.  The first day I used this, I used it all over after the Curls Rock leave-in conditioner of the same brand (recommended together on the packaging).  My hair was dull and looked dirty and greasy, like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 3 or 4 days.  I tried it again for the next few days using less product and without the conditioner step.  It still looked yucky.  One day my frizz seemed a bit better than normal, the next, it looked worse, which leads me to believe it didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  I can see this working well for someone with thick, coarse, or dry hair.  I will go back to my standby Frizz Ease mousse and keep searching.</li>
            <li> Product must be really good because my wife raves about it.</li>
            <li> I have always bought and likes TIGI curls rock.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this one and was thinking it is the same&lt;br /&gt;as that, which is usually in a bright blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I bought and tried this thinking it was the same&lt;br /&gt;thing only cheaper, and boy was I wrong. This&lt;br /&gt;stuff is really sticky and gooey. Don&#x27;t waste&lt;br /&gt;your time, buy the real deal and get what it&lt;br /&gt; better!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my curls were not defined and formless. I am very happy, because besides restore their shape, the hair is soft and smells delicious. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was confused because it looks completely different from the picture. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the same product because it&#x27;s the same name and brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like crack for people with curly hair, no kidding.</li>
            <li> My wife recently bought the new Curls Rock.  After reading some reviews, she was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to work as well, but was happy to fine it works great!  It seems to be the same product as before.  The new pump dispenses less than the last pump, which my wife likes, since the old pump seemed to give out too much anyways.  I wonder if the people that had problems with the new product just needed to use 2 pumps instead of one?  My wife tried about 10 products before Curls Rock to try and tame her frizzy hair.  She thinks nothing works better than this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I can&#x27;t find this in my area and I ran out so I used another brand. Other brand was no comparison to this. I will never substitute again!</li>
            <li> Bought from my local Target....Product works okay but the smell is too strong for me.  I am sensitive to strong fragances.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed!  I have curly locks and was in search of a new, improved product.  This was not it.  I&#x27;ll use drug store products before I spend any more money on this high end nonsense.</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of hair products before this and nothing worked.  My friend told me about Curls Rock and it worked perfectly!  My hair keeps it&#x27;s curls all day but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like it&#x27;s been gelled.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Curls Rock, Curl Amplifier product. I use it on \\&quot;2nd day hair\\&quot; to revive and lock in the curl. It takes all the frizz out. I call it \\&quot;the glue\\&quot; because it hardens in place but the results look great.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT RECEIVED ON TIME IN. JUST AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li> Works just great on my hair. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue but my daughter loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Too sticky for me to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It tames my curls without looking or feeling crunchy. And the price cannot be beat! I recomment this to anyone with any curl in their hair.</li>
            <li> too thick.  weighed hair down.  silicone containing.  yucky.  gonna stick with my deva curl products.  thought i would try something new but, alas, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy/curly hair and am always looking for the perfect after shower product. I read about this product on someone&#x27;s blog who raved about it but it&#x27;s going right in the garbage for me! I even tried adding a bit of water to the small amount before applying it to my hair, thinking it might soften the effect. It dried to a crunchy and &#x27;wet&#x27; look that I am not interested in. Next!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have long hair (it&#x27;s between my shoulders and elbow). I use about 1 to 1 1/2 pumps. Can&#x27;t use too much bc it&#x27;ll start flaking.</li>
            <li> I have dry loose curls.  This stuff works well.  I have to go light in the summer or the back of my neck tends to get clammy.  But otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product with good results.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product after reading the positive reviews but NOW I&#x27;m super excited to GET A REFUND.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is SO sticky. It made my hair a stringy, sticky, crunchy MESS. Even worse was when I was working out and it was making my sweat sticky as well! I couldn&#x27;t even touch my hair without then washing my hands due to the stickiness. Horrible :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and have a TWA. I use this to twist my hair with my fingers and define my curls. It gives my curls so much definition. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best product for taming curly frizzy hair!  Smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> Was delivered in a timely manner, I really like this hair that helps style and give my hair body.  I hope they never discontinue this product</li>
            <li> Best styling product for my hair. Love love love!!!!</li>
            <li> The go-to product for my wavy hair. A small amount goes a long way. Haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> I forgot how GREAT this product works on making my naturally curly hair look so awesome! I had stopped using TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock for awhile and began using a less expensive curly hair product, that did a good job making my curls look nice, but not fantastic. So, I chose to begin using the TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock again last month and have never been happier as this product makes my hair look good. My hair doesn&#x27;t look freezy while using TIGI&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock. My curls are well defined and take the shape of spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Great! Love this product! This is the best price I have found! The lowest I have paid outside of here is $16 per bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I dilute with a little water as it is very sticky when you put it in your hand.  It does make beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a product that would help my curls after I used a diffuser (before, I would use one with some random curl creme and an hour later, my hair would be completely frizzy) This stuff worked wonders! It&#x27;s a little sticky and thick but as long as it works, I don&#x27;t care :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and have always struggled with styling my curly hair.  I don&#x27;t have tight curls, and I don&#x27;t have super lose curls, but in between and tighter underneath, than on top.  I discovered this product eons ago, but didn&#x27;t apply it correctly and lost interest in it as I kept getting that crunchy look.  After purchasing it again and reading others reviews, I find it&#x27;s helpful to apply when my hair is very wet, and scrunching it as it dries...I stop scrunching it when it&#x27;s almost dry, otherwise you start separating the curls.  Doing it this way prevents the crunchy feel and it is soft to the touch!  I shampoo and condition every other day, if not more, and this holds my curls for that long.  When I do wash, it feels like you&#x27;re rinsing out conditioner when you first get your hair wet, so it feels like this product conditions, while promoting curls.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  I hate that it&#x27;s discontinued, and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do once the stock runs out, but I am very pleased with this product and my hair feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you want dry curls. It is fantastic for that old 80s wet look curls tho. that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have this curly thing down yet. Product seems slimy to me. I&#x27;ll use it more when I have no where to go to see if I can get my hair to do what it says it does</li>
            <li> I have long curls and this is one of the only products that keeps my hair looking descent for several days.</li>
            <li> My misses has some serious curls and this product works well to get rid of frizz and pump up her curls.  She uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian with very curly hair which easily becomes frizzy. This product is wonderful -- can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly and frizzy hair... i cant even brush my hair if i do it turns into a huge ball of frizz all over my head, its absolutely hideos. This product is the only product that works and i mean only product... i have the graveyard of hair products in my house... from the most expensive to the cheapest and this stuff is the absolute best!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair in ringlets and no amount of humidity frizzes it... i admit it leaves it wet looking but i would rather have that than frizz and when you wash it, its soft and you can feel the moisture from the product.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope this isnt a product that i have finally found that phases out because that always happens to me.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for years now.... just try it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon prices are the best so far becuase it is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WB</li>
            <li> I live in Miami. I have curly hair. That should say so much already with my five star rating of this. Only thing that keeps my curls under control WITHOUT getting crisp or crunchy! Not too soft though, which in Miami means at the end of the day you will look like Tina Turner, and not in a good way. I only use this. Get it. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have 3Cish hair (a little bit of a mixture) and I am in love with this product!  I hardly ever say that.  I have bought so many curl creams that I just wasted money on...they sit in my drawer because they are too greasy, too crunchy, dull etc etc.  You curly ladies know what I am talking about!  Put this in and it is amazing.  Smells good, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, didn&#x27;t have to do a lot of work after putting it on.  Best of all, after drying, my hair is shiny and soft!  I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> Name says it all!  Curls rock with this product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair and it always looked frizzy so I kept it in a ponytail most of the time. My friend introduced me to this curl amplifier and I have been hooked for years. I put less than a quarter size dollop in my hand, I rub my hands together and push this cream through my hair and then flip my head upside-down and blow dry it. My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy even after blowing it dry, which is an amazing feat all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the product smells. There are some curling amplifiers that literally make me gag and I cannot use them. I have given many of those products away because they smell so bad. This has a very pleasant fragrance and the consistency is not gel-like or mousse like, it has its own feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel crunchy, but this product pretty much gives you a choice, if you are a fan of the wet look crunchy curls you can do that, or you evenly apply this and blow dry through it to give you nice curl and waves. I don&#x27;t even use hairspray because I like the way this product works in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have huge curly hair - and I feel like this is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that gives me an entire day&#x27;s worth of hold.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry, not so curly, not so straight hair. It has a mind of it&#x27;s own and I have struggled for years to find something to help hold the curl, but not be too &#x27;crunchy&#x27;. I use their leave in conditioner from this line and some mousse along with this, then diffuse my hair for a few minutes. This smells good, spreads easy and defines the curls and keeps frizz away. I really like the second day hair, because instead of re-washing and fixing again, which is drying to my hair....I can just spray water on my hair and it seems to re-activate the creme, so that it works as well the second day as well. I heard somewhere that they were replacing this amplifier with the new line from TIGI. I hope not, I have tried the Curlesque creme and it does work, but seems to dry my hair out more.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have rather curly hair and are always trying new products to help our curls look non-frizzy and soft and bouncy.  This product is our favorite!  Only tip I have to offer is make sure you only use a very small amount like the direction suggest.  It only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I always use this curl amplifier with its companion product, Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Booster, and have fantastic results.  The secret is putting the product on when your hair is sopping wet and blowing dry with a diffuser.  The only complaint I have is these products are a little pricey, but for the results I get, I am willing to splurge.</li>
            <li> I use this for pixie hair because my sister didn&#x27;t like it for her curls. It is th ick and is hard to wash off of your hands and if you use too much it just globs. But I love the definitionit ggives without weight or too much shine and it gives a wet look that&#x27;s not too intense.  My biggest concern is that the stuff flakes in your hair so you have to not touch your hair all day andyou need a  new application every day.  However it willmmaintain a natural looking style the whole time it&#x27;s in</li>
            <li> I have trillion every product out there (almost) and this is the ONLY one I love and have used it for years.  Get so many compliments on my hair and how it smells.  It really is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I am very glad that Amazon still carries this product!  It works really well for curly hair, and you don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts a long time.  Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Best sealant for my color treated, curly hair.  Been using for years and my stylist says I have really healthy hair because of it.</li>
            <li> When the shop I go to stopped carrying this product I almost cried. This product offers thee hold I want without my hair being stiff.</li>
            <li> The amplifier is incredible.  I am now using 3 Catwalk Curls Rock products (Shampoo, Conditioner and Amplifier) and my hair has never been curlier or shinier!  I don&#x27;t know if the shine is from shampoo, conditioner or amplifier, but I think it has something to do with using all of them at once because I&#x27;ve been using these products separately for years and have never had this same experience.  Thank you TIGI!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that will frizz in a heart beat.  This product is the only one I&#x27;ve used that will stop the frizzes.  I live in the South and haven&#x27;t tried it in the hot Summer/humidity so I can&#x27;t comment on the Summer frizzes.  So far, I&#x27;m good with this product and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is a good product.  I will buy this again.  I like this product.  It is a good product.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> intense curl keeper, but leaves hair a bit &#x27;crunchy&#x27;</li>
            <li> This product is great for my naturally curly hair. It controls the frizz and helps the curls take a more natural shape. I first found it at Target, but when they stopped carrying this product, I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have short 2c/3a curls. I decided to try this product after my go-to styling product (fructis garnier fiber gum putty) was discontinued :(. Maybe I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of this yet, but I just don&#x27;t get the same results with Curls Rock. It is *very* easy to apply too much product. My curls get sticky and stiff, and after a day or so fall apart completely. Frizzy mess. I apply it right out of the shower on damp hair, then typically air dry and finish with a diffuser to add a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Curls Rock is 3x more $$ than my previous product, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying?</li>
            <li> This is absolutely, hands down, the only product that I can use on my thick, sometimes frizzy, curly hair! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they were to just stop making it! I can&#x27;t use mousse because it can&#x27;t control my hair and the alcohol in it has adverse effects on my hair! Gel is terrible! It took me forever to find the right product! Thank you Curls Rock! You really do rock!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use to style my curly hair...the best!  I tried lots of \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; options to see if I could replace it...but,  no luck...this is my favorite and lasts a while!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, but I didn&#x27;t realize the instructions would say to use it after another product- the curl booster.  I don&#x27;t really have the time to mess with too many products.  I was looking for a quick solution for air-drying and I will move on to something else.  (By the way, I realize it might look funny that this posted under a man&#x27;s name.  This is from the wife.)</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that works for my long, thick, frizz prone hair, and in the Florida humidity. Only wish I had found it 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> After trying many recommended products I&#x27;ve been using this for about a decade. It tames the frizziness of my curls without too much control or stiffness. Target stopped carrying it so I&#x27;m glad to find it on amazon at an even lower price.</li>
            <li> Out of all the different products I have tried over the years, this is the only one that work with my hair. I have naturally curly hair that tends to get frizzy easily. This product keeps the curls looking nice and stops my hair from looking frizzy. Its the best!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have struggled with my curly hair relentlessly until I found Curls Rock.  All I need is two little squirts and I am good to go (and I even have really long hair!).  I highly recommend it to any curly-haired girl!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Product as described, works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following the Curly Girl (CG) hair method of not using any silicone or sulfate products on my hair for almost two years, and love how healthy my hair has gotten, especially as I&#x27;ve grown it out.  Although my hair has gotten healthier, I&#x27;ve still been battling with constant frizz, so I recently decided to add in a few silicone products.  If you are following the CG method, supposedly the one silicone in this evaporates as your hair dries, so it&#x27;s not as damaging as regular silicone-based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I love what this does for my hair!  It makes my fine waves look perk up and look like they&#x27;ve been styled with a curling iron -- and the best part is that there is little frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about three inches past my shoulders, and I use two pumps of this to cover my hair, followed by a bit of gel.  After washing and conditioning my hair, I flip it upside down in the shower, squeeze out some of the water, and then distribute one pump of this on my palms, using the wetness to coat my skin.  I think glide and scrunch it into my hair. I then add the second pump, making sure that all the hair is coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the darker blue and turquoise Curlesque version of this, which has a slightly different ingredient list, but they seem to work about the same.  (I bought the Curlesque one ages ago, but wanted to get this one too to compare since reviews I&#x27;d read online said that this older version is better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the smell of this (and the Curlesque) version is pretty strong in a chemically sort of way.  The smell also lingers into the second day.  This is my reason for four stars instead of five.  Overall, though, this is an excellent product that really does give perfect, frizz-free curls!</li>
            <li> This is a great product just a little expensive. One of the few products I have found for my extremely course curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t take so much product to keep curls ruley. Must try it!</li>
            <li> Only product I have liked so far for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for creating soft curls if you have wavy to curly hair.  It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy and greasy.  It also does not leave it crunchy like some products.  Amazon has the best price as this is more expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product years ago. Then TIGI changed their product, &amp;#34;Curlesque&amp;#34; is not the same quality. This is far superior.</li>
            <li> This product is literally the best!! I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products that aim towards taming curly frizzy hair and this is the ONLY one that actually works!!  I have quite a bit of thick curly hair and I find that one pump of this stuff is usually the perfect amount.  It seems to go a bit further if you mix with a little bit of water on your hands too.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this stuff!! Curls Rock!</li>
            <li> If you have fine, frizzy, curly hair in need of a thick-textured but light feeling cream, this is it! I always have a difficult time finding the right products but I use this product with Bedhead&#x27;s Root Lifter spray and Masterpiece hairspray! Love it!</li>
