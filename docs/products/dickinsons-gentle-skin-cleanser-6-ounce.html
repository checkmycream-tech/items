            <li> The texture is quite weird and gooey, and like others have mentioned produces no lather.</li>

            <li> Really helps remove any excess oil at the end of the day after wearing make-up. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves it feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Only place near me that I can buy this is at Walgreens but they only sell online, not in store. This offers a great alternative... And a GREAT DEAL!  The product is the only face wash I can easily purchase @ decent price that has ABSOLUTELY NO PORE CLOGGING INGREDIENTS. simply awesome! Be careful ppl, even if it says &amp;#34;non- comedogenic&amp;#34; on the label,  products USUALLY have some ingredients that are but they are minimal,so they can still call it non comedogenic. But for someone who has such sensitive skin, like me, that little amount matters! It takes some research but there are products out there that are Tru to their label claims, Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Foaming Facial Wash is one of those! :)&lt;br /&gt;PS, U Can find list of  &amp;#34;the good/bad list: non comedogenic/ comedogenic ingredients and products&amp;#34;  on acne.  Org forums! sumone was nice enough to compile their own research to help others, hope this helps sumone :)</li>
            <li> Does not wash off makeup very well.  I don&#x27;t use heavy makeup at all or waterproof mascara but this just smeared my makeup and felt tacky on my skin.  The wipes are amazing but skip this face wash.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this for $2.99 at Ocean State Job Lot. Definitely check there first if there&#x27;s one in your area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser with no scent whatsoever. I works nicely with the witch hazel pads that I purchased. It&#x27;s a nice large container - that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my niece and her face looks so much better. She likes the fresh smell and the texture of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with this cleanser is it doesn&#x27;t produce any lather. I understand it&#x27;s all natural but without any sort of lather, I feel like I&#x27;m not cleansing my skin and I end up using more product. I went ahead and purchased the Dickinson&#x27;s foaming cleanser in hopes that will resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser so much. Its helped me clear up my face. This was the first thing i found that would be good for my sensitivity and my oily skin. I definitely will repurchase this cleaser. The only thing that i dont like it smells a little funny but its all natural so it doesnt have any perfumes which is good.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on your skin.  I have been using it for over a month and my skin feels great.  It leaves your skin balance and not so oily.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. It gets my face pretty clean and it&#x27;s very mild like it says. I just learned that my skin likes soap-free or low-suds products, so this is perfect for me. It does cause a mild breakout on my skin, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I only use it once a month and wash my face with water in between. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of witch hazel, especially dickinson&#x27;s and was quite happy with the cleanser they once had before it got discontinued and suddenly went unavailable! I tried this one in the hopes it would be similar but it was not even close. The texture is quite weird and gooey, and like others have mentioned produces no lather. I did not feel like my face was cleaned at all by this, which was validated when i used my toner afterwards. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all unless you would like to leave your face feeling dull, dry, and well- dirty.</li>
            <li> We love these!  Used for many different things and very gentle on the skin!</li>
            <li> stop gap measure while waiting for their foaming facial cleanser to become available again, if it doesn&#x27;t JASON has a good product to replace dickinsons.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter. She likes it</li>
            <li> Very gentle face wash.  I can use it twice a day without moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  On top of that it does still make my skin feel clean.  I cannot say that it has been helping very much with my acne or oily skin, but I really think that those things are caused a lot more by what we put into our bodies...</li>
            <li> So far im loving it and i have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am still dealing with acne from medicine I&#x27;m on, in my thirties, but my skin is drying out too. I am very fair. This wash has cleared up my skin and leaves me feeling moisturized. A little goes a long way, so the price is great. It has almost no scent. It is cruelty free and made in the USA. And no harsh chemicals or unnecessary dyes or fragrances or ingredients are used. I follow with the toner. Works great!</li>
            <li> Great accompaniment to my daily splash of Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel that I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;been dousing myself with for better than fifty years. It cleanses my face before&lt;br /&gt;my morning shave and the straight Witch Hazel is my aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> just started using and so far like it</li>
