            <li> I like that it has witch hazel because it helps soothe my itchy, dry combination</li>

            <li> * Clean-looking, slightly matte skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In searching for what other products LAVO makes, I found this.  </li>
            <li> Then, I carry it around and spray whenever my skin feels a little dry.</li>
            <li> It contains allantoin, which is the active compound in the healing herb comfrey, aloe vera, and ginseng, all of which are soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients.</li>
            <li> My skin has been acting all crazy lately and this soothing toner helped calm down the redness.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe - mild, not pleasant or unpleasant,</li>
            <li> I add 4 parts distilled water to 1 part toner then add to a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I wash my face up to three times a day and apply moisturizer and it starts to dry out really bad, especially in the morning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at washing my neck before bed</li>
            <li> I remember the old days of Oxy and Sea Breeze blue astringents and toners and how it stung horribly!</li>
            <li> No tightness or stinging which are very common for me with toners.</li>
            <li> so if you like the feeling of Aloe or the smell of cucumber, get this and try it -- they really mean it when they say guaranteed!</li>
            <li> It smells faintly of witch hazel and that reminds me of being a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the smell personally but isn’t a terrible smell.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Toner is very nice and gentle.  My skin has been acting all crazy lately and this soothing toner helped calm down the redness.  I love that it is alcohol free and love the ingredients of cucumber juice, aloe, witch hazel and ginseng.  These ingredients are all wonderful and soothing for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that fluctuates with the weather. I love to use this toner as a facial mist. I add 4 parts distilled water to 1 part toner then add to a small spray bottle. (You can get a travel size one at the dollar store or Walmart.) Then, I carry it around and spray whenever my skin feels a little dry. It adds a great glow to my skin + the bottle lasts even longer that way! Glad that I was given this complimentary sample for review purposes, as I&#x27;d definitely use again going forward. It’s a great combo when used with the exfoliating toner. (See my review for more info on that one.)</li>
            <li> Love this toner! It is alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t try my skin out. It tightens pores and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Best toner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and hydrating! I also mixed an 80% water &amp; 20% toner as instructed on box in a spray bottle to keep in my bag for these hot summer days!</li>
            <li> Seems easy on the skin.  Have changed to with haze with cucumber.  Cheaper and seems fine.</li>
            <li> I always tone my face right after I wash it or right after I put on a face mask.&lt;br /&gt;This particular toner is the only toner I used right after I used a face mask.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes facial mask (especially the mud masks) can strip off the oils and moisture in our face, so a rehydrating toner is a must.&lt;br /&gt;Since I only use this once a week, a little goes a long way for me. There is a particular scent with this one but for me it&#x27;s no biggie since it&#x27;s mild.&lt;br /&gt;This toner is very hydrating for me and I have oily skin so I dont use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But whenever I use this, my skin is so smooth and glowing, I feel like this toner gives my skin the refreshment that the mud mask removed.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I love it, definitely recommend it.i think that this will be best for normal to dry skin types.&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin like mine, use this whenever youre done with any facial masks. It doesnt sting and it&#x27;s gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing</li>
            <li> Really appreciate this product being ALCOHOL FREE! It makes a huge difference, especially to those with sensitive skin. I remember the old days of Oxy and Sea Breeze blue astringents and toners and how it stung horribly! I really appreciate any company that makes an effort to avoid chemicals this this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and the feel of this - fresh, spa like, not chemical-laden and not too strong. I generally use it at night after the shower and a bit in the morning before moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way. It is definitely soothing, and you do NOT have tight skin or sensitivity after using this (at least I don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to these kinds of products.)  I find it helps the makeup sit better (this plus a primer, pore product, and moisturizer - but each do help ;) The biggest difference is in the look of pores - nothing will fix these, but it definitely helps! I use a number of pore products with this one and they really do make a difference when used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that they do not animal test also! Yay! Definitely recommend this one - have enjoyed trying a few of Lavo&#x27;s products -CS is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

            <li> I have been using this toner for about 10 days now and I like it. It smells faintly of witch hazel and that reminds me of being a teenager.  This toner doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;m not very good at washing my neck before bed so I use this toner to get rid of  the makeup/ sunscreen on my neck in the evening. I try to use organic when I can so this is a big plus.  My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I prefer glass bottles and this comes in a plastic one.  I&#x27;m 52 years old ( today )</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel the freshmess it brings to my face</li>
            <li> Helped to hydrate my skin after using the mud mask! Almost had a cooling effect and feels wonderful</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Hard to describe - mild, not pleasant or unpleasant, sort of musky witch hazel? There is fragrance oil in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Splash of fresh, cool water.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Pretty neutral. No tightness or stinging which are very common for me with toners. There is a mild, non-irritating astringent effect.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I have very sensitive oily skin and it works for me ....I think it should be okay for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No indication.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Plastic screw-top bottle with a flow restrictor - stopper with a hole in it. Be better off in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Clean-looking, slightly matte skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Ingredient list has chestnut extract; I’d like to know if it’s horse chestnut extract because if so that’s excellent for your skin. It contains allantoin, which is the active compound in the healing herb comfrey, aloe vera, and ginseng, all of which are soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients. I’d expect it to have a positive effect on irritated skin, and I agree with the manufacturer’s suggestion to put some in a spray bottle and use it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

            <li> Nice sized bottle of toner, feels great on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and mild, not astringent or harsh in any way. Easy to use, it has a top that allows a small amount to come out so it cannot be easily overused or spilled. Perfect for dabbing onto a round or cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt; It does not dry out the skin after use and I usually see that even more makeup  is removed that I thought had already been washed off. I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbaised review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. It&#x27;s watery but absorbed really good. I wash my face up to three times a day and apply moisturizer and it starts to dry out really bad, especially in the morning, I put a little bit of this toner on and my skin feels even more clean and refreshed. I did not get any skin or allergic reaction while using it. I like that it has witch hazel because it helps soothe my itchy, dry combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the smell or the aloe-y feeling and will stick with my Keihl&#x27;s.  AMAZINGLY quick customer service from LAVO for the guarantee so if you like the feeling of Aloe or the smell of cucumber, get this and try it -- they really mean it when they say guaranteed!</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old with combination and sensitive skin.  I purchased my first LAVO product (ultra detoxifying mud mask) and really liked it.  In searching for what other products LAVO makes, I found this.  It is a great addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Most toners are far too drying on my sensitive skin, but I really liked this one. I do not use toners alcohol, so I was happy to see this one does not include it. This toner also makes a great mist, re-hydrating my face as the day progresses. It&#x27;s gentle and soothing for my irritated skin. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Love this hydrating toner, wish Lavo would come out with a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it and she absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very hydrating on dry areas (in my wife&#x27;s case cheeks and chin)&lt;br /&gt;- Wonderful smell</li>
            <li> Lavo Aloe Rehydrating Facial Toner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is a clear liquid that a slight white hazel type of smell.  I am not a fan of the smell personally but isn’t a terrible smell.  The smell does go away fairly quickly after applying though.  This toner helps nourish the skin especially when combined with a moisturizer.  It doesn’t irritate my skin and works well after shaving, especially since it has witch hazel as an ingredient.  I will update my review if my observations change over long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
