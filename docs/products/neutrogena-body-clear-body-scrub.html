            <li>but it smells great.</li>
            <li>Three pack would be great on subscription.</li>
            <li>because I have oily skin, feels good with exfoliating gloves or rag.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>The beads in this seem to dissolve too, which is good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Has a very pleasant smell and is not overly powerful.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Great price and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This body wash smells amazing and the exfoliant in it works nicely.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and the exfoliating beads are nice.</li>
            <li>I liked using it</li>
            <li>It was nice smelling, yet ineffective for me.</li>
            <li>Great clean aromatic body wash I bought for my daughter.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, seems to be working for me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s boyfriend loved using it so much that I bought him this three pack for his birthday!</li>
            <li>Refreshing, light, and uplifting aroma.</li>
            <li>Love love love and the pink grapefruit is a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Use it more often in the summer months but is great all year round.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a couple weeks now twice a day and havent seen it&#x27;s full effect yet.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciated that I was able to buy it in a pack of three.</li>
            <li>After starting to use it daily in the shower, my skin is feeling good and looking so much better!</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon offers the three pack on a Subscribe and Save discount!</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It cleared my skin up rather quickly and really minimized breakouts.</li>
            <li>I find that I feel super clean with clear skin after each wash.</li>
            <li>It really is a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>I would probably alternate between this and a more moisturizing, sudsy body wash throughout the week.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and exactly as description</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and mild ichthyosis</li>
            <li>and so it is not as luxurious, but this product isn&#x27;t really meant to be luxurious anyway.</li>
            <li>the smell was lighter than I expected, but love this purchase</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much acne except for on my rear.</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on your skin type etc..</li>
            <li>It really has helped my skin too without drying it out.</li>
            <li>yet it remains gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used the Neutrogena facial cleanser in the pink grapefruit version and was very pleased with it</li>
            <li>To this day, I still have super oily skin that is very prone to breaking out, so I continue to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this body wash since I was in high school (10 yrs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new staple in my beauty regimine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love the product, but too small.  </li>
            <li>so when choosing a body wash, it was the natural choice.</li>
            <li>There is definitely foam, but it doesn&#x27;t stretch as much as some other ones I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it made my acne worse :/</li>

            <li> You can feel the micro beads, but not in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get a bad conscience when using it because of plastic beads polluting water and being consumed by fish etc</li>

            <li> Good product. Smells good. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The only product that keeps my body breakout-free. Love love love and the pink grapefruit is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and does what it says. Wakes me up in the shower. Energizing. The only part that is somewhat annoying is that it does foam as much as I&#x27;d like. There is definitely foam, but it doesn&#x27;t stretch as much as some other ones I&#x27;ve used and so it is not as luxurious, but this product isn&#x27;t really meant to be luxurious anyway.

            <li> Cleared up skin within a a week and completly in 2 weeks!! Best.stuff.ever! Amdnit smells awesome too !</li>
            <li> the smell was lighter than I expected, but love this purchase</li>
            <li> I had been unaware that the bubbles were plastic.  I had assumed they were like previous face washes I&#x27;ve purchased that had bits of peach pit or something in them.  I was rather upset to discover that they were actually blobs of plastic!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly as description</li>
            <li> Works a treat!! I had pimples on the back of my thighs &amp; based on a &amp;#34;google recommendation&amp;#34; tried this product and got it shipped to NZ (cause we don&#x27;t have it for sale here) - it is really amazing!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it made my acne worse :/ It smells nice and the exfoliating beads are nice. I liked using it but it made stuff worse. I&#x27;ve never had much acne except for on my rear. After using this, I got pimples on my armpits and chest. And it certainly didn&#x27;t help my rear :( I think it really depends on your skin type etc..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job &amp;#34;clearing&amp;#34; your body but it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this body wash since I was in high school (10 yrs +). I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I never notice it after I get out of the shower. It was actually my doctor who told me I should try it when I was breaking out during volleyball. It cleared my skin up rather quickly and really minimized breakouts. To this day, I still have super oily skin that is very prone to breaking out, so I continue to use it on a daily basis. Like others have said, the bottles don&#x27;t last a terribly long time. I can get a few weeks out of a bottle if I&#x27;m careful and no one else in the house is using it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but too small.  Only get about 5 washes per bottle</li>
            <li> for wife, she likes it</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple weeks now twice a day and havent seen it&#x27;s full effect yet. You can feel the micro beads, but not in a bad way.  Will continue to use and hope for productive results</li>
            <li> I wish they made bigger bottles.  This is by far the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  This is better than other expensive brands I&#x27;ve used like Bliss.&lt;br /&gt;This takes care of body acne, rough patches and dead cells without drying out your skin.  I have sensitive skin and mild ichthyosis so I usually am very careful about choosing body cleanser and this is a winner and it&#x27;s affordable too.</li>
            <li> It was nice smelling, yet ineffective for me. Great price and easy to use. I have very sensitive skin so I appreciate that it was not to harsh.</li>
            <li> I had won this body wash as part of a spa basket at a friend&#x27;s party previously, and decided to place it in our guest bathroom.

The bottle is on the smallish size but when used with a loofah it lasts me a while, unlike other posters had stated. I&#x27;ve now got this on a subscribe and save and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great product for a decent price.  Three pack would be great on subscription.</li>
            <li> Great clean aromatic body wash I bought for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have used the Neutrogena facial cleanser in the pink grapefruit version and was very pleased with it so when choosing a body wash, it was the natural choice. The scent is fresh without being overpowering. It has acne fighting properties within it yet it remains gentle on the skin. I find that I feel super clean with clear skin after each wash. I also really appreciated that I was able to buy it in a pack of three. It&#x27;s a new staple in my beauty regimine.</li>
