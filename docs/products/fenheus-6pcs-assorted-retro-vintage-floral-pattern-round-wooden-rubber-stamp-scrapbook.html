            <li> I ordered these stamps for Mayhem to use in his crafting efforts. He is almost six now, and he enjoys stamp printing and clay embossing. I have not tested these stamps on polymer clay or the Crayola Air-Dry clay yet, but I&#x27;ve posted a photo with a quarter coin and the stamped images to give an idea of size. I am satisfied with these stamps; you can&#x27;t beat the price, and they do what they are supposed to do. I may order a backup pack if these are as popular with the nugget as I anticipate.</li>
            <li> These are darling stamps and great patterns.  I used them in my polymer clay work and they look super</li>
