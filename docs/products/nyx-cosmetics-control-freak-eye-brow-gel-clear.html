    <ol>
            <li>tames my brows perfectly</li>
            <li>and they stay perfect all day.</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>It is so amazing!</li>
            <li>Seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this brow gel!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>so I liked that</li>
            <li>Happy that NYX produces a cost effective gel that is available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, you do need to reapply it 1-2 times a day, so make sure you always have it handy in your purse.</li>
            <li>Incredible hold, not stiff or flaky.</li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best eye brow gel.</li>
            <li>Really helps my eyebrows stand out and look amazing!</li>
            <li>super fast shipping, great quality....does what it&#x27;s supposed to do....</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this stuff would smooth them out.</li>
            <li>this gel simply groom my daughter&#x27;s eyebrow for a good 8 hours, fantastic !</li>
            <li>For the most part, all of the reviews said it was great, and I even checked out a few videos from beauty gurus on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried something new, but I will not repurchase the NYX.</li>
            <li>I bought this brow gel for my 14 years daughter, she has a set of eyebrow that many would dream of .. full and naturally shaped ..</li>
            <li>When I first saw the reviews for this product I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>For something that was so cheap, it does it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it with postage costs, so hopefully someone else I know can make use of it.</li>
            <li>I honestly do better taming them with a regular eye brow brush and some lotion or the moisturizer I use on my face.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>ok so i actually bought this for my husband because he has wild eye brows...</li>
            <li>Not the best to make your brows stay put but for the price not to bad.</li>
            <li>This product was a huge let down for me.  </li>
            <li>This made it easy, the gel is clear, so I use a pencil or powder to add a little color and correct then after I use the clear gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another clear brow gel...</li>
            <li>However, I would prefer if if did come tinted with color instead of clear.</li>
            <li>That was a mistake; my hair is naturally curly, so my brows curl too.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my brows but leave white flakes.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> my favorite. not flakey and thick at all</li>
            <li> It is so amazing! Definitely the best eye brow gel. It keeps my crazy brows in place all day</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well. Not sure if it lasts all day, but for a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li> For something that was so cheap, it does it&#x27;s job very well. Keeps my eyebrows tamed and doesn&#x27;t ever flake. However, you do need to reapply it 1-2 times a day, so make sure you always have it handy in your purse.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Brows stay put all day!</li>
            <li> Love this brow gel! Incredible hold, not stiff or flaky. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I use this after my eyebrow pencil.  It keeps the color in and my eyebrows in the shape that I desire.  Love it!</li>
            <li> tames my brows perfectly</li>

            <li> My brows are thin and curly so I was hoping this stuff would smooth them out. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> I use this daily...great product.  Really helps my eyebrows stand out and look amazing!</li>
            <li> Not the best to make your brows stay put but for the price not to bad.</li>
            <li> Does its job so I liked that, I found that the brush often had clumps of gel that had go be wiped off to use it</li>
            <li> When I first saw the reviews for this product I was excited to try it out.  For the most part, all of the reviews said it was great, and I even checked out a few videos from beauty gurus on YouTube.

I honestly do better taming them with a regular eye brow brush and some lotion or the moisturizer I use on my face.  This product was a huge let down for me.  I would&#x27;ve sent it back but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it with postage costs, so hopefully someone else I know can make use of it.</li>
            <li> Difficult to locate brow gel at local pharmacy. Happy that NYX produces a cost effective gel that is available on Amazon. I like the consistency. It&#x27;s an actual gel and is not greasy.  However, I would prefer if if did come tinted with color instead of clear.</li>
            <li> ok so i actually bought this for my husband because he has wild eye brows...he wanted a clear gel to at least make them look groomed.  this definitely did that however he said it had a crunchy feel to the eye brows when it dried.  but he likes it and continues to use it.  i myself have not ever tried brow gel because my brows are trained to behave...but if i needed to use it i would try it.  super fast shipping, great quality....does what it&#x27;s supposed to do....keep your eye brows in line</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Dries hard and crispy and it doesn&#x27;t hold brows in place all day. Disappointing. I&#x27;ll be going back to my dependable Tweezerman brow mousse. Glad I tried something new, but I will not repurchase the NYX.</li>
