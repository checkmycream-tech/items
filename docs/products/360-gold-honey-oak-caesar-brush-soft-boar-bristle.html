            <li>This is a sexy hrush that will get yo waves on point.</li>
            <li>it off then brush some more.</li>
            <li>Dont put more grease in your hair as it will clog your hair.</li>
            <li>You can do this throughout the day but its better to do before you go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>the investment in this brush is well worth it no doubt!!</li>
            <li>but if you put in effort and take care of your hair then its easy.</li>
            <li>the only good thing I liked was the arriving shipping date came in sooner</li>
            <li>Great brush for when you&#x27;ve got a low cut.</li>
            <li>and like i said earlier i intend to complete it with the best weapons out there.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for fresh cuts.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3.Wash your hair,you can also brush your hair while in the shower to train your hair even better because when your hair is soft its the easiest way to train.</li>
            <li>Contoured shape of the brush is exactly what you need to get and maintain waves.</li>
            <li>Of course when you first use it you have to break it in and some bristles are gonna fall out</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a very committed waver then these brushes are a must have in your collection because they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li>i like the way it waves it works really well.</li>
            <li>It really does contour your head.</li>
            <li>Has a Fast shipping day to.</li>
            <li>My son is very involed with his hair and the waves in his hair.  </li>
            <li>Even if you have straight hair using this brush will still get you waves.</li>
            <li>It really does contour to the shape of your head like everyone</li>
            <li>,you dont have to do it as much as people say.5 10 min sessions should be good enough to train your hair to lay down and curl which is what waves</li>
            <li>I myself use natural coconut oil by organic but you must first use wave grease to get it started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when my hair gets longer it makes me want to have a more firm bristle, but the curve is truly time saving</li>
            <li>The 360 wave soft ceaser brush is hands down the best softy on the market it does wat its says its gonna do in little effort an less time....</li>
            <li>And it comes with a classy looking bag for the brush.  </li>
            <li>you hair frequently</li>
            <li>Use a soft bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I got the Soft Caesar Brush</li>
            <li>I had ordered a soft crown quality brush gold honey oak Caesar style idk if its a medium or a soft mixed brush because it came with a open medium box when I has specifically ordered a soft brush that really piss me off...</li>
            <li>Definitely better than any other brush on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>Continue for a solid 2 months and they will be deep and shiny and turn heads and make people seasick and very nauseous</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first thinking the brush was just over hyped but it really does work i saw a change in my waves and connections the first day i used it.</li>
            <li>This soft brush came and saved me from me hard, old dingy hard brush with its old bristles, and actually laid down my hair better.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband whose hair is very thin on top and fuller at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It is a lil hard when you first get it.</li>
            <li> The brush feels professional and almost therapeutic to the scalp running through every grain, laying the hair down in a uniformed pattern.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting a Medium and a Hard to complete the set.</li>
            <li> Brush was a little harder than I expected</li>
            <li> All my other brushes Is obsolete softy, medium or hard if its a crown brush u have to try it and see the different for yourself</li>
            <li> He has at least ten brushes and he says&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now my baby granddaughter can have her mother&#x27;s sterling silver hairbrush(sterilized, of course)passed down to her.</li>
            <li> Price could be a little cheaper in my opinion though.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll lose a about 15-20 little stray brush bristles in the beggining</li>
            <li> I should have bought one with a handle though because I find the one&#x27;s with handles are less tedious on your hands when brushing for long.</li>
            <li> until it is almost dry,then take the grease and put it on your hair and continue to brush for at least 10-15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I dont have the thick hair</li>
            <li> a must have for serious wavers</li>
            <li> These brushes are a blessing to the wave game.</li>
            <li> If you have a difficult time I will tell you my method for 360 waves that turns heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was told the box was wrong</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results from this product.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband whose hair is very thin on top and fuller at the bottom.  He was using my daughter&#x27;s old silver baby hair brush because everyting else was too rough for his balding head.  This brush with the soft boar bristle is perfect.  He loves it.  Now my baby granddaughter can have her mother&#x27;s sterling silver hairbrush(sterilized, of course)passed down to her.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than any other brush on the market hands down. I would recommend this brush to anybody looking for waves.</li>
            <li> All my other brushes Is obsolete softy, medium or hard if its a crown brush u have to try it and see the different for yourself cause I&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> Excellent product that is worth the price paid. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results from this product. Stay wavey</li>
            <li> Brush was a little harder than I expected but it was a good thing. Contoured shape of the brush is exactly what you need to get and maintain waves. Price could be a little cheaper in my opinion though.</li>

            <li> This is a gorgeous brush. Warning do not expect to gret a bag too. I would recomend dropping this since its wooden, and its finish. It is a lil hard when you first get it. You&#x27;ll lose a about 15-20 little stray brush bristles in the beggining then it&#x27;ll stop, No biggy for me. It really does contour your head. I noticed my wave pattern being enhanced as I looked in the mirror. Has a Fast shipping day to. ordered on sunday got it on thursday.</li>
            <li> Used to have one of the Annie brushes, but this one brings out the waves really nicely.  And it comes with a classy looking bag for the brush.  Top quality here..don&#x27;t let the price scare you.</li>
            <li> My son is very involed with his hair and the waves in his hair.  He has at least ten brushes and he says&lt;br /&gt;they all have a specific job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves this one</li>
            <li> This is a sexy hrush that will get yo waves on point. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The 360 wave soft ceaser brush is hands down the best softy on the market it does wat its says its gonna do in little effort an less time.... a must have for serious wavers</li>
            <li> No doubt this is the best brush i have ever purchased. I was skeptical at first thinking the brush was just over hyped but it really does work i saw a change in my waves and connections the first day i used it. Of course when you first use it you have to break it in and some bristles are gonna fall out but that&#x27;s with any brush. All i know is im definitely getting another one as soon as possible the investment in this brush is well worth it no doubt!! CQP is all im using from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for getting the waves you want.The brush even feels amazing when you brush your hair.Even if you have straight hair using this brush will still get you waves.I myself am mixed so I dont have the thick hair so it takes a while for me to get waves and takes time but if you put in effort and take care of your hair then its easy.If you have a difficult time I will tell you my method for 360 waves that turns heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Get this brush,a wave enforcer du rag or wave cap,and wave grease.You can use wave builder or sportin waves.I myself use natural coconut oil by organic but you must first use wave grease to get it started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Brush you hair frequently,you dont have to do it as much as people say.5 10 min sessions should be good enough to train your hair to lay down and curl which is what waves are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Wash your hair,you can also brush your hair while in the shower to train your hair even better because when your hair is soft its the easiest way to train.Use a soft bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Dry your hair but not completely,have it somewhat damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.Brush your hair until it is almost dry,then take the grease and put it on your hair and continue to brush for at least 10-15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Slap on du rag or wave cap for an hour or 2,take it off then brush some more.Dont put more grease in your hair as it will clog your hair.After brushing put it back on.You can do this throughout the day but its better to do before you go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.After 2-5 days you will begin to see the difference and after a solid 2 weeks of brushing and using this method the 360 waves will be there but not as deep.Continue for a solid 2 months and they will be deep and shiny and turn heads and make people seasick and very nauseous</li>
            <li> Well I got the Soft Caesar Brush and I love it. It really does contour to the shape of your head like everyone says covering as much as possible. I&#x27;m definitely getting a Medium and a Hard to complete the set. The brush feels professional and almost therapeutic to the scalp running through every grain, laying the hair down in a uniformed pattern. This is by far the best brush in my arsenal to date and like i said earlier i intend to complete it with the best weapons out there. If you&#x27;re a very committed waver then these brushes are a must have in your collection because they&#x27;re worth every penny. These brushes are a blessing to the wave game.</li>
            <li> If you have a low cut hair style this brush should work for you. Within about a week of using this brush I started to notice that I was accumulating some waves.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a soft crown quality brush gold honey oak Caesar style idk if its a medium or a soft mixed brush because it came with a open medium box when I has specifically ordered a soft brush that really piss me off...the only good thing I liked was the arriving shipping date came in sooner that what bit said that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I got the brush but it had a crack on the edge and came in a medium box, I was told the box was wrong but the brush is a softy.</li>
