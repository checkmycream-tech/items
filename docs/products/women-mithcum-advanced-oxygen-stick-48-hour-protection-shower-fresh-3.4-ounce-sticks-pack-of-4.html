            <li>Although the sticker on the cap reads: superior strength odor protection with odorguard, these guys must be nuts.</li>
            <li>Mitchum has a good reputation and since item was on sale</li>
            <li>4 stars cause honestly haven&#x27;t found any deodorant/antiperspirant that is really great.</li>

            <li>I love the scent and the gel formula</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this deodorant/antipersperant works for some people, but this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that people differ in which deodorants work for them.  </li>
            <li>This antiperspirant is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It was lightly scented and there is no build-up.</li>
            <li>I remain dry and I smell great.</li>
            <li>Definitely a brand to try if you&#x27;re having issues finding a good deodorant.  </li>
            <li>you can even skip a day&amp;#34; was so true.</li>
            <li>It was so much better than what is available in stores here in New Zealand</li>
            <li>Just ok; I switched to a different product that had better scent</li>
            <li>The one I bought is shower fresh</li>
            <li>Effective, non staining, and terrific range of fragrances.</li>
            <li>This Mitchum deodorant is the only kind that I - and even my boyfriend - use.</li>
            <li>I work 12 hour shifts in a very hot warehouse and it lasts the whole time!</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and has found this to be the only kind that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash or flare up when used.</li>
            <li>the stick is surprisingly nice and unlike any other stick products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Certain shirts can become discolored where the armpits are.</li>
            <li>I smelled like pure BO within an hour of application, and I really caked the stuff on.    </li>
            <li>Works very well.   </li>
            <li>It hurt so much I had to rinse the product off to get relief.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t matter what I do.</li>
            <li>This depends on how much you use, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this.</li>
            <li>and I think I have enough to last more than six months.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it will feel super sticky and gross.</li>
            <li>I normally buy Mitchum Women&#x27;s Gel/Anti-Perspirant.</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t like stick products.</li>
            <li>I always put up with the slow drying time because the slogan &amp;#34;so effective</li>
            <li>this deodorant/antiperspirant was strong when there was a good or bad smell.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am allergic or overly sensitive to some ingredient they use because my underarms literally burned!  </li>
            <li>I have large red marks under my arms now.  </li>
            <li>early nineties.</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>I gave only 2 stars because the product leaks and oozes out of the top.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this goes far beyond disappointment.</li>
            <li>I spent almost $4 for this thing on a whim, as my normal deodorant was out.</li>
            <li>leaves my armpits a little squishy, I probably use too much.</li>

            <li> I hate having to try and try new products hoping I would get it right the first time to help me with odor and sweat.  </li>

            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t overdue it you shouldn&#x27;t get the issues.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for only getting Â½ the product.</li>

            <li> I wasted money yet again on this product and currently I am using a crystal deodorant for odor with a crystal spray.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours, I&#x27;m stinky, and definitely by the end of the day.  </li>

            <li> This is not a good product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy EVER again.</li>
            <li> This was an unintentional purchase that had been a money saving two pack placed in the wrong slot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> leaves my armpits a little squishy, I probably use too much. But it does the job and I think I have enough to last more than six months.</li>
            <li> I spent almost $4 for this thing on a whim, as my normal deodorant was out. I have never before had an issue with odor, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of deodorants. I walked around for 2 days with this terrible smell before I realized it was me!    Although the sticker on the cap reads: superior strength odor protection with odorguard, these guys must be nuts. I smelled like pure BO within an hour of application, and I really caked the stuff on.    Honestly, this goes far beyond disappointment. I&#x27;m actually rather angry. Did they even test this product?</li>
            <li> Just ok; I switched to a different product that had better scent</li>
            <li> Works very well.   Definitely a brand to try if you&#x27;re having issues finding a good deodorant.  I do like that these are the taller size.</li>
            <li> Mitchum has a good reputation and since item was on sale I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Mistake!  I guess I am allergic or overly sensitive to some ingredient they use because my underarms literally burned!  It hurt so much I had to rinse the product off to get relief.  I have large red marks under my arms now.  I hope they don&#x27;t scar.  Will be contacting the company about this. :(</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant seemed to be all the rage in odor and sweat control from reviews and what I read.  I tried other deodorant/antiperspirants before but never this one.  I hate having to try and try new products hoping I would get it right the first time to help me with odor and sweat.  This product says on the outside how it helps with odorguard technology but that is false!  The one I bought is shower fresh and I would have wanted to buy one that was unscented but couldn&#x27;t find one.  But I bought this anyway to see if it would still work in its \\&quot;odorguard\\&quot; technology.  It can smell like perfume at one moment but later it smells like fish?  I use unscented products as much as possible and this deodorant/antiperspirant was strong when there was a good or bad smell.  I wasted money yet again on this product and currently I am using a crystal deodorant for odor with a crystal spray.  I rather sweat and not smell than to do both, together!  This is not a good product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy EVER again.</li>
            <li> I normally buy Mitchum Women&#x27;s Gel/Anti-Perspirant. This was an unintentional purchase that had been a money saving two pack placed in the wrong slot.&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t like stick products. Usually there is a lot of build-up. While they usually work o.k., I don&#x27;t like gunk in my arm pits or having white stuff brushing off onto my clothes. Nasty.&lt;br /&gt;This was a pleasant surprise. It was lightly scented and there is no build-up. I bathe every day and apply this afterward. It really doesn&#x27;t matter what I do. Working out, gardening, sunning myself or just hanging around. I remain dry and I smell great. I have experienced no outbreaks or irritations. I also use less of this stick than I do of the gel. Not an issue for me based on either product but the stick is surprisingly nice and unlike any other stick products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I  like the deodorant a lot,  it has a nice scent and works well.  I gave only 2 stars because the product leaks and oozes out of the top. It must be kept upright at all times. You cannot just throw it into a suitcace. It leaks out. I read others reviews that mentioned this, but I didn&#x27;t take it seriously.  I  learned the hard way when I went away for a weekend and it spilled out and ruined  some toiletries.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I work 12 hour shifts in a very hot warehouse and it lasts the whole time! Best deodorant out there!</li>
            <li> This deodorant does the job, but only when it&#x27;s not crumbling into pieces. About Â½ way through each one, it began to crumble, rendering it useless. Pretty expensive for only getting Â½ the product.</li>
            <li> I tried this deodorant while in the States some years ago. It was so much better than what is available in stores here in New Zealand I got a family member in California to send packs to me. Now I buy it online from Amazon.  Effective, non staining, and terrific range of fragrances.</li>
            <li> This deoderant worked great for a week and then out of no where just stopped working. It left me stinkier than wearing no deoderant at all!</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I will use. I love the scent and the gel formula</li>
            <li> Awesome product, great price from amazon subscribe and save. This stuff works the best out if everything I have tried. My husband loves the men&#x27;s version as well.</li>
            <li> I like not having to run out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this deodorant/antipersperant works for some people, but this product does not work for me.  Within a few hours, I&#x27;m stinky, and definitely by the end of the day.  I also have a different  product Almay with the same ingredient that also does not work:  both are 25% aluminum sesquichlorohydrate.  I&#x27;m sure that people differ in which deodorants work for them.  While I was growing up, my mother always used Dry Idea, which has a different ingredient, but it never worked for me.  I bought them in dual packs at a box store, so now I have 2 totally unused packages of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum since the late eighties / early nineties. I always put up with the slow drying time because the slogan &amp;#34;so effective you can even skip a day&amp;#34; was so true. Even stuck with when, even though the package size stayed the same, the product was less. This stuff however cannot be the same formula. I start to notice odor after about 6 hours. They cannot call this 48 hour. My mother also is having the same problem after using Mitchum as long as I have. They need to go back to what ever they were doing before. I am sadly moving on.</li>
            <li> This Mitchum deodorant is the only kind that I - and even my boyfriend - use. He has very sensitive skin and has found this to be the only kind that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash or flare up when used. Even the more expensive clinical kinds did not work too well for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for myself, I couldn&#x27;t stand how stick deodorants left residue and would flake off. This kind works great, most of the time. There are two issues, but they are not so bad as to make me hunt for a new brand:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sometimes it will feel super sticky and gross. I usually find this to happen when I wear a tank top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Certain shirts can become discolored where the armpits are. This depends on how much you use, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this. As long as you don&#x27;t overdue it you shouldn&#x27;t get the issues.</li>
            <li> When I was a teen I began having an incredibly heavy perspiration issue.  Not until I found this deodorant did anything help.  I don&#x27;t use ANYTHING else!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Like the fact that I can buy 4 at a time. This antiperspirant is pretty good. Not messy. 4 stars cause honestly haven&#x27;t found any deodorant/antiperspirant that is really great.</li>
