            <li>Last forever and doesn&#x27;t ale much for a beautiful suttle look</li>
            <li>While the color is beautiful, you can&#x27;t do much in terms of highlighting and contouring with only one color.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Easy transaction and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The look stays fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes contouring for beginners easy and fast.</li>
            <li>well worth buying once, but now that I know how to get the look I want, I&#x27;ll be shopping elsewere.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>gives you a glow, natural sparkle and bronzed that you have always desired :)</li>
            <li>Right after I started wearing this</li>
            <li>extra great outcome  for the fairly low price i paid&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I like using these bronzers with a fan brush to apply, since at first I used a kabuki brush</li>
            <li>Love the cards with application tips for different looks.</li>
            <li>This set includes Chocolate Soliel (a matte cocoa, for darker tans), Sun Bunny (a medium beachy duo), Snow Bunny (a sun kissed duo), and a pretty illuminator called Powdered Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much a gave it to my niece</li>
            <li>and I felt it gave me too much product when I use the &#x27;W&#x27; apply method.</li>
            <li>Straight to the point....</li>
            <li>different ways of bronzing is SUPER</li>
            <li>And the colors of the different blushes are exactly what I looked for.&lt;br /&gt;highly</li>

            <li>/&gt;only downside to me is that its not a long ware!</li>

            <li> With these it&#x27;s kind of a necessity; I went to put on a fresh swipe of Sun Bunny in the \\&quot;3\\&quot; formation down my face, and as there was some residue from the previous use I ended up with an ugly dark smudge on my temple.</li>

            <li> This is the best bronzer I have ever own in my whole life!!! I also received it very quickly!!</li>
            <li> step my step visual instructions provide great make up tips. I love the &amp;#34;lose 10lbs in 10 seconds&amp;#34; instructions. There are 2 others to chose from as well. I don&#x27;t like how little there is. These powders are less than an 8th inch deep. well worth buying once, but now that I know how to get the look I want, I&#x27;ll be shopping elsewere.</li>
            <li> My sister sent me this and I loved it so much a gave it to my niece and I decided to find another one here on amazon.  I love the cheat sheets that come with it so that I know exactly where to apply each powder.  I purchased a big brush to apply with so that it comes out even on my face.  Great powder will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered fast, tried it cause a friend got it and was very satisfied&lt;br /&gt; I love the bronz primer! And the colors of the different blushes are exactly what I looked for.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really love this bronzer set. The chocolate soleil color is a matte dark bronzer that smells like chocolate, which I use for a blush on occasion. Then there is the sun bunny and the snow bunny, with the powdered sun highlighter, which I use all together according to the helpful cards that are included. I like using these bronzers with a fan brush to apply, since at first I used a kabuki brush and I felt it gave me too much product when I use the &#x27;W&#x27; apply method. Overall this a great bronzer kit and I highly reccommend!!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this pallet. I use it every single day. I love it so much I bought a second one before my first was even halfway done because I saw it on sale. Love the look books that come with. Makes contouring for beginners easy and fast. I get so many compliments when I use this.</li>
            <li> this is a great combo of bronze and highlight..i love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only downside to me is that its not a long ware! after 4 hours it starts to feed and u need to touch up..&lt;br /&gt;but! on the other side..they give u the primer which makes it stay a bet longer....&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced should make more and more of there beautiful kits...i would buy them allllllll&lt;br /&gt;its extra great outcome  for the fairly low price i paid&lt;br /&gt;and the card-ex that come inside that show u different ways of bronzing is SUPER&lt;br /&gt;i love love love it</li>
            <li> Great bronzer, bronzed look without looking orange. Love the cards with application tips for different looks. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> We are huge fans of Too Faced cosmetics and this bronzer kit was on my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list. Bought it for her birthday and it was well received!</li>
            <li> This gives your skin a beautiful glow. You can literally apply tons without cake face problems. It lasts a while too. Definitely worth the buy. Although, if your skin tone is darker it definitely will not show up. You will look pale.</li>
            <li> I think this set makes me look like a supermodel! I love how its really easy to do and comes with the how-to lesson cards. I got so many compliments wearing this! I usually only wear mascara with this set though. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to really pale people since it might look weird as the colors are dark. However, I loved this set! It was a good deal for the price and all the things it comes with.</li>
            <li> I really liked this bronzer palette. I was looking for a bronzer... and this completed my necessaire. The look stays fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift but she loves it and it looks amazing on.  I have a different one but same brand. Last forever and doesn&#x27;t ale much for a beautiful suttle look</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t believe I used to have a makeup routine without it!! It makes such a difference in how my face &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34;. I definitely suggest adding blush to the apples of your cheeks.  Right after I started wearing this I had coworkers asking me if I lost weight because of the contours it added to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! The primer is wonderful, the powder smells good (to me at least), and the little &amp;#34;cheat ideas&amp;#34; stuffed in the package are wonderful tools too! I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I honestly, didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but the chocolate bronzer smells yummy. I hoped to love it as this is the first attempt for me in the path of contoring and highlighting</li>
            <li> Straight to the point....&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping was on time&lt;br /&gt;- Opened this packaged&lt;br /&gt;- fell in love with it&lt;br /&gt;- gives you a glow, natural sparkle and bronzed that you have always desired :)</li>
            <li> Love this! The perfect contour kit for beginners!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful palette!  Very natural looking bronze effect and the gold shimmer adds a little something extra for special evening or events. Easy transaction and very fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> For the longest time the only bronzer I had was a little glitter flecked one I&#x27;d gotten at Victoria&#x27;s Secret. While the color is beautiful, you can&#x27;t do much in terms of highlighting and contouring with only one color. I decided to get myself some proper bronzer, but unfortunately being pretty is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for sets like this! They allow you to try out different types of bronzers in smaller pans, as well as let you learn how to properly apply it with three little \\&quot;get the look\\&quot; cards that are included, and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. This set includes Chocolate Soliel (a matte cocoa, for darker tans), Sun Bunny (a medium beachy duo), Snow Bunny (a sun kissed duo), and a pretty illuminator called Powdered Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great first time bronzer kit; the cards are super helpful! Just make sure you clean your brushes after every use. Some products you can get away with just shaking them out and wiping them clean on a tissue if you don&#x27;t have the time or patience to clean them every day. With these it&#x27;s kind of a necessity; I went to put on a fresh swipe of Sun Bunny in the \\&quot;3\\&quot; formation down my face, and as there was some residue from the previous use I ended up with an ugly dark smudge on my temple. As I was on a schedule and didn&#x27;t want to remove my primer, I simply covered it up with my hair, but knowing it was there bothered me. Just be sure to clean those brushes!</li>
