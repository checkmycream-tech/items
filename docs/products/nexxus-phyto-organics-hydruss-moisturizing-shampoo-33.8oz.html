            <li>I blame Nexxus, which I suspect knew perfectly well that its dispenser tops were defective but decided to deal with it by sending these to Amazon to unknowingly distribute.  </li>

            <li>Ylang Ylang is a wonderful EO for your hair!</li>

            <li>Okay, to clarify:  The shampoo itself is great, no problems there.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is very rich and creamy and it smells and cleans great.</li>
            <li>and I continue to keep my hair healthy with Nexxus!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love Nexus, but this product aggravates my allergies.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the push-down dispenser top does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Love nexxus.</li>
            <li>Years ago, my stylist taught me about healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Would buy again for sure...</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product more than a decade.</li>
            <li>but I love it as a body wash.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really stand out as remarkable in any way.  </li>
            <li>The best shampoo for dry hair that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because  you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot, it&#x27;s very light and smells soooo nice</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner from this brand yet (though I wanted to try to), because I had a full bottle of the product I was using for a year and was very happy with it, and now will go back to that product again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>great for my daughters too who have various textures of hair.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and fresh feeling!  </li>
            <li>and I always feel like my hair/scalp didn&#x27;t get as clean as it should have.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or color treated hair, this is great mosturizing.  </li>
            <li>Great for hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>but hey, it&#x27;s shampoo and it rinsed clean and right off!</li>
            <li>and my hair has such a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I find that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to lather very well without adding more water to your hair after application.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo of all time.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, the scent turned me off the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel healthy and does not add to my naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li>It just is a very clean shampoo line that really makes your hair come alive!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel right when I wash my hair with it.</li>
            <li>I love when Ylang Ylang is in shampoo and especially conditioner.</li>
            <li>Never fails.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought that may be it is not a shampoo but something else</li>
            <li>The thing is I bought such a big bottle relaying on the all the good reviews in here and now don&#x27;t know what to do with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I did not return the shampoo because I was in need of it, but I certainly won&#x27;t order it again.  </li>
            <li>This product really makes my processed hair shiny + silky every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give a try to this one because this is organic, and there is some bad ingredient in that my shampoo which causes some head skin problem, but, seems like that one is the best for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stylist and absolutely recommend not only the company but this product!!!</li>
            <li>And the conditioner of my old product now rescues my hair after this shampoo \\&quot;destroys\\&quot; them..</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for dry over processed hair, but the pump was broken!</li>
            <li>After shampooing my hair feels softer, and less frizzy, but the conditioner makes it feel more dried out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not going to repurchase this and go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only thing comes to my mind is an old style broom which grows in a rural area and people make a broom from it.</li>

            <li> I did start to use this until the last couple of day. I noticed that it smelled different and at a closer look it is not the same as pictured or described. I am not sure if Nexxus changed the look or if I got a fake product. It doesn&#x27;t feel right when I wash my hair with it. I would like some help and any idea&#x27;s. I have had the product for awhile I just haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for dry over processed hair, but the pump was broken!</li>
            <li> Love Nexus, but this product aggravates my allergies.</li>
            <li> Great price,fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Pump came broken, really thick green goop and smells funky</li>
            <li> Okay, to clarify:  The shampoo itself is great, no problems there.  But I gave it the lowest rating for a reason.  The problem is that the push-down dispenser top does not work at all.  This is the SECOND order I have made through Amazon for this product, and I have had the same problem BOTH times.  I did not return the shampoo because I was in need of it, but I certainly won&#x27;t order it again.  I do not blame Amazon.  I blame Nexxus, which I suspect knew perfectly well that its dispenser tops were defective but decided to deal with it by sending these to Amazon to unknowingly distribute.  This is underhanded, even fraudulent, merchandising.  I think Amazon should kick them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and absolutely recommend not only the company but this product!!! It just is a very clean shampoo line that really makes your hair come alive!!! Gotta say Nexxus still got it!!! And the company I used through Amazon was so amazing to buy from!!!</li>
            <li> I usually use Nexxus shampoo and conditioner and thought I would see if this was more hydrating than my ordinary shampoo. I have very thick hair that is about mid back in length. I also tend to color my hair every 8 wks. I find that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to lather very well without adding more water to your hair after application. It does not seem like it helps retain moisture and I always feel like my hair/scalp didn&#x27;t get as clean as it should have. I&#x27;m definitely not going to repurchase this and go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  If you have dry or color treated hair, this is great mosturizing.  Helps control the annoying fly aways without making your hair feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love nexxus. This shampoo is very rich and creamy and it smells and cleans great. I am African American with relaxed hair down the middle of my back. Been using nexxus for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> When I received the 2 bottles of shampoo both bottles had been opened and the shampoo was running out of the cap. The push nozzles to extract shampoo were broken on both bottles. Very disappointed with product</li>
            <li> So bad when I received it the bottle was broken and it smells so bad it s not the same nexus  phyto hydruss shampoo I used to buy. so disappointed</li>
            <li> Years ago, my stylist taught me about healthy hair. This was the product she used on my hair for 12 years.  Now she has moved away and I continue to keep my hair healthy with Nexxus!</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really stand out as remarkable in any way.  It does the job but the smell is not pleasing.  As a matter of fact, the scent turned me off the very first time I used it and I almost gave it away.  But I decided to keep it and used the entire bottle so as not to be wasteful.  But I will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It makes my hair feel healthy and does not add to my naturally oily hair. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo of all time.  Leaves hair clean and fresh feeling!  During shipping it leaked a bit but hey, it&#x27;s shampoo and it rinsed clean and right off!</li>
            <li> I love when Ylang Ylang is in shampoo and especially conditioner.Ylang Ylang is a wonderful EO for your hair!</li>
            <li> We have horrible water and I have color in my hair....love this shampoo.  Would buy again for sure...great for my daughters too who have various textures of hair.</li>
            <li> Great for hair that tends to be dry. It was recommended by the salon where I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. It lasts forever and I know I am putting a good product on my colored treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing shampoos! Smells wonderfully. I also got the photo Organiics Nectress nourishing conditioner, I don&#x27;t care for it. After shampooing my hair feels softer, and less frizzy, but the conditioner makes it feel more dried out. I would definitely recommend the shampoo though!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for dry hair that I have ever used.  It is fabulous</li>
            <li> We all know &amp;#34;There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute.&amp;#34; well I&#x27;m guilty. Totally mislead with &amp;#34;ORGANICS&amp;#34; in the produce name. It is no different than all the other chemically laden products surrounding us. Well... I keep looking.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Never fails. Moisture adds boday. Leaves hair looking great. Gave some to my sister who purchases regularly as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how my hair feel after I wash with this shampoo. The first time I thought that may be it is not a shampoo but something else and I tried again in a couple of days and it happened again and again. It makes my hair feel immediately&lt;br /&gt;very very dry and sticky. I don&#x27;t know how to explain this. The only thing comes to my mind is an old style broom which grows in a rural area and people make a broom from it. Or may be a very tough rope?... The thing is I bought such a big bottle relaying on the all the good reviews in here and now don&#x27;t know what to do with this shampoo. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner from this brand yet (though I wanted to try to), because I had a full bottle of the product I was using for a year and was very happy with it, and now will go back to that product again (feel bad that cheated on their shampoos). I decided to give a try to this one because this is organic, and there is some bad ingredient in that my shampoo which causes some head skin problem, but, seems like that one is the best for me. And the conditioner of my old product now rescues my hair after this shampoo \\&quot;destroys\\&quot; them..</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because  you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot, it&#x27;s very light and smells soooo nice and my hair has such a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product more than a decade. It is good !</li>
            <li> This product really makes my processed hair shiny + silky every time I use it. Comments from others after I condition are guaranteed + flattering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this as a shampoo but I love it as a body wash.</li>
