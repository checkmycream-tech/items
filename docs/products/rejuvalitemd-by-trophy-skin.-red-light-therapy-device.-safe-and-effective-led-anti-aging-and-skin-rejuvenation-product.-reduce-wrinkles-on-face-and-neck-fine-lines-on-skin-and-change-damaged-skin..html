    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My twin brother says that when I talk, that muscle is very expressive.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I am impressed by the results.  </li>
            <li>The one-year warranty is great.</li>
            <li>Also, exercising 3x/week helps to keep me in good health.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe the beautiful difference the RedMD LED Anti-Aging Light Therapy Device has made for filling in lines and plumping up my skin.  </li>
            <li>and they dealt with the situation efficiently and courteously.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for months now and can honestly say I&#x27;m blown away by the results.  </li>
            <li>I think there needs to be more research.</li>
            <li>have been using it morning and night and set my timer for thirty minutes (most of the time I go to sleep or meditate).&lt;br</li>
            <li>A more flexible, or longer arm might make the positioning of the unit over your face easier</li>
            <li>Regardless, having the device at home is so much more</li>
            <li>The nightstand in placed close to the SIDE of the bed touching the bed.  </li>
            <li>Complexion looks more refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hands free capability which I thought would be a wonderful change from the hand-held Baby Quasar, and I was hopeful that the results would be something to write home</li>
            <li>, it would be the one thing I THOUGHT I was going to love the most: the hands free nature of the device.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>So I do strongly recommend it, although I do not know why the price went from $199 to $399.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I held out because this product, and more importantly, the results I&#x27;ve received with it, have been well worth it.</li>

            <li>That is pure speculation on my part; however, the product does effectively work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the machine six days ago, and the light went out.</li>
            <li>just started to use this light but already notice changes around my eyes....</li>
            <li>, it is the hands free ability that is my primary issue with this device.)</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>still early to see how good</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, a good organic lotion (EveryDay Shea Butter in Vanilla from Whole Foods Market works splendid) and an exfoliating pad (Target Up Brand Exfoliating Pads) takes care of that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was excited about</li>
            <li>Somewhat concerned, but excited that I was seeing SOMETHING, I contacted customer service and was assured that this indicated that the product was working.</li>
            <li>I would still flush bright red.</li>
            <li>So far, I am loving the results.</li>
            <li>The unit functions very well, strong orange and infrared lights (non visible light).  </li>
            <li>Eventually, (in light of the results I saw fairly quickly) I rationalized that it was kind of like when I used to go to the tanning salon back in the day.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, (in light of the results I saw fairly quickly) I rationalized that it was kind of like when I used to go to the tanning salon back in the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid for light therapy in salons for a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I balked at first at the high price, but I am glad</li>
            <li>Well... there&#x27;s not too much you can do with a blazing light pallet in your face, so I&#x27;m just sitting there...</li>
            <li>Well... there&#x27;s not too much you can do with a blazing light pallet in your face, so I&#x27;m just sitting there...</li>
            <li>I have used it far more than the minimum recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this is a powerful piece of machinery.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, this thing is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>I see right now</li>
            <li>RIGHT,.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced, but she assured me it was a good sign, but if I was concerned, to use the product less often in the beginning.</li>
            <li>As a result of using the Red MD, that fine line has either diminished significantly or disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an overall better complexion and try to use it right after I get up in the morning for about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>My treatments are convenient and relaxing (very much like meditating).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The purchase price now is much higher then when I purchased it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I believe LED light therapy to beneficial, but it must be used frequently to see improvements.</li>
            <li>Even with all that being said, the most age reversing results that I have seen has been with the RED MD.  </li>
            <li>you can afford to get two RED MD lamps, I do recommend purchasing two for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a product like this</li>
            <li>My skin improved but seems somewhat sensitive to the light.</li>
            <li>Now, after roughly 5 months of using this product off and on, I can honestly say, this is the product I was looking for when I purchased the Baby Q years ago.  </li>
            <li>A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE LIGHT BULBS IN VARIOUS SPOTS ON THE PANEL WILL NOT LIGHT UP...</li>
            <li>I really am not sure if I am seeing results however my skin looks good</li>
            <li>If I could do it to ruin my skin, I could certainly do it to try to bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I could do it to ruin my skin, I could certainly do it to try to bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have been using this for 2 weeks and see a difference all ready.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced that this is of much value.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say I can see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the Trophy Skin LED system.  </li>
            <li>Did alot of reading about LED light therapy for various skin conditions and chose this brand and type because of the recommendations.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It works, but each person should use it carefully and not assume that using it 20 minutes a day is safe.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, I began seeing real results after about three weeks of continual use.</li>
            <li>when I use it, I flip the light head up so that it&#x27;s parallel to my face</li>
            <li>when I use it, I flip the light head up so that it&#x27;s parallel to my face</li>
            <li>, I think that would be the most significant complaint at this time.  </li>
            <li>Really excited for future results.</li>
            <li>i loved it at first, i think it works, is too expensive right now..</li>
            <li>so I like trying products that can keep my skin healthy especially since in my younger years</li>
            <li>Of course being twins, I could not let my twin brother use the device and prevent aging while I continue to look older.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To make a long story short, I had this fine wrinkle on my forehead over my right eye.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I suspect that due to all of the 5 star reviews, the makers of the RED MD said, &#x27;Hey, this product really works and because it REALLY works, we can charge more.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>That is just so much hassle for busy people to do.  </li>
            <li>I began using the RedMD after I purchased the Baby Quasar, was less than thrilled with the results, and it was suggested that I give the Red MD a try.</li>
            <li>I bought this device quite some time ago, and used it only briefly, so I need to get back on a regular routine to give it a fair chance/review.  </li>
            <li>I have been known to fall asleep and take long naps while under the lamp (greater than 20 minutes) with no major adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the goggles on (I put some white electric tape over the holes so that there is a reduction of red light coming through the goggles).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this red MD light for approximately two weeks and today, for the first time since I started using it, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone and noticed more firmness around my jawline.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and the results are amazing--and ultimately, that&#x27;s really all that matters to me!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and the results are amazing--and ultimately, that&#x27;s really all that matters to me!  </li>
            <li>The deep marionette lines (I know that&#x27;s not the correct term) around my nose are less prominent also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I did notice that sometimes my skin and neck does get dry from using the RED MD light therapy</li>
            <li>and I completely forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Baby quasar (baby Q) on and off for months prior to receiving this product but never saw results that even came close to what I saw after the first use of the Red MD.</li>
            <li>takes personal time to lay down with the light positioned just so over your face.  </li>
            <li>The  lamp is a littler smaller than I thought, but it is of high quality.</li>
            <li>Eventually, due to the discomfort in my hand, wrist, and elbows, and muscle cramping, I stopped using it all together and place the blue and red Baby Quasar in my nightstand, never to see the light of day again</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this RED MD light therapy lamp gets a GREEN light!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this RED MD light therapy lamp gets a GREEN light!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item it was a very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this type of therapy must be used regularly to see results, so in that respect I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to give it a proper review.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>My skin was rosier, clearer and generally looked healthier that it had in months.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve seen real improvements in my skin tone and tautness.  </li>
            <li>Well it is very relaxing to lie down and have a rest.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is that you do NOT have to continually get dressed, drive, park your car, enter the spa, wait for availability of the LED light, have your treatment, pay up at the front desk, schedule your appointment when you have time, walk out of the spa, get in your car, drive home with all those stop lights and people on the road cutting you off, park your car at home, get into your house, change out of your clothes...</li>

            <li> The deep marionette lines (I know that&#x27;s not the correct term) around my nose are less prominent also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did notice that sometimes my skin and neck does get dry from using the RED MD light therapy</li>
            <li> and I completely forgot about it.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Baby quasar (baby Q) on and off for months prior to receiving this product but never saw results that even came close to what I saw after the first use of the Red MD.</li>
            <li> takes personal time to lay down with the light positioned just so over your face.  </li>
            <li> The  lamp is a littler smaller than I thought, but it is of high quality.</li>
            <li> Eventually, due to the discomfort in my hand, wrist, and elbows, and muscle cramping, I stopped using it all together and place the blue and red Baby Quasar in my nightstand, never to see the light of day again</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this RED MD light therapy lamp gets a GREEN light!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> When I purchased this item it was a very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this type of therapy must be used regularly to see results, so in that respect I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to give it a proper review.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My skin was rosier, clearer and generally looked healthier that it had in months.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve seen real improvements in my skin tone and tautness.  </li>
            <li> Well it is very relaxing to lie down and have a rest.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that you do NOT have to continually get dressed, drive, park your car, enter the spa, wait for availability of the LED light, have your treatment, pay up at the front desk, schedule your appointment when you have time, walk out of the spa, get in your car, drive home with all those stop lights and people on the road cutting you off, park your car at home, get into your house, change out of your clothes...</li>
            <li> I try not to raise my right eyebrow, but it is hard to concentrate on not doing that.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 weeks now on the trial and have decided to keep it because it works on two problems I have - facial saginess/puffiness and spots from scars and acne long ago.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I can report that after just one use my skin looked splotchy, red, and a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I took her word for it and kept at it, though less frequently as suggested.</li>
            <li> and I have always been a bit skeptical about light therapy.  </li>

            <li> i might look towards buying this item, but thought some reviewers were beyond ridiculous going on about having to be still for 10-20 mins while using it…think they&#x27;ve had one too many cups of coffee if being still for 20 mins is such an arduous task ,… they sound as annoying as the people who feel the obsessive need to whip out or look at their phone every few minutes …willing someone to call</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really am not sure if I am seeing results however my skin looks good I&#x27;m almost sixty and look 45 so I like trying products that can keep my skin healthy especially since in my younger years I did a lot of unprotected gardening and sun tanning, seems to work for me</li>
            <li> I bought the machine six days ago, and the light went out.</li>
            <li> just started to use this light but already notice changes around my eyes....I&#x27;m 57 and have read up on all the devices out there....I wouldn&#x27;t even consider something that you have to hold in each spot for 10. min....if that was the case I would never do it...This is the answer...Thank you Trophy!</li>
            <li> So far so good...still early to see how good but I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks and I think I&#x27;m seeing lightening of some brown spots and acne scars have definitely improved some.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and see a difference all ready. My skin feel tighter and fuller.I use it 20 minutes a day it&#x27;s easy and convenient. I would recommend this to all woman wanting to improve all skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Saw no improvement in skin after going through all the contortions to place the useless thing where it needed to be and wasting that much of my time.</li>
            <li> Well it is very relaxing to lie down and have a rest. I am not convinced that this is of much value. I have used it everyday 2 times a day for 30 mins for 22 days. I really can&#x27;t say I can see any difference in my skin. I think there needs to be more research. The intensity is probably NOT what you would get at the dermatologist office. I am not convinced. Also I am not sure if you need to use it for a longer period of time to measure results.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a little puffiness in the morning and some slight skin discoloration. Been using it for 3 weeks now on the trial and have decided to keep it because it works on two problems I have - facial saginess/puffiness and spots from scars and acne long ago. I have an overall better complexion and try to use it right after I get up in the morning for about 20 mins. Highly recommended. Thanks!</li>
            <li> A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE LIGHT BULBS IN VARIOUS SPOTS ON THE PANEL WILL NOT LIGHT UP...WHY? HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL GET BACK TO ME.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve seen real improvements in my skin tone and tautness.  I&#x27;m addicted to this thing.  When I recently had a mechanical problem with it, I emailed customer service at Trophy Skin and they dealt with the situation efficiently and courteously.  The one-year warranty is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this red MD light for approximately two weeks and today, for the first time since I started using it, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone and noticed more firmness around my jawline.  The deep marionette lines (I know that&#x27;s not the correct term) around my nose are less prominent also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it morning and night and set my timer for thirty minutes (most of the time I go to sleep or meditate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I see right now is, if you are not tired or sleepy it can be boring lying down so long doing nothing but I think the results will outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a face master and have been using it faithfully for two years.  However, although I have seen some improvement, Ithink it&#x27;s effectiveness has peaked and felt I needed to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to use this new, expensive system, and report further results in a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this device quite some time ago, and used it only briefly, so I need to get back on a regular routine to give it a fair chance/review.  I&#x27;ve paid for light therapy in salons for a much higher price.  When I purchased this item it was a very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this type of therapy must be used regularly to see results, so in that respect I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to give it a proper review.&lt;br /&gt;It takes personal time to lay down with the light positioned just so over your face.  The unit functions very well, strong orange and infrared lights (non visible light).  A more flexible, or longer arm might make the positioning of the unit over your face easier, I think that would be the most significant complaint at this time.  The purchase price now is much higher then when I purchased it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the unit functions as it is supposed to, and I believe LED light therapy to beneficial, but it must be used frequently to see improvements.</li>
            <li> Simply said, this thing does not work. I have used it far more than the minimum recommended and I see ZERO results. What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> i might look towards buying this item, but thought some reviewers were beyond ridiculous going on about having to be still for 10-20 mins while using it…think they&#x27;ve had one too many cups of coffee if being still for 20 mins is such an arduous task ,… they sound as annoying as the people who feel the obsessive need to whip out or look at their phone every few minutes …willing someone to call / text them …when no-one is!</li>
            <li> I really like the Trophy Skin LED system.  I tried the Baby Quasar and it was such a hassle.  I would have to sit in front of a mirror and hold the wand up against my face.  It literally took forever to get a treatment in.  Eventually, due to the discomfort in my hand, wrist, and elbows, and muscle cramping, I stopped using it all together and place the blue and red Baby Quasar in my nightstand, never to see the light of day again and I completely forgot about it.  Then one day, I was purging out &#x27;stuff&#x27; from my house doing some &#x27;spring cleaning&#x27; and I came across the Baby Quasars and threw them in the trash.  I&#x27;d rather have a nice clean empty drawer in my nightstand than a constant reminder of something that works, but is very inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, my twin brother mentioned this device and bought one and tried it and swore by the results.  Of course being twins, I could not let my twin brother use the device and prevent aging while I continue to look older.  That was just not going to happen.  So I upped my twin brother and instead of buying just one, I bought two (it was $199 each when I bought it and now it is $399/each...so I&#x27;m thankful to the Lord that I bought it on the dip...LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I had this fine wrinkle on my forehead over my right eye.  My twin brother says that when I talk, that muscle is very expressive.  I try not to raise my right eyebrow, but it is hard to concentrate on not doing that.  As a result of using the Red MD, that fine line has either diminished significantly or disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I do use Retin A, eat only organic foods, do not eat meat/dairy/sugar/wheat/processed foods/junk foods.  I don&#x27;t smoke or drink alcohol and I wear sunscreen judiciously.  Also, exercising 3x/week helps to keep me in good health.  Even with all that being said, the most age reversing results that I have seen has been with the RED MD.  So I do strongly recommend it, although I do not know why the price went from $199 to $399.  I suspect that due to all of the 5 star reviews, the makers of the RED MD said, &#x27;Hey, this product really works and because it REALLY works, we can charge more.&#x27;  That is pure speculation on my part; however, the product does effectively work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford to get two RED MD lamps, I do recommend purchasing two for more coverage.  However, if you can only afford one, just buy one.  What I really like about this product is that you do NOT have to continually get dressed, drive, park your car, enter the spa, wait for availability of the LED light, have your treatment, pay up at the front desk, schedule your appointment when you have time, walk out of the spa, get in your car, drive home with all those stop lights and people on the road cutting you off, park your car at home, get into your house, change out of your clothes...etc.  That is just so much hassle for busy people to do.  In addition, you have to go during regular business hours from 9-5 PM Monday through Fridays (maybe some salons are open on Saturday).  Regardless, having the device at home is so much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lay down on the bed horizontally and place the two RED MD on a nightstand I purchased from Target.  The nightstand in placed close to the SIDE of the bed touching the bed.  Then, I put a pillow on the nightstand so that my head can rest on the nightstand/pillow combination.  I put the goggles on (I put some white electric tape over the holes so that there is a reduction of red light coming through the goggles).  Sometimes, I will put on my iTunes &#x27;Pacific Ocean Sounds&#x27; in the background and just take a few deep breaths and relax.  My treatments are convenient and relaxing (very much like meditating).  I have been known to fall asleep and take long naps while under the lamp (greater than 20 minutes) with no major adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did notice that sometimes my skin and neck does get dry from using the RED MD light therapy but I suspect it is because I lay under the lamps for 2 sometimes even 3 hours (napping/sleeping).  Nevertheless, a good organic lotion (EveryDay Shea Butter in Vanilla from Whole Foods Market works splendid) and an exfoliating pad (Target Up Brand Exfoliating Pads) takes care of that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long review but my twin brother and I recommend this device wholeheartedly.  My twin brother ended up buying another RED MD lamp as well once he found out that I purchased two.  He also bought his for $199 so we joke that we both bought our lamps on the &#x27;dip.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this RED MD light therapy lamp gets a GREEN light!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all for nowherapy but I suspect it is because I lay under the lamps for 2 sometimes even 3 hours (napping/sleeping).

            <li> This is a very expensive device that does absolutley nothing for wrinkles and uneven skin.  A big waste of both money and time.  I used it for two months and took weekly photos of my skin so I could see the improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance over time.  There was no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> I just got the Red MD and I must say I am impressed by the results.  This is my first time trying a product like this and I have always been a bit skeptical about light therapy.  I order the Red MD after being promoted by a friend who is also using it.  To my surprise I have noticed a lessening in wrinkles  with regular use.  I like that when you use the Red MD you can leave it on a table and not have to move it around like other products I have heard of.  I have recomended  this product to several friends already.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the RedMD for about five weeks now.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe the beautiful difference the RedMD LED Anti-Aging Light Therapy Device has made for filling in lines and plumping up my skin.  I only wish that I had known about this device sooner!</li>
            <li> Only used it once, seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Did alot of reading about LED light therapy for various skin conditions and chose this brand and type because of the recommendations. Cant tell yet if its doing anything. I use it in conjunction with my Palvia laser, a PMD dermabrasion system, derma needling and a NuFace trinity microcurrent system. All part of a program to stave off the wrinkles and not have to pay a spa a gazillion dollars.</li>
            <li> i loved it at first, i think it works, is too expensive right now..i bought it for 200...but i like it, i just wish it had 2 panels for each side of my face!</li>
            <li> Just started. Used every evening for past 5 days. May be my imagination and/or wishful thinking but I believe I&#x27;ve already seen some improvements. Complexion looks more refreshed. Really excited for future results.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works, but each person should use it carefully and not assume that using it 20 minutes a day is safe. My skin improved but seems somewhat sensitive to the light. Therefore, I use it occasionally. The  lamp is a littler smaller than I thought, but it is of high quality.</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving the results. I&#x27;m finding it hard to sit still and meditate as long as is needed to get the results I want, but my Rosacea is disappearing! I was on two medicines (expensive) and they were only mildly controlling the breakouts. I would still flush bright red. I balked at first at the high price, but I am glad now I got this! I&#x27;m not smearing my face with chemicals with limited results anymore! Thank you!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT STARTED AT $199 NOW ITS $399!! THATS NOT RIGHT,.I BOUGHT THIS SAME PRODUCT AT ANOTHER SITE AND PAID $122 OVER ONE YEAR AGO</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months now and can honestly say I&#x27;m blown away by the results.  I began using the RedMD after I purchased the Baby Quasar, was less than thrilled with the results, and it was suggested that I give the Red MD a try. I was excited about it&#x27;s hands free capability which I thought would be a wonderful change from the hand-held Baby Quasar, and I was hopeful that the results would be something to write home about.(Ironically, it is the hands free ability that is my primary issue with this device.) But I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is a powerful piece of machinery. I had been using the Baby quasar (baby Q) on and off for months prior to receiving this product but never saw results that even came close to what I saw after the first use of the Red MD. Having said that, I can report that after just one use my skin looked splotchy, red, and a bit dry.  Somewhat concerned, but excited that I was seeing SOMETHING, I contacted customer service and was assured that this indicated that the product was working. I wasn&#x27;t convinced, but she assured me it was a good sign, but if I was concerned, to use the product less often in the beginning. I took her word for it and kept at it, though less frequently as suggested. To my amazement, I began seeing real results after about three weeks of continual use. My skin was rosier, clearer and generally looked healthier that it had in months.  Now, after roughly 5 months of using this product off and on, I can honestly say, this is the product I was looking for when I purchased the Baby Q years ago.  My skin looks better than it has in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one complaint about it, it would be the one thing I THOUGHT I was going to love the most: the hands free nature of the device.  Make no mistake about it, this thing is POWERFUL. (Seriously--don&#x27;t even think about using it without the goggles it comes with). Regardless, The goggles come with little transparent eye holes so you can still SEE while your using it but I can&#x27;t really &#x27;see&#x27; anything with this big round thing in front of my face.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but when I use it, I flip the light head up so that it&#x27;s parallel to my face and then I turn it on, wait my 20 minutes, then I&#x27;m done.  Well... there&#x27;s not too much you can do with a blazing light pallet in your face, so I&#x27;m just sitting there... anxiously...tapping..my...toes...waiting...for..it...too..be...finished...finally.  Plus, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s truly hands free because in order to keep it 6 inches from my face, I need to be holding the base.  So, despite the reviews I&#x27;ve read that complain about having to hold other products and move them around the face in 2 minute increments, I can only say, at least while I&#x27;m doing that I can still read a book or watch tv. It is REALLY difficult to sit still for 20 minutes doing NOTHING but sit there with my eyes closed--and I almost abandoned ship at the beginning of my trial for this reason. Eventually, (in light of the results I saw fairly quickly) I rationalized that it was kind of like when I used to go to the tanning salon back in the day.  After all, you just lay there for 20 minutes doing nothing, too.  If I could do it to ruin my skin, I could certainly do it to try to bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I held out because this product, and more importantly, the results I&#x27;ve received with it, have been well worth it. And that&#x27;s why I continue to use it today even though I cringe at the thought of sitting on my couch doing nothing while I&#x27;m receiving its benefits.  You won&#x27;t be sorry purchasing this device. It&#x27;s affordable and the results are amazing--and ultimately, that&#x27;s really all that matters to me!  Though...
