            <li>The smell is so nice and good .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s musky, and if musk isn&#x27;t your thing, this won&#x27;t win you over, but it has nice complementary tones that smell exotic, yet familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly nice scent and a great price!I will buy it again for sure, as a gift.</li>

            <li>Good perfume, all good, fast ship</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is sure to get you compliments.</li>
            <li>Have not found one I like better.</li>
            <li>the life is around six hours compared to Joop with is more like two days.</li>
            <li>this smells really cheap, it kind of smells like pee</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i tried it than i like it, i was at theater a lady asked me what is the name of this perfume i just give it to her than i told her get one for his man because all men who know perfume most get one</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li>I love this fragance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Not wispy and not too weak/faint or strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it comes on too strong.</li>
            <li>I get compliments EVERY TME I wear it, chicks love the manly scence... and specially...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice that the scent faded as others have mentioned, but I use cologne with the &amp;#34;spray, delay, walk away&amp;#34; method of application as I don&#x27;t want a saturation of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and a great price for a quality cologne with a unique, deep, fragrance</li>
            <li>The very first spray comes off strong but once it settles a bit, it goes to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dominant , and sexy .</li>
            <li>it smells good but does not last even an hour.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too strong at first.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!  </li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s not a super strong fragrance, yet it smells good and somehow &#x27;manly&#x27; (</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY NICE, VERY MASCULINE, BUT IR DOESNT LAST</li>
            <li>which is what I like the most, other fragrances such as One Million smell great too but in my opinion they lack a truly &#x27;manly&#x27; touch -</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know Banderas even made fragarences until I stumbled across his signature scent, and all told, his design house is very consistent for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>this one gets it right) .</li>
            <li>This scent is a bit strong at first, but mellows to a nice, complex cologne with strong notes of amber.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, I arrive at the expected time and is good perfume, are responsible.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it that much at first, but it sort of grew on me</li>
            <li>soft and smooth, almost like a babies arm holding a apple.</li>
            <li>The scent smelled nice compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, fresh and light, and still has a slight hint of dominance.</li>
            <li>Scent for strong and classy professional males .</li>
            <li>Those colognes are great in your college years, but this is more complex and smells less like dessert.</li>
            <li>Really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>THAT MUCH...</li>
            <li>hahahaha</li>
            <li>For that price range, this is way better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I received it and it smelled good but the box made a noise turns out part of it was broken.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and not at all fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li>Very masculine.</li>
            <li>Very noticible and extremely provacative .</li>

Very noticible and extremely provacative . Scent for strong and classy professional males . Great for the office or the Mrs .</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Exactly what i wanted. Excellent fragance. From Venezuela!</li>
            <li> I call this the peace de resistance. Let me break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a manly scent. Not fruity. Not wispy and not too weak/faint or strong or overpowering. The very first spray comes off strong but once it settles a bit, it goes to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the neck snapper, whiplash creator, chick magnet you should have in your collection.</li>
            <li> Really like this fragrance. It lasts all day and is sure to get you compliments. Give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> Have not found one I like better.</li>
            <li> meets expectations, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The scent fades away in a few hours. It is a bit too strong at first.</li>
            <li> I can not imagine a person hating the smell of this cologne I have over 40 bottles and this is one of the best smelling one. I don&#x27;t think it comes on too strong. the life is around six hours compared to Joop with is more like two days. I have to see how the sent develops after it seasons.​​​​</li>
            <li> I bought it for my fiance &amp; i love it!! 😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY NICE, VERY MASCULINE, BUT IR DOESNT LAST THAT MUCH... I LIKE IT THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS SIMILAR TO ONE MILLION BY PACO RABANNE</li>
            <li> This scent is a bit strong at first, but mellows to a nice, complex cologne with strong notes of amber. Very masculine and not at all fruity or flowery. Didn&#x27;t notice that the scent faded as others have mentioned, but I use cologne with the &amp;#34;spray, delay, walk away&amp;#34; method of application as I don&#x27;t want a saturation of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and a great price for a quality cologne with a unique, deep, fragrance</li>
            <li> Great smell, not overbearing.</li>
            <li> this smells really cheap, it kind of smells like pee that&#x27;s been sitting thing for weeks</li>
            <li> This is some good smelling stuff and for the money stands up to more costly bands.</li>
            <li> Very little scent...Have used this before and this has the same scent just a lot weaker. Doesnt last at all,maybe an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, I arrive at the expected time and is good perfume, are responsible.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit musky, but is a great scent for a woman to smell on her man. Very masculine. Love it.</li>
            <li> I hope buy this again.</li>
            <li> Hot selling excellent and very good product</li>
            <li> excelente producto, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> This is a manly scent, for manly men. It is not a fruity, for waxed body hair guys type of cologne. Those colognes are great in your college years, but this is more complex and smells less like dessert. It&#x27;s musky, and if musk isn&#x27;t your thing, this won&#x27;t win you over, but it has nice complementary tones that smell exotic, yet familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know Banderas even made fragarences until I stumbled across his signature scent, and all told, his design house is very consistent for a very reasonable price. Hard to find that combo.</li>
            <li> I received it and it smelled good but the box made a noise turns out part of it was broken. The scent smelled nice compared to other colognes. It was leaking over all but it was alright</li>

            <li> For that price range, this is way better than what I expected. Reminds me of one of my favorites eau de parfum 1million by Pacco Rabanne. Good stuff.</li>
