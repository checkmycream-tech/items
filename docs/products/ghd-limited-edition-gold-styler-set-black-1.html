            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>glad that i decided to spend more money on it</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>BUT it was not an authentic GHD product.</li>
            <li>My walmart iron straightened my hair better.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you now GHD is THE BEST hair iron you can possibly buy</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very nice, but somewhat large and I like to travel compact so never use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect, as expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>pretty packing, nice color, but don&#x27;t expect anything out of them...</li>
            <li>the carry bag is super cute.</li>
            <li>I bought the Boho Chic with the super cute bag.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing hair straightener and way better than my 5 year old one.</li>
            <li>Straightener does not have a hologram on the cord tag that a genuine GHD product would have.</li>
            <li>Does not work as we&#x27;ll as genuine product.</li>
            <li>If you have priced the GHD flat irons, you know this is a great price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Good luck and be sure you buy one directly from Amazon and not one supplied by an outside beauty supplier. :-)</li>
            <li>On this label is a unique code, which you can use to call GHD to make sure the straighteners are the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic, works far better that another styler that I had bought elsewhere.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT BURN YOUR HAIR, AND YOU CAN SEE A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE IRON ITSELF IN COMPARISSON TO OTHER STRAIGHTNING IRONS</li>
            <li>This iron is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t even get hot...</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>GHD straighteners are not the cheapest available but looking at them and from the results they achieve they are simply</li>
            <li>I spent more money  </li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I even let them heat up for about 30 minutes after they beeped that they were ready, and I could still touch them without even flinching...</li>
            <li>I was really apprehensive about buying it on Amazon after reading reviews of knock-offs and the inability to register on the ghd website, but this one had no issues.</li>
            <li>I have a hunch that this product is not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>Inside is a bag, that holds the product, which would retail for a few pounds on its own.</li>
            <li>This is my second ghd as the one I purchased in 2007 was destroyed in an auto accident last month, along with my car, so I knew what kind of product I was getting in advance.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it&#x27;s  the price but worth paying for this styler.</li>
            <li>I ended up trying  3 new ones and found that none compare</li>
            <li>It died - completely.</li>
            <li>maybe they didn&#x27;t buy it directly from amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li>This heats up immediately, works overseas, and cools down quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Results far exceed other styler and last much longer.</li>
            <li>The actual result is long lasting and they do not dull the hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also appeared to be brand new (not one that had been returned previously).</li>
            <li> My daughter stole our flat iron and went off to school.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last long for what it costs.</li>
            <li> I am going to return them and go into a beauty supply to get flat irons!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews for different GHD&#x27;s and they are like &#x27;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS -</li>
            <li> Be careful when purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is unacceptable, this product is very expensive and is clearly not as described as an original product from GHD.</li>
            <li> have bought them to amazon, not to other sellers.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A FAKE&#x27; and all this stuff that wasn&#x27;t very  encouraging</li>
            <li> I can style in just a few minutes and it lasts a couple of days even without any products other than just a drop of heat treatment cream.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a short life.</li>
            <li> I tried to go the less expensive route first as I am on a budget, but after two tries with other well rated products, my disappointment and yanked out hair led me to invest the extra bucks in the ghd.</li>
            <li> Heats up in just few seconds.</li>
            <li> ordered these for the future Mrs C, as unfortunately my hair does not need straighteners.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing GHD products for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have longish thick somewhat wavy hair</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon is considerably less expensive than the $225 you would pay from Sephora or off the ghd website.</li>
            <li> I suspect it is a fake.</li>
            <li> a fake one&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> Also for those who have bought real or fake GHD straighteners</li>
            <li> so disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Straightener does not have a hologram on the cord tag that a genuine GHD product would have. Be sure to validate the date code and cord hologram code on the GHD website to verify authenticity.</li>
            <li> It died - completely. I had it about 2 months. I didn&#x27;t travel with it. It just stayed in my bathroom. After about two months it didn&#x27;t turn on. I tried different outlet - I looked for customer service help. This was my second GHD iron. Love GHD for the styling but I won&#x27;t buy one again. Too expensive for such a short life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a certified cosmetologist and I will only use GHD flat irons. I still have one I got in school and it works perfectly, but needed one for home. Comes with a warranty and the carry bag is super cute. This iron is worth the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. DOES NOT BURN YOUR HAIR, AND YOU CAN SEE A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE IRON ITSELF IN COMPARISSON TO OTHER STRAIGHTNING IRONS</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product - It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  The product and accessories I ordered were what I received.  There were no surprises.</li>
            <li> This product does not have the official tag on the power cord and does not close correctly. I suspect it is a fake. There is no option to &amp;#34;contact us&amp;#34; to confirm so I contacted GHD who won&#x27;t comment without the tag number. Expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> They are perfect, so beautiful and very nice quality. I have already registered them in the oficial web page, and they are completly original.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend them 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought them to amazon, not to other sellers.</li>
            <li> GHD straighteners are not the cheapest available but looking at them and from the results they achieve they are simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these for the future Mrs C, as unfortunately my hair does not need straighteners. I am told by my good lady that they are everything the cheaper models are not. The plates do not catch and the hair glides through without any problems. The actual result is long lasting and they do not dull the hair. I am told that they are the best set of straighteners that she has ever used. The only downside is that they do seem to be somewhat fragile and are not as robust as some on the market and so care in storage is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come packaged in a beautiful box. Inside is a bag, that holds the product, which would retail for a few pounds on its own. Everything about the presentation of this product wreaks of quality. Also for those who have bought real or fake GHD straighteners there is a hologram label on the electric wire to tell which is which. On this label is a unique code, which you can use to call GHD to make sure the straighteners are the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am told that they are great and the best set of straighteners you can buy for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> came in a GHD bag with all the product codes and a very cute clutchy looking bag that i gave a friend for use as a clutchbag .Product as specified, happy with my purchase and the packaging was gorgeous too</li>
            <li> Fantastic, works far better that another styler that I had bought elsewhere.Results far exceed other styler and last much longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect, as expected!</li>
            <li> Beautiful item, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My daughter stole our flat iron and went off to school.  I ended up trying  3 new ones and found that none compare&lt;br /&gt;So I spent more money  but it works!</li>
            <li> Amazing and very nice easy to use practical in travel as well I recommended it to all females ,it protects the hair from any damage thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair straightener and way better than my 5 year old one. This heats up immediately, works overseas, and cools down quickly as well. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> it is the best styler so far that i had! glad that i decided to spend more money on it</li>
            <li> I love this iron. It&#x60;s incredible...You can to have a beautiful curly or straight hair! It&#x60;s easy to use. The only problem is it&#x27;s  the price but worth paying for this styler.</li>
            <li> I bought this one before one month and i have tried for five times.. It was realy greaaat . My hair become softer than before . And i can finish all my hair in short time . I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  A friend let me borrow hers a work one day and I was sold.  I bought the Boho Chic with the super cute bag.  If you have priced the GHD flat irons, you know this is a great price.</li>
            <li> just got this beauty a month ago and i most say&lt;br /&gt;it works perfect, i work doing keratin treatments&lt;br /&gt;at lease  3 times at week  and it works perfect&lt;br /&gt;i see that somebody here had a fake one&lt;br /&gt;but maybe they didn&#x27;t buy it directly from amazon&lt;br /&gt;sorry for u my works perfect</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t even get hot... they get warm...pretty packing, nice color, but don&#x27;t expect anything out of them...I even let them heat up for about 30 minutes after they beeped that they were ready, and I could still touch them without even flinching... so disappointed in this product... I am going to return them and go into a beauty supply to get flat irons!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I love it!! It works great and is authentic too...I was able to register it on manufacturers website which was great!!! There are a lot fakes out there so &amp;#34;Buyer Beware...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Everything about this product looked great BUT it was not an authentic GHD product. Be careful when purchasing. Does not work as we&#x27;ll as genuine product.</li>
            <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
            <li> Further to other complaints from customers regarding registering this product with GHD as a GENUINE GHD product I wish to register my complaint.  This product does not have a product code as required and described by Amazon.  This is unacceptable, this product is very expensive and is clearly not as described as an original product from GHD.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Was expecting the best result ever since I paid the greatest price ever. My walmart iron straightened my hair better. It pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t give me the result I wanted at all.</li>
            <li> the straightener item didn&#x27;t work when i plugged it and tried to start it as instructed in the instructions booklet</li>
            <li> El artículo es bueno y funciona con normalidad, y viene bien equipado, con accesorios de planchado, espero haber ayudado en la decisión de compra, gracias.</li>
            <li> I received my ghd in the mail today! I was really apprehensive about buying it on Amazon after reading reviews of knock-offs and the inability to register on the ghd website, but this one had no issues. I registered using the number and date code from the hologram on the inside of the handle and it was accepted and registered without a problem. It also appeared to be brand new (not one that had been returned previously). This is my second ghd as the one I purchased in 2007 was destroyed in an auto accident last month, along with my car, so I knew what kind of product I was getting in advance. I tried to go the less expensive route first as I am on a budget, but after two tries with other well rated products, my disappointment and yanked out hair led me to invest the extra bucks in the ghd. Also, Amazon is considerably less expensive than the $225 you would pay from Sephora or off the ghd website. Good luck and be sure you buy one directly from Amazon and not one supplied by an outside beauty supplier. :-)</li>
            <li> I recommend this product 100%!!!! I read other reviews for different GHD&#x27;s and they are like &#x27;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS - IT&#x27;S A FAKE&#x27; and all this stuff that wasn&#x27;t very  encouraging, this product didn&#x27;t so I decided to give it a shot and yippee it&#x27;s GREAT!!!!! I was chuffed when it turned up all nicely wrapped great bag, and everything there... and fantastic...!!! I registered it on the GHD website and it all worked... HOORAY!!!! I have had one before and I can tell you now GHD is THE BEST hair iron you can possibly buy and it&#x27;s GREAT!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I say &#x27;Get this one&#x27;... and I&#x27;ll repeat it again &#x27;Get this one&#x27;... it&#x27;s so cool!!! HAVE FUN WITH YOU GHD!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Heats up in just few seconds. I have longish thick somewhat wavy hair and I use it to both to straighten and curl. I can style in just a few minutes and it lasts a couple of days even without any products other than just a drop of heat treatment cream. The carrying case is very nice, but somewhat large and I like to travel compact so never use it. Great buy! Hopefully it will last long for what it costs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, fast and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and I can make all kinds of hairstyles</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing GHD products for the past 5 years. I got this iron to replace the one that died after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as a GHD usually does. I have a hunch that this product is not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it from an official source instead!</li>
