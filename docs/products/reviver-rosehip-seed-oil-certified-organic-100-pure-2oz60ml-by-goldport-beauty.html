            <li>, i think this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because Rosehip Seed Oil is so good for your skin.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal for the amount of oil you get.</li>
            <li>so it is premature to give a fair rating from my perspective.</li>
            <li>I did give this product a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li>She is very pleased and I am as well.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Rose Hip Seed oil and this did not feel or smell like that.</li>
            <li>I was exposed to rose hip oil in Arizona...for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am now using it on some of my own scarring to see what it does.</li>
            <li>Very light on the skin, never leave home without it on.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is organic</li>
            <li>i love this oil.</li>
            <li>ive never used rosehip seed oil before, and from what ive read they all have an interesting smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and has really made a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and what a difference</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells more to olive oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>As for noticing a decrease in fine lines-</li>
            <li>It helps with signs of aging, help repair sun damage skin, and the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have bought from this company many times they are quick and dependable. .</li>
            <li>i love the fact that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily shine on my face.</li>
            <li>it is too soon to give an accurate appraisal</li>
            <li>just apply this rosehip seed oil to my cleansed face the smooth on my foundation over it .By</li>
            <li>Originally purchased for my mom.  </li>
            <li>Great oil, I use it with other oils for my body, face and hair works miracle..</li>
            <li>I do use a mild  pineapple and papaya enzyme peel and a vegan hyaluronic acid serum</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would decrease some fine facial wrinkles---but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much improvement if any.  </li>
            <li>while i don&#x27;t have alot of those issues yet, i wanted to take preventative measures:) i had been using jojoba oil before this, and while that was ok, i found it actually did make my acne worse (even though i read many things saying jojoba is actually good for acne).</li>
            <li>oily feel of this serum is absorbed with in twenty minutes</li>
            <li>It absorbed right in</li>
            <li>I found out about rosehip seed oil on the Dr. Oz show and was interested in getting some to treat my daughter mild case of eczema and it worked immediately.</li>
            <li>Soft oil, easy to put it on the face</li>
            <li>so i started using only this as my moisurizer, and my acne got better.</li>
            <li>I went through the first bottle in no time.  </li>
            <li>When I do use it consistently, I do notice a change in the softness of my face.  </li>
            <li>but when I run out I will definitely purchase more of it from this seller.</li>
            <li>and it really makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>it smells funny, but i guess thats normal.</li>
            <li>well, I guess I haven&#x27;t paid that much</li>
            <li>Will buy again very soon.</li>
            <li>I use warm water and put a few drops in my hands and apply it to my face and my surgery scare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand for years .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I no longer use any other moisturizers because I had developed fine wrinkles around my eyes rather quickly while using a new( and very expensive)moisturizer several years ago</li>
            <li>It is such a nice texture but a little too oily to wear under makeup during the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 27 and try not to criticize my face too much!      </li>
            <li>However, the oil was a clear color</li>
            <li>and my hand feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Another dissapointing thing is there is no way of knowing how old this oil is, and rosehip seed oil goes rancid within 12-18 months.</li>
            <li>The second shipment had a much stronger smell to it...</li>
            <li>I HAVE MATURE SKIN</li>
            <li>but I really like it for a facial moisturizer enhancer.</li>
            <li>It began to disappear after days of using the product and within 10 days was completely gone by using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>(so i know it was not rancid) and after using it for about a week it is helping my acne scars slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>not completely gone, i suspect i&#x27;ll struggle with adult acne forever:/ but for any woman wanting to moisturize naturally, prevent or even try to erase wrinkles (don&#x27;t know if it really does,</li>
            <li>I was a little dissapointed by the packaging which was a plastic bottle (it was atleast amber though) and a very cheap label that contained absolutely no information (all it said was rose-hip).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it really works</li>
            <li>My face went red and got so terribly sensitive like never before.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like using a organic product on my face over none. Sometime back I saw a women with a scar on her face she used Rosehip Seed oil on her scar for sometime and scar disappeared. I have used lotions on my face sense I was 16. As I have aged my skin has gotten dryer. I need a stronger oil or lotion it improves the look and feel of my dry skin. I have bought from this company many times they are quick and dependable. .</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I bought this oil for some recipes for skin treatments that I am trying. I tried a little drop on the back of my hand. It absorbed right in and my hand feels soft and silky. I love that this product is organic and I didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot to get it! I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Rose Hip Seed oil and this did not feel or smell like that. It seemed like a smelly vegetable oil. Not sure whether the fault lies in the manufacturer or the product was tampered with by the seller (halaldirect)</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed by the packaging which was a plastic bottle (it was atleast amber though) and a very cheap label that contained absolutely no information (all it said was rose-hip). However, the oil was a clear color (so i know it was not rancid) and after using it for about a week it is helping my acne scars slowly but surely. I did transfer it into glass bottles though. Another dissapointing thing is there is no way of knowing how old this oil is, and rosehip seed oil goes rancid within 12-18 months. I added some vitamin E and evening primrose oil as a preservative, and keep it refrigerated.</li>
            <li> i love this oil. it smells funny, but i guess thats normal. ive never used rosehip seed oil before, and from what ive read they all have an interesting smell. i read this was good for skin, wrinkles and discoloration. while i don&#x27;t have alot of those issues yet, i wanted to take preventative measures:) i had been using jojoba oil before this, and while that was ok, i found it actually did make my acne worse (even though i read many things saying jojoba is actually good for acne). so i started using only this as my moisurizer, and my acne got better. not completely gone, i suspect i&#x27;ll struggle with adult acne forever:/ but for any woman wanting to moisturize naturally, prevent or even try to erase wrinkles (don&#x27;t know if it really does, like i said, i don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet) and that may still have acne even in adulthood, i think this is a good choice. it works for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item a few times from this supplier after my aesthetician nmentioned I had some dry spots on my face.    I went through the first bottle in no time.  The second shipment had a much stronger smell to it... so it&#x27;s been harder to get through.    When I do use it consistently, I do notice a change in the softness of my face.  Bought a bottle for my mother (54) and she has noticed the same.    As for noticing a decrease in fine lines- well, I guess I haven&#x27;t paid that much attention-- I&#x27;m only 27 and try not to criticize my face too much!      If you have some dry spots- this stuff will help.  Haven&#x27;t used any other rosehips so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  I use it for my face, hands, hair...</li>
            <li> Great oil, I use it with other oils for my body, face and hair works miracle..</li>
            <li> I HAVE MATURE SKIN AND IT MAKES LOOK GREAT.  THE WRINKLES ARE SOFTENED AND SKIN LOOKS DEWEY.  MY SKIN HAS IMPROVED GREATLY,  THIS IS SECOND BOTTLE I AM USING</li>
            <li> This is smooth and silky with an amazing aroma, just what  i needed to make a serum, the price wasn&#x27;t horrific</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m allergic to it.  My face went red and got so terribly sensitive like never before.</li>
            <li> I was exposed to rose hip oil in Arizona...for wrinkles. Bought this bottle but have moved on to a different product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and has really made a difference to my skin. I recommend two drops each morning and night.</li>
            <li> Ordered it because it is supposed to be one of the best wrinkle &amp;#34;fixers&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it really works but I&#x27;m using it and hope it does.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very light on the skin, never leave home without it on. Thank you. Will buy again very soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because Rosehip Seed Oil is so good for your skin. It helps with signs of aging, help repair sun damage skin, and the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I happy to find this product. It&#x27;s cold pressed and it has a convenient dropper. This was a good deal for the amount of oil you get. I know this will last me a long time but when I run out I will definitely purchase more of it from this seller.</li>
            <li> I just purchased rose-hip seed oil so it is premature to give a fair rating from my perspective. I am using it on scars from surgery and in 7 days it is too soon to give an accurate appraisal</li>
            <li> It can be used for just about anything but I really like it for a facial moisturizer enhancer. Just a drop or two and it really makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li> Cold pressed rosehip seed oil is almost like a fountain of youth. Feels great, soothes irritated skin, diminishes wrinkles and scarring. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil has been amazing for my skin! I have been peeling pretty bad from sun damage. This solved the problem! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels and what a difference it is making on/ in my skin. will be using on my hair too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand for years . I look younger now than I did 15 years ago !! I don&#x27;t have saggy skin under my chin or above my eyes . I only use vitamin &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; oil and aloe vera with it .I just apply this rosehip seed oil to my cleansed face the smooth on my foundation over it .By the time I get to work , my skin is no longer shiny ..I no longer use any other moisturizers because I had developed fine wrinkles around my eyes rather quickly while using a new( and very expensive)moisturizer several years ago .Now,even the deep wrinkles on my forehead are hardly noticeable . I do use a mild  pineapple and papaya enzyme peel and a vegan hyaluronic acid serum .The oily feel of this serum is absorbed with in twenty minutes and I haven&#x27;t been getting acne .The pores on my nose have decreased considerably ( I don&#x27;t use vitamin E on my nose but I do use this rosehip seed oil) . If any of you use retinol ( I never do ) ----do not go out in the sun for three  days !!!!!!!! I wish I had known that years ago !!</li>
            <li> Great used as moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have not seen improvement in my scar. Use the product as it as instructed and have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li> I found out about rosehip seed oil on the Dr. Oz show and was interested in getting some to treat my daughter mild case of eczema and it worked immediately. It began to disappear after days of using the product and within 10 days was completely gone by using it twice a day. Love this stuff. I will always keep a bottle in my house. I am now using it on some of my own scarring to see what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little dissapointed the product containing not believe what he says. Smells more to olive oil.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased for my mom.  She has been using the product on her facial age spots and they are disappearing.  She is very pleased and I am as well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would decrease some fine facial wrinkles---but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much improvement if any.  I did give this product a fair amount of time.  I think I went thru 2 bottles---but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product was featured on Dr. OZ as one of his remedies for youthful looking skin.  He recommended a drop or two in your moisturizer 2 times a day to help remove imperfections and keep your skin moisturized while preventing wrinkles.  It is such a nice texture but a little too oily to wear under makeup during the day.  I use it in the evening before bed.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I found this product listed on a site I belong to and it said this is great for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since I received it, time will tell.  I use warm water and put a few drops in my hands and apply it to my face and my surgery scare.  May want to check back with me at a later date to see my thoughts at that time too.</li>
            <li> i use this product everyday, and highly recommend it for smoother skin. i love the fact that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily shine on my face.</li>
            <li> Soft oil, easy to put it on the face</li>
