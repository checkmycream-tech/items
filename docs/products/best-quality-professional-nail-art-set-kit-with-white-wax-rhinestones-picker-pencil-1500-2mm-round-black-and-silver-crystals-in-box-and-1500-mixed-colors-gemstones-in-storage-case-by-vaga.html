            <li>It goes great with any mani or pedi nail art that I&#x27;ve done &amp; the pencil makes it so easy to pick up the tiny rhinestones!</li>

            <li>&amp; I only gave 2 stars because they came early &amp;&amp; they&#x27;re cute!&lt;br</li>
            <li>did a whole nail of them and finished only half of 1 compartment.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with my purchase however the boxes do appear to be smaller than pictured and there are definitely less rhinestones. Great variety of colors. Have yet to put them to use but they look great</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t stopped buying these things and she seems happy doing her own nails and her sisters</li>
            <li> Well it did come a few days early.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it and think you&#x27;re going to have 5000 rhinestones!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because I didn&#x27;t receive what&#x27;s in the description!&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing anything else from cheeky beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; I only gave 2 stars because they came early &amp;&amp; they&#x27;re cute!&lt;br /&gt;Guess you get what you paid for!&lt;br /&gt;FALSE ADVERTISING!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Thought there would be more stones in the boxes but still good amount. Only problem is the lids are extremely hard to open.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Tons of gems! This will keep me busy for years! Took a while for delivery but arrived safe.</li>
            <li> Just like picture. N the pencil works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my clients nails they love them... came early than expected date. now the other staff members want to order one for them...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Gems were mixed together,or came out of individual dividers and were loose in the pastic packaging. Gems were way smaller than I anticipated</li>
            <li> Horrible! Just horrible&lt;br /&gt; I ordered this because it said 2000 rhinestones. There may be 100 in the colors and 2 or 3 hundred in the clear and black.  In the colored stones there&#x27;s pieces of colored plastic. Are they counting that as a stone? Just very disappointed for waiting a month n a half for this!</li>
            <li> I love these rhinestones but the container is so difficult to open. My nails are weak so I have to have a friend open it if I want to use them without breaking my nails. I&#x27;m going to be getting someone different to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent seller</li>
            <li> The lids were so hard to open.</li>
