            <li>I have not used it yet, but I can only assume it will work great for me.  </li>

            <li>This hot brush did not become hot enough to do it good.</li>
            <li>It is nice for very short hair.</li>
            <li>Just the right size barrel</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my new hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I have thin semi straight hair and this blower is awesome!</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>After getting a too short haircut from a new hairdresser, I purchased this hot brush to use in place of my old curling iron, it works great</li>
            <li>I was looking under Hot Air Brush driers.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot and burn my fingers or my hair.  </li>
            <li>This hot curling brush does not heat to hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li>I thought it was a hot air</li>
            <li>My wife had a Conair hot air curler that quit working.  </li>
            <li>Her&#x27;s was one that used hot air as a heat source.  </li>
            <li>This item was with a number of others listed as hot air brushes, but it is not.  </li>
            <li>I usually have good luck with Conair products, but I returned this one.</li>
            <li>Not that easy to find this item in local stores in the 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this brush from a local store because my previous Conair hot brush had worked perfectly for 7+ years.  </li>
            <li>Because I have fine hair it needs to be much smaller!</li>
            <li>It drys my hair fast and gives it tons of body and shine.</li>
            <li>seems to work very well</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and always had good results with the older model.</li>
            <li>This new model must have been modified, because the heat settings are different now and the metal roller never gets hot enough to do a good, lasting curl even on the hottest setting.  </li>
            <li>Find grippy roller for 3 minutes does a better job and less work.</li>
            <li>I have an older version of this curling brush and wanted a spare to take with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find one at Amazon ,  as I had been unable to find one in a store.</li>
            <li>They sent me the new style with tipped ends and 25 heat settings.  </li>
            <li>The brush &#x27;comb&#x27; is exactly the length I was looking for however, the product does not get hot enough for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I have to leave it on the max 10 to get any heat hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough nor  does it curl...</li>
            <li>but I barely use it as I have curly hair and so doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to curl my hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough, but it takes awhile to warm up.</li>
            <li>The picture in the advertisement shows the old style but that&#x27;s not what they send out.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the same model as this Hot brush prior to this order &amp; found it to be of the same quality as the VS.</li>

            <li> I also searched endlessly for this style of curling brush, which is what I am currently using...</li>
            <li> It got intangled in my hair and i had to pull some of my hair out to get loose.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair 3/4 curling brushes for several years, but this one does not curl my short hair as well as others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Nothing really wrong with it, except perhaps that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as such appliances used to.  </li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of time.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a hair dryer/curler.  </li>
            <li> It did not do what i expected.  </li>
            <li> I did not catch that this one was not Hot Air.</li>
            <li> Searched endlessly for the \\&quot;old\\&quot; style heat brush with the untipped ends and 2 heat settings.  </li>
            <li> This one I will keep in my overnite bag &amp; the other for every day use.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> not good, doesn&#x27;t work on short or long hair.</li>
            <li> The supply voltage is 220 Volts I had to purchase another step down transformer.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another Revlon curler lime the previous one I had to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Waste of money I just had to throw it out</li>
            <li> wasted money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I neglected to read the other customer review before ordering as I, too, received a totally different brush than was pictured and described...</li>
            <li> No happy with how long it takes to heat up.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, as I&#x27;ve has Conair hot curling brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> hard to find these types of curling utensils.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> This size is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad product come from Conair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> disappointed in the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> After getting a too short haircut from a new hairdresser, I purchased this hot brush to use in place of my old curling iron, it works great and I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> No happy with how long it takes to heat up. I have to leave it on the max 10 to get any heat hot enough to use. I would not recommend this product. I had to buy another Revlon curler lime the previous one I had to replace this one. He has way better settings, and it heats up quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough, but it takes awhile to warm up.</li>
            <li> My hair got dangled every time in I have tried to use this...I don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> only used once. It got intangled in my hair and i had to pull some of my hair out to get loose.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, but I can only assume it will work great for me.  I was happy to find one at Amazon ,  as I had been unable to find one in a store.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the heating element of this product.  I have used Conair 3/4 curling brushes for several years, but this one does not curl my short hair as well as others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this brush from a local store because my previous Conair hot brush had worked perfectly for 7+ years.  This new model must have been modified, because the heat settings are different now and the metal roller never gets hot enough to do a good, lasting curl even on the hottest setting.  I have thick wavy hair and always had good results with the older model.</li>
            <li> this is not a blower, which is what i was looking for</li>
            <li> bought by my wife . very happy . exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li> Great product, travels well</li>
            <li> I like Conair Products. I have a couple of 3/4 curling irons. One for home, one for travel. I have no problems with this product. I like the auto turnoff because I get in a hurry and…..well you know the story.</li>
            <li> Does not get very warm.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> seems to work very well</li>
            <li> Very good curling iron.</li>
            <li> It did not do what i expected.  I thought it was a hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the results</li>
            <li> Nothing really wrong with it, except perhaps that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as such appliances used to.  Other than that, it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable.</li>
            <li> You did not specify that the operating voltage was 120 volt! The supply voltage is 220 Volts I had to purchase another step down transformer.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what i needed! Had been recommended by a friend, and Amazon was the perfect choice and best price!</li>
            <li> This hot brush did not become hot enough to do it good.</li>
            <li> not good, doesn&#x27;t work on short or long hair. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough nor  does it curl... wasted money.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be helpful to create lift on crown of short head of hair.  Find grippy roller for 3 minutes does a better job and less work.</li>
            <li> It is nice for very short hair.</li>
            <li> Just the right size barrel</li>
            <li> I purchased this one a while ago but I barely use it as I have curly hair and so doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair. Maybe with a fine hair could work!</li>
            <li> Works great for short hair like mine</li>
            <li> My wife had a Conair hot air curler that quit working.  She asked me to go on line and find another for her.  Her&#x27;s was one that used hot air as a heat source.  This item was with a number of others listed as hot air brushes, but it is not.  Just a heat element that heats the hair for curling.  She wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this item, and has since found what she wanted.  She&#x27;s keeping this one as a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Thank you</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to curl my hair</li>
            <li> I have had it for a while now and I am still using it, it was cheap but it does work very good !</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my old curling brush. Could be a bit longer, but otherwise works well and meets my need.</li>
            <li> great for my shorter hair - worked so well that I bought 2 more in case this one ever wears out.  This size is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my short hair in back and front.  Heats up quickly. I have never had a bad product come from Conair.</li>
            <li> The brush &#x27;comb&#x27; is exactly the length I was looking for however, the product does not get hot enough for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this curler. Heats quickly and is temperature adjustable. Perfect for my medium short hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and at a great price. Thank you so very much. Speedy delivery too!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> Conaire should be ashamed to have their name on this product</li>
            <li> Excellent value. It has 10 heat settings, which I don&#x27;t think was mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li> Not like it, it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my new hair brush.  I did find that I have had to turn the heat up all the way to get a great curl.</li>
