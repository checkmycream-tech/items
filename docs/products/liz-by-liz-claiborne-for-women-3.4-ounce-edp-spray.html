            <li>Perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>but I was so happy when I found it online!</li>
            <li>A great buy indeed!</li>

            <li>The supplier was great, the perfume is awesome, and the price was very good.</li>
            <li>This is a great daytime or work perfume.</li>
            <li>every time i put this on i get great responses from both men and women</li>
            <li>Great price for this size</li>
            <li>and I was extremely happy to find it since they no longer sell in stores</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Excellent love this fragrance</li>

            <li>Omg I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when wearing it!</li>
            <li>However, I doubt that I would replace my bottle -- there are just too many good fumes out there that are bottle-worthy, even at this price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very NICE.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a light scent but don&#x27;t want to keep reapplying body spray, this is an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li>My  wife liked it and so did I.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it on the shelves very easily.  </li>
            <li>NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz is light and airy which makes LC Liz a good choice for the office &amp; for summer.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best perfume a woman could ever buy and wear.</li>
            <li>When I bought this it came exactly as promised and smelled great</li>
            <li>It smells very cheap to me.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>me, Liz wears more like a fruity floral or a floral aquatic than an oriental floral.</li>
            <li>I catch pepper or paprika on top -- reminds me of Lanvin Oxygene.</li>
            <li>I look forward to buying more.</li>
            <li>Its my daughters favorite.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the price was great.  </li>

            <li>I really enjoy most Liz Claiborne scents...</li>
            <li>Love the smell, it unique.</li>
            <li>Niceness rarely is the quality of a love-love fume, but it&#x27;s fitting for this likable value</li>
            <li>There is a strong overtone of citrus.</li>
            <li>This is a light scent w/ a clean finish.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find and what a GREAT price!</li>
            <li>both men &amp; women always say \\&quot;You smell wonderful!\\&quot; or \\&quot;What a fresh clean scent!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The smell last long.its nice.</li>
            <li>I had good expectations based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>She really liked the extra large size.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li>It opens alot like LC Bora Bora -- they are definitely sisters at the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real thing!</li>
            <li>This fragrance Liz it has such a light and fresh aroma and you can wear it during daytime or at night.</li>
            <li>Usually everyone says how wonderful I smell--all day long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy but still subtle and office appropriate.</li>
            <li>I would have rated five stars but for some reason the perfume&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t as strong &amp; lasting as it is when I bought it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much floral.</li>
            <li>decided after searching for this perfume and the REAL perfume not this imitation that the product this company is selling is not the authentic perfume.</li>
            <li>Sweet, strong long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>but I have to reapply more than a few times a day.  </li>
            <li>It is such a pretty floral scent</li>
            <li>It would also be good for a casual evening out.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this fragrance I was actually wanting a different one.  </li>
            <li>Tonight I decided to search and it seems this is one of the very few who seem to have it available.</li>

            <li> This fragrance Liz it has such a light and fresh aroma and you can wear it during daytime or at night.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It is my go to scent.</li>
            <li> NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the one word which best characterizes LC Liz. Niceness rarely is the quality of a love-love fume, but it&#x27;s fitting for this likable value fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, Liz wears more like a fruity floral or a floral aquatic than an oriental floral. It opens alot like LC Bora Bora -- they are definitely sisters at the top. I catch pepper or paprika on top -- reminds me of Lanvin Oxygene. The pear &amp; melon are mellow &amp; comforting -- reminds me of Paris Hilton. Add in the peony -- it&#x27;s like Burberry Brit. Then Liz gets a bit watery (water lily or lotus flower?) -- similar to Sung&#x27;s Shi.  The bottom (vanilla, amber) is not strong enough for my taste but is long lasting. Not unique imo, but NICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz is light and airy which makes LC Liz a good choice for the office &amp; for summer. I like Liz - alot. However, I doubt that I would replace my bottle -- there are just too many good fumes out there that are bottle-worthy, even at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the falcon collectors &amp; design students out there, the asymmetric waviness on the bottle is a grip. I&#x27;m medium-sized woman, and the 100ml bottle fits my hand perfectly. The bottle itself is only about 1\\&quot; (25mm) deep. Although plain, the box is not wasteful -- it&#x27;s compact &amp; eco-friendly. Inside the box, \\&quot;Liz\\&quot; is laser-cut on dark lavender packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very NICE.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this fragrance! Sweet, strong long lasting smell. I look forward to buying more.</li>
            <li> About four years ago my mother happen to buy this for me at a discount store for Christmas. Since then I have had numerous compliments from males and females. I just knew I had to stick with this perfume. I love it!! I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Smells great, large bottle and amazing price!! You can&#x27;t beat that! It stays on all day on me. I use it during the day to shop or run errands. Perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Cant find this product in my area. Its my daughters favorite. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great daytime or work perfume. It&#x27;s sexy but still subtle and office appropriate. It would also be good for a casual evening out.</li>
            <li> I looooooove this perfume. It is such a pretty floral scent and I get many compliments when wearing it! I really enjoy most Liz Claiborne scents...and this is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the price was great.  Much less inexpensive than buying it in a store.  I would have rated five stars but for some reason the perfume&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t as strong &amp; lasting as it is when I bought it in the stores.  I don&#x27;t know why but I have to reapply more than a few times a day.  It just doesn&#x27;t last. The last few bottles I purchased in store lasted me a very long time and I hardly ever had to reapply.  When I bought this it came exactly as promised and smelled great but the smell is not long lasting which is a disappointment.  Maybe I just got a bad bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Updated review* 2/20/13&lt;br /&gt;I decided after searching for this perfume and the REAL perfume not this imitation that the product this company is selling is not the authentic perfume. I can no longer find this perfume in Marshall&#x27;s, TJ Maxx. Tonight I decided to search and it seems this is one of the very few who seem to have it available. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to purchase this knock off again. It&#x27;s simply like scented water. Such a scam. It probably cost them 2 bucks to make a knock off product of scented water.. You are paying $30 or more.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.. Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s not the real thing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this perfume and always get compliments when I wear it.  The supplier was great, the perfume is awesome, and the price was very good.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best perfume a woman could ever buy and wear. every time i put this on i get great responses from both men and women you wont regret this purchase</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this fragrance I was actually wanting a different one.  My aunt suggested I try Liz, I did and I have been wearing it ever since.  This is a light scent w/ a clean finish.  Not over-powering at all.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  I can no longer find it in Macy&#x27;s but I was so happy when I found it online!</li>
            <li> Excellent love this fragrance😁</li>
            <li> Get a lot of compliments when I wear Liz.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, the worst fragrance from Liz I have ever purchased. I have worn one after another of Liz Claiborne scents for over 25 years and I was really disappointed by this one. When I first saw this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to me, I followed the reviews and unfortunately, now I know they were wrong. My daughter who is a teen and &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; all and everything I wear calls this the &amp;#34;old lady water&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve even tried to give it away to some friends but no takers. I would of returned it but I lost the return shipping information. Guess I&#x27;ll send it to the Salvation Army with my next donation of clothing.</li>
            <li> Great price for this size and I was extremely happy to find it since they no longer sell in stores</li>
            <li> The smell last long.its nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance.  My wife use it exclusively.  She gives it 5 stars!  The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> broguht this for my mom she loves Liz Claiborne products and Eliz Taylor brought it for around Christmas though so she like it and still have it she have so many bottles of perfume</li>
            <li> I had good expectations based on other reviews.  I truly do not like this scent.  It smells very cheap to me. Granted, it was only $15 bucks.  It is not very sweet.  There is a strong overtone of citrus. I don&#x27;t smell much floral. It actually irritates my nose/throat if I wear it. I took a chance buying without ever smelling because of the price and reviews.  Hopefully I can find a friend who likes it and give it away.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a light scent but don&#x27;t want to keep reapplying body spray, this is an excellent choice.  Can&#x27;t find it on the shelves very easily.  Arrived in good packaging, on time, as described.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume, Liz, for 2 years and I am wondering what is different..EDP? Usually everyone says how wonderful I smell--all day long! With this bottle I can&#x27;t even smell it after 2 miniutes!!!!!!!!!!!! I am bummed with this purchase but do not know what it is that has changed? Maybe I bought the \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; before? I just don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> My  wife liked it and so did I.</li>
            <li> Sent order out promptly. Arrived within expected timeframe.</li>
            <li> I will never stop wearing Liz!  I get daily compliments...both men &amp; women always say \\&quot;You smell wonderful!\\&quot; or \\&quot;What a fresh clean scent!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Its my daughters favorite and she quite enjoys it!!  She really liked the extra large size. A great buy indeed!</li>
            <li> Hard to find and what a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> Still as I remember. Smell last a long time. Still a great scent! Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> No problems with ordering or receiving product. One of my favorite perfumes and being able to find it was a plus for me. I will be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, it unique.</li>
