            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>Leaves hair super soft and smelling so good!</li>
            <li>Product is non-greasy and leaves hair with a smooth texture as it protects from heat damage.  </li>
            <li>This helps smooth out the frizzys.</li>
            <li>so I have to use a lot and this kind lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair smooth, shiny and silky after I blow-dry.</li>
            <li>how smooth and sleek it looks after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>This is a great blow dry spray.  </li>

            <li>Cuts drying time and leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>works great, reduced fizz and dry time!</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it had a nice, clean scent, but as it stands, the scent just reminds of old ladies&#x27; hair</li>
            <li>See other review on the 3-pack of &amp;#34;My Amazing Blow Dry Secret&amp;#34; ... this stuff is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love how fast it dries my hair and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect product for my 2 thick haired daughters</li>
            <li>Love my new hair product!  </li>
            <li>Great product, actually does reduce drying time and leaves hair very silky.</li>
            <li>Smells good and it does dry hair somewhat faster.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth, shiny and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Smells great, detangles easily, and definitely cuts back my drying time.</li>
            <li>My unruly hair (a little frizzy/curly/Prone to fits in humidity) stays nice and smooth for 3 days with this product!</li>
            <li>It works amazing on my hair &amp; it also helped my color last longer.</li>
            <li>Great product, blow drying takes only few minutes and makes your hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m finished with everything my hair looks soft, glossy and healthy.</li>
            <li>From drippy wet shower hair to straightened and perfect out the door, in 18 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li>I would recommended this product if your looking for a good product to help dry hair fast.</li>
            <li>Will buy the large size from now on!</li>
            <li>Received a small bottle of this as a Christmas gift and liked it so much bought more.  </li>
            <li>I do use several sprays and coat my hair well in order to get that result, but even that I am not having to reorder more than once every 2 months.</li>
            <li>(Pardon my &amp;#34;snark!&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser used it on me, loved everything but the price so checked in amazon and found it priced about half as much.</li>
            <li>It cuts the blow dry time, makes your hair easy to brush and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy!</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair nice and smooth, not sure if it really cuts drying time too much.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair super soft and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really cut the drying time...</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>I still really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to spray on much either.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair shiny and smooth, it also keeps its style.</li>
            <li>I can go two days without re-styling my hair which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very chemical</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference for me.</li>
            <li>This is now a constant companion, and VERY MUCH worth looking into!</li>
            <li>My hair gets greasy pretty quickly without product and using other shine and smoothing products made my hair even more oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li>It made my hair both soft and shiny, which is pretty amazing because my hair tends to get dry in the winter time due to my highlights.  </li>
            <li>So far I love everything about it, and yes, it does cut down the drying time...</li>
            <li>Makes drying  my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast and easy!</li>
            <li>I use this when I blow dry my hair to get a smooth professionally styled look.  </li>
            <li>My stylist turned me on to this product and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I not worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product has honestly done what it claims and cut my blow dry time in half.  </li>
            <li>Locks feel lightweight with movement; not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>since it is fine and thin, so I am not necessarily using it for its primary purpose.  </li>
            <li>I saw it at my hair dressers and asked her how she got my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly pungent, but the scent reminds of aerosol hairsprays from the 1960s and early 1970s.  </li>
            <li>I use just a few sprays to cover all my hair lightly.</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and soft as well.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle and decided my hair could not live without it.</li>
            <li>but my hair was definitely softer and much more manageable than usual</li>
            <li>so after spraying this on and letting it air dry, it makes it look a little more tamed and softer looking.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointing, as this so&lt;br /&gt;Union needs to be sprayed on in a fine mist in order to be effective.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair, which means it rarely gets &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but in using this product, I find that my hair is greasy the next day</li>
            <li>It really helps with the time it takes to dry hair but also with styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does help my hair dry faster</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair dry so much faster</li>
            <li>It cuts my blow drying time in half on my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Different than similar blow drying products, this does not seem or feel like it is building up on your hair; very lightweight.</li>
            <li>As I was blowdrying it, my hair felt like it had hairspray in it; my usually soft, silky hair felt rather coarse.</li>
            <li>I managed to buy a few small sample bottles from a local salon that is the one I&#x27;ve loved for so long.</li>
            <li>I have such a small window of time to get ready each day and this has really helped me out.</li>
            <li>but I actually finished blowdrying my hair in 4 minutes and 30 seconds -- 15 seconds sooner than the My Amazing Blow Dry Secret</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s not more popular, and not many sellers have it here in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really helps dry long hair faster and leaves hair silky.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and sprayed it on my towel dried hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair that tends to get frizzy in humidity.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut my blow dry time in half, but it was pretty darn close.  </li>

            <li> Great product, blow drying takes only few minutes and makes your hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m finished with everything my hair looks soft, glossy and healthy.</li>
            <li> From drippy wet shower hair to straightened and perfect out the door, in 18 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li> I would recommended this product if your looking for a good product to help dry hair fast.</li>
            <li> Will buy the large size from now on!</li>
            <li> Received a small bottle of this as a Christmas gift and liked it so much bought more.  </li>
            <li> I do use several sprays and coat my hair well in order to get that result, but even that I am not having to reorder more than once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> (Pardon my &amp;#34;snark!&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me, loved everything but the price so checked in amazon and found it priced about half as much.</li>
            <li> It cuts the blow dry time, makes your hair easy to brush and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy!</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair nice and smooth, not sure if it really cuts drying time too much.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair super soft and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really cut the drying time...</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> I still really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to spray on much either.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair shiny and smooth, it also keeps its style.</li>
            <li> I can go two days without re-styling my hair which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very chemical</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> This is now a constant companion, and VERY MUCH worth looking into!</li>
            <li> My hair gets greasy pretty quickly without product and using other shine and smoothing products made my hair even more oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It made my hair both soft and shiny, which is pretty amazing because my hair tends to get dry in the winter time due to my highlights.  </li>
            <li> So far I love everything about it, and yes, it does cut down the drying time...</li>
            <li> Makes drying  my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast and easy!</li>
            <li> I use this when I blow dry my hair to get a smooth professionally styled look.  </li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this product and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product has honestly done what it claims and cut my blow dry time in half.  </li>
            <li> Locks feel lightweight with movement; not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> since it is fine and thin, so I am not necessarily using it for its primary purpose.  </li>
            <li> I saw it at my hair dressers and asked her how she got my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly pungent, but the scent reminds of aerosol hairsprays from the 1960s and early 1970s.  </li>
            <li> I use just a few sprays to cover all my hair lightly.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and soft as well.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and decided my hair could not live without it.</li>
            <li> but my hair was definitely softer and much more manageable than usual</li>
            <li> so after spraying this on and letting it air dry, it makes it look a little more tamed and softer looking.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing, as this so&lt;br /&gt;Union needs to be sprayed on in a fine mist in order to be effective.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, which means it rarely gets &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but in using this product, I find that my hair is greasy the next day</li>
            <li> It really helps with the time it takes to dry hair but also with styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really does help my hair dry faster</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair dry so much faster</li>
            <li> It cuts my blow drying time in half on my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Different than similar blow drying products, this does not seem or feel like it is building up on your hair; very lightweight.</li>
            <li> As I was blowdrying it, my hair felt like it had hairspray in it; my usually soft, silky hair felt rather coarse.</li>
            <li> I managed to buy a few small sample bottles from a local salon that is the one I&#x27;ve loved for so long.</li>
            <li> I have such a small window of time to get ready each day and this has really helped me out.</li>
            <li> but I actually finished blowdrying my hair in 4 minutes and 30 seconds -- 15 seconds sooner than the My Amazing Blow Dry Secret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s not more popular, and not many sellers have it here in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry long hair faster and leaves hair silky.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and sprayed it on my towel dried hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair that tends to get frizzy in humidity.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut my blow dry time in half, but it was pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other leave in sprays I&#x27;ve tried, this one left my hair soft  as soon as I sprayed it on and combed it through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I blow-dried my hair without this product (and used my usual hair serum) and not only did my hair get back to its naturally lustrous and soft self</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be looking for a different blow dry spray because the smell is intolerable.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have to worry about the massive tangled knots I&#x27;d get with my thick hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I have a TON of thick hair and this really makes a difference especially heat styling every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if it cuts down on my blow drying time, but it makes my hair incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take me long to blow-dry</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair that can easily feel weighted down and greasy with the wrong products, therefor I was skeptical about buying this.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair is a delight now that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry when using this product.</li>
            <li> Supposedly helps hair dry quicker too</li>
            <li> I was using Kenra&#x27;s blow dry spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really cuts down on the drying time, but it seems like it!</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every 3rd day, but this makes my hair unnaturally greasy and for this reason I cannot recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely cuts blow drying time in half and helps my hair from getting greasy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the second half of the bottle unless I buy a replacement container.</li>
            <li> It gives me the ability to not have to wash my hair day, I only have to do small touch ups that second day.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;d usually dry without any intention, but I do feel like this would cut the dry time if you consider other finishing products...</li>
            <li> Strangely this product seems to make my hair appear less greasy than if I used no product at all, even on day two.</li>
            <li> and I would say that it has cut my blow dry time down by 1/3 - 1/2.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottled sample of this when I made a recent shampoo purchase.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it cuts down on blow dry time!!</li>
            <li> I even use it on towel dried hair when I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is normally dry and frizzy after blow-drying.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that could take up to 15 minutes to dry without product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair so blow</li>
            <li> (Yeah, not fun) .</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it generally takes at least 15 minutes to get it dried.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing this spray does weigh things down.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and seems like I had in my hand in the next few minutes!!</li>
            <li> It protects the hair but also cuts my drying time in half and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or make it feel heavy like other products can.  </li>
            <li> The product promises to cut blowdrying time by up to half.</li>
            <li> But after using half the bottle of this spray, the sprayer has become defective.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of oil in it that helps protect your hair.  </li>
            <li> yes your hair dries in half the time or less!</li>
            <li> It cuts down my blow drying time in half and leaves me with manageable tresses with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> After my shower, I did as instructed -- shook the bottle and then sprayed it all over my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> , that might even be slightly unwashed!  </li>
            <li> I also received a small bottle of this as a sample from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that is, but</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding it.  </li>
            <li> Like the product but not really thrilled with the way it smells.</li>
            <li> It settles into 2 parts like Italian Dressing so mixing might create an unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel like it cut down on my drying time</li>
            <li> Those who gave it bad reviews probably did not shake the product well enough.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dried with this product in it, the hair took on a really weird, almost iron-like odor.</li>
            <li> It had a very bad smell to it and makes me really hesitant to buy hair products on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> It leaves a coating on your hair that is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Shaves off at least five minutes!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this secret.  </li>
            <li> It smelled horrible, like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I am a mom of five, who is not a beauty product junkie, and this is a product I don&#x27;t feel guilty buying for myself.</li>
            <li> If you see a flammable symbol on the back of the bottle and it is manufactured in Texas, then you are getting the really awful version of it.</li>
            <li> So sad to see this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheesy name fool you.</li>
            <li> would not purchase this product, if not for the fact alone of how nasty it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely disgusting now.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this because my hairdresser uses it on my hair and I really liked how my hair looked..</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It cuts my blow drying time in half on my long, fine hair. I am a mom of five, who is not a beauty product junkie, and this is a product I don&#x27;t feel guilty buying for myself. I have such a small window of time to get ready each day and this has really helped me out. I love it!! Those who gave it bad reviews probably did not shake the product well enough. It settles into 2 parts like Italian Dressing so mixing might create an unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this bc my stylist used it and I LOVED the smell. If used correctly your hair does turn out a lot smoother and &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; looking. This doesn&#x27;t really cut the drying time...because I&#x27;d usually dry without any intention, but I do feel like this would cut the dry time if you consider other finishing products... Honestly, you get what you paid for, and I was more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, which means it rarely gets &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but in using this product, I find that my hair is greasy the next day and I have to wash much more often.  I typically wash my hair every 3rd day, but this makes my hair unnaturally greasy and for this reason I cannot recommend it.  It&#x27;s not just moisturizing the ends, it is greasing my scalp, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Amazing thing for every lady to have! It cuts the blow dry time, makes your hair easy to brush and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy! I love it!</li>
            <li> works great, reduced fizz and dry time! my hair dresser recommended...but way cheaper here then in the salon!</li>
            <li> Received a small bottle of this as a Christmas gift and liked it so much bought more.  It really helps with the time it takes to dry hair but also with styling my hair.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly magic! Makes drying  my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Love this! Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I still use it!</li>
            <li> Product is non-greasy and leaves hair with a smooth texture as it protects from heat damage.  Locks feel lightweight with movement; not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottled sample of this when I made a recent shampoo purchase. I was excited to try it out. After my shower, I did as instructed -- shook the bottle and then sprayed it all over my towel dried hair. The product promises to cut blowdrying time by up to half. I set my timer and it took 4 minutes and 45 seconds for my hair to blow-dry. As I was blowdrying it, my hair felt like it had hairspray in it; my usually soft, silky hair felt rather coarse. Even after it was blow-dried, my hair still felt and looked coarse. It also felt a tad bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I blow-dried my hair without this product (and used my usual hair serum) and not only did my hair get back to its naturally lustrous and soft self but I actually finished blowdrying my hair in 4 minutes and 30 seconds -- 15 seconds sooner than the My Amazing Blow Dry Secret product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product, if not for the fact alone of how nasty it made my hair feel. Yuck.</li>
            <li> Like the product but not really thrilled with the way it smells.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Works really well.  Definitely cuts blow drying time in half and helps my hair from getting greasy so I can go more than a day without having to wash it.</li>
            <li> I use this when I blow dry my hair to get a smooth professionally styled look.  It works great on the days when I need that polished look!</li>
            <li> Im allergic to this product it causes a rash on and around my ears</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on me one time when I got my hair done and I fell in love. I had to get my own! Leaves hair super soft and smelling so good! Wont ever go with out it again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair shiny and I really don&#x27;t have to worry about the massive tangled knots I&#x27;d get with my thick hair anymore. Blow drying my hair is a delight now that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry when using this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair that tends to get frizzy in humidity.  This tames the tresses and lasts for several days (between washing).  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Gives you shine and helps with tangles and the smell is amazing.  Supposedly helps hair dry quicker too</li>
            <li> Ordered this and seems like I had in my hand in the next few minutes!! VERY fast shipping and wonderful service!! The product is absolutely wonderful and has the BEST smell!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dry spray.  I saw it at my hair dressers and asked her how she got my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I also received a small bottle of this as a sample from my hairdresser.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go without it again!  It didn&#x27;t cut my blow dry time in half, but it was pretty darn close.  It made my hair both soft and shiny, which is pretty amazing because my hair tends to get dry in the winter time due to my highlights.  It also nixed my hair static problem through the winter.  And I absolutely love the smell.  I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li> This helps smooth out the frizzys.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m not sure if it really cuts down on the drying time, but it seems like it! It also smells great and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> This truly is an amazing product. I have long straight hair, and a lot of it. Blow drying it takes forever, but I have found the time dramatically cut by using this product.  My hairstylist introduced me to this product and I would say that it has cut my blow dry time down by 1/3 - 1/2. I do use several sprays and coat my hair well in order to get that result, but even that I am not having to reorder more than once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Love my new hair product!  Was using 3 different products.  Threw them all away and only need this one!  Love it and saves money!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me, loved everything but the price so checked in amazon and found it priced about half as much.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take me long to blow-dry my since it is fine and thin, so I am not necessarily using it for its primary purpose.  I use it because this product makes my hair feel healthier and fuller.  I do NOT like the scent, however.  It isn&#x27;t overly pungent, but the scent reminds of aerosol hairsprays from the 1960s and early 1970s.  I would give it 5 stars if it had a nice, clean scent, but as it stands, the scent just reminds of old ladies&#x27; hair, that might even be slightly unwashed!  (Pardon my &amp;#34;snark!&amp;#34;)  All is not lost, though.  I simply use another--pleasant smelling--thermal protection product along with this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I also use the shampoo and conditioner from this line. But after using half the bottle of this spray, the sprayer has become defective. Very disappointing, as this so&lt;br /&gt;Union needs to be sprayed on in a fine mist in order to be effective. I can&#x27;t use the second half of the bottle unless I buy a replacement container.</li>
            <li> Great smell, dries hair very fast, helps when styling too. I would recommended this product if your looking for a good product to help dry hair fast. Great product!</li>
            <li> Well I did love it. They changed the formula. I have ordered countless bottles but the one I just got was manufactured in another location and the ingredients are different. It smells absolutely disgusting now. I doubt I&#x27;ll use this bottle and I&#x27;ll be looking for a different blow dry spray because the smell is intolerable. Yuck. If you see a flammable symbol on the back of the bottle and it is manufactured in Texas, then you are getting the really awful version of it. The one I&#x27;ve used for years has no flammable symbol and it is made in Florida. I managed to buy a few small sample bottles from a local salon that is the one I&#x27;ve loved for so long. So sad to see this change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this stuff. I was using Kenra&#x27;s blow dry spray but it&#x27;s so much more expensive. My hair is very long so I have to use a lot and this kind lasts much longer. Smells great, detangles easily, and definitely cuts back my drying time. Shaves off at least five minutes!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and the scent was wonderful.  She told me what it was and how it worked.  I have very thick, naturally curly hair so blow drying and straightening is a never ending 45 minute (MINIMUM) battle.  Until now.  From drippy wet shower hair to straightened and perfect out the door, in 18 minutes flat.  So happy!</li>
            <li> Always love this product. Different than similar blow drying products, this does not seem or feel like it is building up on your hair; very lightweight. I even use it on towel dried hair when I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this secret.  It adds body to my hair and I love it. There is a little bit of oil in it that helps protect your hair.  You shake it and spray.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!</li>
            <li> GREAT product! smells great, hair is silky and soft!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Has a very nice scent to it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, except that it made my hair smell...and it wasn&#x27;t a particularly pleasant smell. Very disappointing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but it&#x27;s honestly a dud. It smelled horrible, like old lady perfume. Once my hair was dried with this product in it, the hair took on a really weird, almost iron-like odor. It didn&#x27;t do anything at all for my frizz or dryness either. I&#x27;ll just stick to my Tresemme spray.  UPDATE: Since I couldn&#x27;t return this product I decided to try using it again. I have re-rated it. It really does help my hair dry faster and when I&#x27;m finished with everything my hair looks soft, glossy and healthy. However, the next day my hair looks extra oily so I&#x27;m guessing this spray does weigh things down. I still really don&#x27;t like the smell but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is normally dry and frizzy after blow-drying. This stuff makes my hair smooth, shiny and silky after I blow-dry. It definitely speeds up drying time. In fact my hair seems to start drying within seconds of spraying it on. I don&#x27;t need to spray on much either. I use just a few sprays to cover all my hair lightly. It smells really good too. My hair gets greasy pretty quickly without product and using other shine and smoothing products made my hair even more oily and weighed down. Strangely this product seems to make my hair appear less greasy than if I used no product at all, even on day two. I&#x27;m not sure why that is, but I sure like it. It&#x27;s a perfect product for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Detangles my hair and protects it from blow dry damage, not to mention it smells great too. Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works amazing on my hair &amp; it also helped my color last longer.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Not only is my hair shiny and smooth, it also keeps its style. I can go two days without re-styling my hair which is unusual for me. I recommend this product to anyone needing healthier feeling and looking hair with long-lasting style without hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I just finished my first bottle and decided my hair could not live without it. I was having a hard time finding it.  Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This works well- I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent. It&#x27;s very chemical smelling- I prefer to use non-toxic products and I don&#x27;t believe this falls into that category. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Really helps dry long hair faster and leaves hair silky.</li>
            <li> It had a very bad smell to it and makes me really hesitant to buy hair products on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the stylist who cut my hair used it on me at the salon. Honestly, I don&#x27;t notice a difference whether I use it or not when blowing out my hair. It&#x27;s fine, but I not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff EVER!</li>
            <li> Thia product smells great, and detangles hair nicely but I don&#x27;t think it dries my hair any faster. Seller was great!</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair that can easily feel weighted down and greasy with the wrong products, therefor I was skeptical about buying this. I started with the 1oz bottle just to see if I like it, and I LOVE it!!! It smells great, is very light, yet leaves my hair looking smooth, healthy and full! So far I love everything about it, and yes, it does cut down the drying time...a lot! Will buy the large size from now on!</li>
            <li> Great product... love it!</li>
            <li> It leaves a coating on your hair that is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. My stylist used it after a hair cut, and I bought a bottle there, and then found it on amazon. I have super-fine hair. This stuff helps with flyaways, and frizz and helps to protect against heat damage. Not to mention it cuts down on blow dry time!!</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair nice and smooth, not sure if it really cuts drying time too much.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells great, makes your hair shiney and cuts blow drying time.</li>
            <li> This stuff IS AMAZING! My unruly hair (a little frizzy/curly/Prone to fits in humidity) stays nice and smooth for 3 days with this product! Makes my hair smooth, shiny and dries super fast. This is now a constant companion, and VERY MUCH worth looking into!</li>
            <li> I love how fast it dries my hair and how smooth and sleek it looks after I&#x27;m done. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible. Works wonders! I have thick long hair that could take up to 15 minutes to dry without product. (Yeah, not fun) . With this product I can be done in 5 mins! Makes hair shiny and soft as well. I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s not more popular, and not many sellers have it here in Amazon. That needs to change!</li>
            <li> This is probably my all-time favorite hair product. Cuts drying time and leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> This product has honestly done what it claims and cut my blow dry time in half.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good and it does dry hair somewhat faster.  I often leave the house without blow drying my hair and so after spraying this on and letting it air dry, it makes it look a little more tamed and softer looking.  Really nice!</li>
            <li> Great product, price, quality, company, and shipping arrival time!</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this product and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  It protects the hair but also cuts my drying time in half and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or make it feel heavy like other products can.  I have a TON of thick hair and this really makes a difference especially heat styling every day.</li>
            <li> Great product, actually does reduce drying time and leaves hair very silky.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;m not certain if it cuts down on my blow drying time, but it makes my hair incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair super soft and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great and helps make my hair smooth in all weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair dry so much faster but I LOVE the way it makes my hair feel.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle but it&#x27;s not greasy.  It gives me the ability to not have to wash my hair day, I only have to do small touch ups that second day.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works like magic. It&#x27;s a perfect product for my 2 thick haired daughters and I use it daily too! Just an all around must have hair product. Detangles, smooths, conditions and yes your hair dries in half the time or less! Will be using this forever!</li>
            <li> I love the serum from the My Amazing line so I thought I would give this spray a try. I used it for the first time this morning and sprayed it on my towel dried hair before blow drying. Unlike other leave in sprays I&#x27;ve tried, this one left my hair soft  as soon as I sprayed it on and combed it through. I have a lot of hair and it generally takes at least 15 minutes to get it dried. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel like it cut down on my drying time but my hair was definitely softer and much more manageable than usual so I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product, blow drying takes only few minutes and makes your hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheesy name fool you. It has really made a difference for me. You can use it after washing your hair, before heat styling your hair, after styling your hair... it&#x27;s amazing. It cuts down my blow drying time in half and leaves me with manageable tresses with very little effort. And it smells great!</li>
