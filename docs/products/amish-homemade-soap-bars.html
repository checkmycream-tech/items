            <li>it&#x27;s super oily, I wash it, then it gets super dry and flaky!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Bars are generous in size and last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> each bar lasted me about 3-4 weeks, would probably last longer if I kept it in a spot that doesn&#x27;t get wet constantly.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this amish farms soap brand. Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and fresh smell. The bar soap sizes are no joke either. They make great gifts for the loves one and hell buy some for yourself. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at our local fruit stand beside the road for $5.00. I love this soap, the smell, the big bars, and it last 3 times more than store bought soap !! I will never buy store bought soap again !! I looked on the package for a website and couldn&#x27;t find one so I decided to try Amazon, just in case the fruit stand guy runs out !! I really can&#x27;t believe that in some reviews ppl are complaining about the color, lol, that&#x27;s just too funny, they can always go back to the store soap !!</li>
            <li> Buy this soap often. Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> gave as gift and is loved</li>
            <li> I liked it help with breakout from work</li>
            <li> These all natural soaps are a steal at this price! I bought some from Village Life Soap at a festival and I have been pleased with everything they carry. These soaps are high quality and more affordable than the organic products. These are my everyday and guest soaps. I keep the organics for myself. :-)</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling softer, no residue.</li>
            <li> I have nightmarish combination skin - it&#x27;s super oily, I wash it, then it gets super dry and flaky! &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; store-brand soaps almost never work (Dove, Jergens, etc). The price of the Amish Farms soaps is phenomenal - better than store bought, and they are a good size and you get five of them. They are obviously handmade (it&#x27;s important to me to support small businesses), and to also use as close to natural products as possible. This one fit the bill. The smell is pretty good. It almost smells citrus-y, in a way. It lathers nicely as well. It lasts slightly longer than a store-bought bar (I shower daily, occassionally twice if the need calls for it) - each bar lasted me about 3-4 weeks, would probably last longer if I kept it in a spot that doesn&#x27;t get wet constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two gripes I have: I received what is obviously not a variety pack, but one of the same type of bar. I would have preferred it to be an actual variety, but this is fine. The second gripe is though it does moisturize to some degree, I still find my skin drying out. Mind you though, it doesn&#x27;t dry out NEARLY as much if I would have used store bought soap! I still need to use a moisturizer afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Absolutely, it&#x27;s a great product, though I think I&#x27;ll still continue my search for the one soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, IF that&#x27;s even possible (&#x27; I know you&#x27;re out there somewhere~ &#x27;) but regardless I would highly recommend this soap. It&#x27;s a GREAT value!</li>
            <li> PURE!!!  NO ITCHINESS ON MY BODY AFTER SHOWERING!!!</li>
            <li> strong scent and crumbles.</li>
            <li> Good soap.  Great lasting scent.  I recommend the product.  However I recommend you shop elsewhere for it.  A store near my sister&#x27;s house sells this for 2.99!  I&#x27;ll pass on this and load up my next visit to her house!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! No anti-bacterial ingredients my dermatologist told me to stay away from. I like the smell a lot too!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. Bought a 5 bar bag at an auction in W Monroe La and loved it . Made an order recently from Amazon for more.</li>
            <li> Soap is overpriced found some in mobile Alabama for half the price! Same brand, quality, and quantity!</li>
            <li> Great product....smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This is great soap. Saved money. Felt like I was buying American. Will last longer than the mass-produced brands, as it is not filled with lotion or other fillers. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the receiver raved about the superior quality of the soaps.  She highly recommended them to others.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and at a great price</li>
            <li> I do not care for the pink that comes in this pack, as it has a slight rose scent to it...and hopefully when I order again the pink can be eliminated from my pack, but regardless, this is the best soap I have ever used!  Lathers amazingly, other than the pink they all have a clean and fresh scent, and I feel more clean than with any other soap I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be a life long customer FOR SURE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bars are generous in size and last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  Mine came in just a plain plastic bag, with no label or nothing.  I was hoping to see the ingredients used in the making of this soap.  I like it much better than soap from the grocery store.  But,  I think I&#x27;ll order something different next time...something with the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Love this soap .leave your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The shipping came within four days. I like that part, but the soap had two larger pieces and three smaller once that look like it was broken in half and called it one each. I have very dry skin and fine that it does not help to moisturizer my skin. I have only use the orange/yellow one... I will follow up when i have completely used each one of the soaps... I believe its a bit over price for the soaps for what I got and to have to pay a extra $5.48 for shipping on top of the $10 price tag.. We will see how good they work..</li>
            <li> The soaps were very crumbly and in dozens of pieces.  I just threw them all out.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of a kind. Smells incredible and lathers beautifully!</li>
            <li> do not buy this if you are concerned about cruelty to animals.  It contains animal fat.</li>
            <li> i got four bars instead of five and it did not have pink soap instead it had a lot of brown soaps. i would like to see more pink and wight soaps and thin i would be happy please let me no if it is possible</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  I purchase my bags at our local farmer&#x27;s market and was a skeptic so I bought one bar.  My husband has extremely dry skin and the Dr prescribed him lac hydrin and told him to switch to bar soap (Dove) he really didn&#x27;t care for it and felt it was making things worse.  I saw the Amish Soap for a few years but hey I prefer body wash.  Bought the single bar and he questioned the looks of it and even wondered if I bought it on the street. .like a sweetheary he gave it a try and loved it and it has saved on the lac hydrin because his skin is so much smoother and softer.  I decided to try it once I went back and bought a few bags.  I love it and my skin is soft and healthy.  My breakouts(40+ and I get occasional acne) have just about disappeared.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I would love to try the laundry soap but I am such a Gain fanatic I want to find some reviews first.</li>
            <li> We love this soap!  So glad I found it!  Very nice...soft clean refreshing soap!  Looks nice in a glass&lt;br /&gt;Jar on the sink!</li>
            <li> drys my skin out. It does smell good and did clean my body. It has tallow in it which is from animal products if I&#x27;m not mistaken. This is something that people should know.</li>
