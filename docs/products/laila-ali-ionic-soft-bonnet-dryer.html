            <li>The product is great just like described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does a great job of drying my hair without torturing my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>She says it works great.</li>

            <li>Portable and works great</li>
            <li>Great color and portability.</li>
            <li>I paid a great deal of money for a faulty product.</li>
            <li>I have used it for my roller sets and my hair always turns out great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it worked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>So Laila Ali thumbs up to you and your team for designing a great product.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the money...</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>I tie a hair scarf around the outer edge of bonnet to keep air from escaping and that works great for me.</li>
            <li>However while my hair is drying with the bonnet I can do my make up, pick out my clothes,  get dressed,  and even take a nap (lol).</li>
            <li>This is a great bonnets</li>
            <li>Thankfully it works out great for me.</li>

            <li>I had it out of town and it fit wonderfully in my carry on bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But what I have is still good.</li>
            <li>It is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Laila Ali put her name on a good product.</li>

            <li>This bonnet is perfectly adjustable to fit my head.  </li>

            <li>Strong, well built, great buy.</li>
            <li>great easy storing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li>It is just amazing</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have to say,  this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does heat well and the adjustable heat settings are nice.  </li>
            <li>The container does not get warm either....</li>
            <li>While the dryer looks nice it has some problems.</li>
            <li>this dryer has come in handy.</li>
            <li>I like the dryer but when the cap fills with warm air it will not stay in place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it can be so compact when you&#x27;re putting it away.</li>
            <li>Everything stores very conveniently  and the temperature settings are perfect.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>and you get WARM.</li>
            <li>The plastic tubing can get a bit warm on your neck, however, I put a towel between the tubing and my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li>I still honestly have no idea what this thing does.</li>
            <li>Nice length on the air duct and on the cord.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works really nicely</li>
            <li>So, I have been doing my own hair since about December 2012.  </li>
            <li>I used on medium setting and it was sufficiently warm.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that this dryer has drastically reduced my drying time.</li>
            <li>(it wraps up nicely inside the case)</li>
            <li>I have the one that opens like a clamshell and the hose kind of curls around the motor</li>
            <li>This is like being in a salon in the confines of your own home</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice dryer for a while.</li>
            <li>and I really need a quality hair dryer that will give me excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Nice try but no cigar</li>
            <li>I really liked it but does have some issues.</li>
            <li>It comes in a durable plastic case which houses the drying mechanism, and the dryer nozzle, bonnet and plug have their own tidy compartments.  </li>
            <li>maybe some kind of thermal heat resistant</li>
            <li>It dries effectively</li>
            <li>kind of like just inside of the bonnet</li>
            <li>Improvements that would be nice:  </li>
            <li>It is also a nice travel size.</li>
            <li>Nice product, does what it claims..</li>
            <li>and it is nice and warm.</li>
            <li>It is nice &amp; compact and I do expect it to travel with me.</li>
            <li>A nice dryer, works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li>Heats up nicely leaving me with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>I cut and color my own hair).  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, I was extremely excited when it arrived in the mail</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful item - exactly (even better in fact)</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars because it was very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>I must say that the drying power is very good but the first time I used the dryer the hose disconnected</li>
            <li>I always liked these better than blow dryers and was happy when I found they were still available.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, comfortable, however use a towel around your shoulders it tends to get very hot,</li>
            <li>It was a purchase I&#x27;ll use only once a month, but I&#x27;m glad I found one I&#x27;m happy with.  :D</li>
            <li>This dryer is great for me, but it also does a great job of keeping heat out of my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s face when I use it on her.</li>
            <li>Cute, light-weight, convenient, affordable, portable, comfortable and great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The heat was comfortable &amp; pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and compact for good storage.</li>

            <li>Very hot dryer works great.</li>
            <li>Perfect for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>It looked good and worked fine for 6 1/2 months or so.</li>
            <li>The cap is good quality and very strong but the cap does run big-not worry though, it does have a drawstring so that it can be adjusted to fit your head.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and pretty..:-) very good purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to have my curls without any friz, even when the humidity rose during the day.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchasing decisions I made thus far on</li>
            <li>This dries great and fun.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they were more explicit about this in the instructions.</li>
            <li>Great purchase worth the money I paid</li>
            <li>The airflow is good and the heat setting is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Beautifully designed and works very well!  </li>
            <li>The accident gave me the perfect opportunity to try another soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>To be honest it didn&#x27;t feel safe at all ...</li>
            <li>far as drying, I think that the product does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Temperature-wise, it is the best soft bonnet dryer that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>This bonnet hair dryer is the best dryer I have ever purchased by far.</li>
            <li>The cord has never come off on its own either :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to roll and style my hair again.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my Soft Bonnet Dryer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to store and move about!</li>

            <li>Everything fits great in the case and it really dries nicely.</li>
            <li>Stylish (love, love, love the purple color!)</li>
            <li>but its very strong and it gets hot!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister as a gift; she said it works great and gets really hot.</li>
            <li>First time using it was great .......</li>
            <li>It does get hot af after a while lol, but the cooler setting that it has works just as well.</li>
            <li>Everything was great the first two uses.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a great hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>Worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>The bonnet fits really good and true to the temperature setting.</li>
            <li>Even on the hot/high setting, it is still very comfortable (i.e., I&#x27;m not sweating or my head doesn&#x27;t feel like it is overheating.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very comfortable with the level of heat that I get, though.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>Its very light weight and</li>
            <li>I works well, nice and portable and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>Easy to store, nice compact shape.</li>
            <li>dries my hair nicely and stores away so easily.</li>
            <li>for the first time I am winning!!</li>
            <li>Comes in a super cute case and very easily stored!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and has good air flow.</li>
            <li>I certainly appreciate the great quality in this product.</li>
            <li>bonnet is a bit large but works great.</li>
            <li>i really have to tie it very securely or it will just fly off when i turn it on.  </li>
            <li>great product huge adjustable bonnet, worth the price that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>it is a good dryer so far and the price is good.</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer on 4/11 and received it the next day (which is awesome by the way).</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>By the time I got it on most rollers fell off.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to attach it permanently, which means I will no longer be able to store it.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to fold the bonnet neatly and compactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>course, the dryer makes noise, but I am easily able to watch TV or video on mobile device</li>
            <li>I just make sure the bonnet is not covering my ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I bought it, after all. :)</li>
            <li>Have taken this on trips and after a day at the beach or pool, I can still go to dinner with my hair looking fab! :-)  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love the color and everything.</li>
            <li>Once you are able to hold a pose where the tube piece does not come out of the cap, you will get the results you need.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love the portable convenience of it,  </li>
            <li>I will love it forever...</li>
            <li>I wish that the hose locked into the cap with more security</li>
            <li>:-)</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase..</li>
            <li>I love the convince of being able to move about while watching tv or reading a book etc.</li>
            <li>Although I have a steamer for that purpose I would certainly be able to use this as well.</li>
            <li>I wish it would stay on better</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my mom LOVES purple!  </li>
            <li>it works perfectly every time I use it to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re  better off getting the cordless  turban.</li>
            <li>well I like it better that air drying my hair</li>
            <li>Definitely the best hair dryer I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needs more air volume.</li>
            <li>When using, you have to be sure that you have nothing else to do but sit there.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is much more efficient, heat doesn&#x27;t escape into the air, all of the heat is directed to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is compact, but the bonnet is a no-no.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d like to be able to put it on the floor</li>
            <li>I love the way the bonnet look and the compactness of it, After 3 uses some parts of my hair</li>
            <li>I tried it myself and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this thang &amp; would recommend this to any thicked haired girl in the world :)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love the upgraded unit.</li>
            <li>This is great to use just out of the shower, put the cap on and proceed to get your face ready, etc.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred more space for better air flow.</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>I love the compactness and portability of this unit.</li>
            <li>Smooth, silky soft, beautiful curls!  </li>
            <li>Better than that cheap bonnet attachment for the hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t cook your hair or flies off your head!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Very happy with it and the two different settings.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it and as a result</li>
            <li>I love it and no longer use my blow drier.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I will be purchasing my own dryer.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the conair brand.  </li>
            <li>just love this thing.</li>
            <li>Like I said I really love this thing</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I love this ...</li>
            <li>, I love that I can just put it up when I am done..;.</li>
            <li>Who could ask it for more?</li>
            <li>Nope would continue searching for a better one.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>We all love it in my family.</li>
            <li>I love the portability and size of it.  </li>
            <li>I wish that there was a better way to adjust the cap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So, all I can say is I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love the compact size and the performance of this dryer.</li>
            <li>I remember growing up and this was what most people used.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I only wish I did a comparison video because I&#x27;m that impressed!</li>
            <li>this is another product that may stay in the box untouched in your closet most of the time.</li>
            <li>I was able to watch a movie on my laptop (using headphones)</li>
            <li>Medium is definitely more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Put the thing on your bed and make sure you have a towel around your neck</li>
            <li>I am so glad i got this dryer.</li>
            <li>but now its $11 more the</li>
            <li>I have been looking forward for this dryer, for the most part I like it</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic find!</li>
            <li>I primarily use the lowest heat setting as it provides plenty of heat!</li>
            <li>i just wish the heat was a tad bit more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>I love the amount of heated air coming out of the dryer.</li>
            <li>This was okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to watch tv and hear it, you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love you can pack it all in one case.</li>
            <li>I love my dryer.</li>
            <li>in all, it looks like the version pictured on AMAZON is an improved version than from what I have, so it should be better.</li>
            <li>So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this item it works well</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>My daughters use it and they love it as well.  </li>
            <li>Dryer worked great and has a very roomy bonnet.</li>
            <li>I was able to do just that with this dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, I love the color and</li>
            <li>It looks sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very impressed with the performance and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is portable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I have used a hooded dryer for years and this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the fact that I can attach this to an extension cord and can multi task (vaccum, wash/fold laundry).</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I am able to use this dryer while seated on my couch or on a chair.  </li>
            <li>I wish the tubing was a bit longer to allow more flexibility and allow me to shift without it popping out  </li>
            <li>but I absolutely LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the four settings.</li>
            <li>wish the hose were longer&lt;br /&gt;The hose to bonnet connection needs some sort of locking mechanism to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come apart during use.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Does generate some static electricity.</li>
            <li>Get this thing a better bonnet</li>
            <li>Apart from the most fabulous shade of purple, this dryer has the power of an Ali punch!  </li>
            <li>didnt make me like drying any better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the one I used in the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love my Lalia Ali bonnet dryer cause it does the job.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this is so much better</li>
            <li>One of my favorite birthday gifts this year!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love Laila</li>
            <li>and I love purple.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Gold &#x27;N Hot&amp;#34; is a much better product</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Oh gosh, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this bonnet sauna/dryer, I use for many things: deep conditioning oils, add heat to the rollers, after wash creams &amp; lotions.. etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall is ok for the $, saved me some $ in beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li>I also love how the air flow is distributed evenly over my head</li>
            <li>Lastly, I love the size of it.</li>
            <li>SO glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li>I bought it from another catalog company for about $10 more.</li>
            <li>The unit is self-contained and cute.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I received my replacement today as promised and I am completely satisfied that I received the dryer as pictured.  </li>
            <li>The quality is even a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the hose part was longer , and that the hose and cord were retractable, but I guess it would then cost more money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to use when I deep condition, and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy!</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ll have better luck than me.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>So glad I took chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than a Conair bonnet dryer....</li>
            <li>I def needed this hair dryer and love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps this from being perfect is the tube length.</li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer for the most part except for the hood keeps sliding off of my head</li>
            <li>The Bonnet is tighter fitting and the case with the opening lid is no more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the compartments for storage of the cord,hose and bonnet.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even know how many years ago, she wanted one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident that my hair won&#x27;t be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a very big head, so the bonnet size is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be easier or more convenient.</li>
            <li>The quality is great it drys your hair fast but doesn&#x27;t burn you like most dryers.</li>
            <li>I love to use it for styling and for heat treatments.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the job, could have done it better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the reviews were spot on.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to like it</li>
            <li>but I think it is better than the high-heat curling irons/</li>
            <li>It works OK.</li>
            <li>The dryer is so neat and compact and puts out more heat than any dryer I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for deep conditioning, and for drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It would be 5 stars if the hose would stay on better</li>
            <li>We love the color too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to move it around the house with no problem.</li>
            <li>and I was able to save some money.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>SO glad I gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can tell will be able to handle plenty more sessions.</li>
            <li>I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.mend</li>
            <li>I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the style and the purple cover.</li>
            <li>I love the deign of this dryer.</li>
            <li>I find this holds hair styles better than the curling irons.</li>
            <li>This dries my most of my head when in rollers in about 45 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you have curlers in and the bonnet rests on the curlers, that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would love a shoulder strap</li>
            <li>Aside from that...I love the product.</li>
            <li>Love how compact and portable the dryer is.</li>
            <li>It came really fast and it is great quality</li>
            <li>It does the job I bought it to do, mostly.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can take the dryer anywhere in my house.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I do find that this performs much better than the Conair dryer.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I finally got it!</li>
            <li>I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love my hair dryer</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this dryer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that visually I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t mind as much.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love the hood, and the compact size.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have a big head and this dryer works perfectly for drying my locs.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>so I can doze off :)</li>
            <li>so I rigged this up to an inverter to be able to defrost my windows for a winter drive</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What I received doesn&#x27;t have a case top that opens, it is just like the Revlon and Conair models with the hose coming from the side of the case.</li>
            <li>Tried returning it but received so many hassles.</li>
            <li>and I plan on using this 6 or more times a month</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>I also love how you can transport it around.  </li>
            <li>Love Laiala Ali product.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I have to get use to the Bonnet, tying the bonnet on :-)</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It was great, my mother likes it very well.</li>
            <li>Was way better quality</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the dryer has a compartment for the hose, the bonnet and the cord - without being a flip-top design.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time, product is better than stated.</li>
            <li>You will love this dryer.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here on amazon, I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love the settings.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone and they love it.</li>
            <li>I was very upset and bummed, because when it worked it was great.</li>
            <li>The air seems to be concentrated in the top of your head</li>
            <li>And most of all I can take it with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I put this dryer through it&#x27;s paces and found it to be more than efficient.</li>
            <li>you can read more about how that goes at NaturalSistahs dot com</li>
            <li>make sure you keep the plastic cap.</li>
            <li>Would like it better with 8 or 10 inches added to hose.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Since it&#x27;s comfortable and effective,  I DC more often.  </li>
            <li>It is just perfect for my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>I love the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li>Once you turn on the heat the air shuts to the top and blows the hood off.  </li>
            <li>It was more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the versatilty of the bonnet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer</li>
            <li>The cap is very very large and will for sure cover a good size or amount of rollers.</li>
            <li>I was able to deep condition and try my hair very nicely!</li>
            <li>when you could find a decent heating cap or hair dryer for those occasions when you just want to curl up with a good book (now on your ipad) and be nice to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It dries UR hair pretty good and in no time :)</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this is a great dryer,  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight which is great and easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li>Excellent service, easy return because all I had to do was print the label they emailed me and put the product back in the box and give to UPS man.</li>
            <li>Cool is warm.  </li>
            <li>The temperature is pretty good though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it unless it&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hose that attaches from the dryer unit onto the bonnet is a good length and it didn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it is very reliable and convenient!</li>
            <li>I use this dryer for my rollersets and ot heats up pretty good.</li>
            <li>However, the Conair I used to own had a bonnet this size and accommodated a full roller set for me with ease.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It heats up pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good dryer.</li>
            <li>with a towel it should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using the cool setting which was warm.</li>
            <li>Then I saw the heat and cool button that was kind of hiding under the air tube and</li>
            <li>Very good dryer for deep conditioning  Love it</li>
            <li>This dryer is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable and efficient!</li>
            <li>And I really love how easy it is</li>
            <li>, hair dries quickly and fits over head nicely, with or without rollers.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE SLIPS OFF SURFACES MORE EASILY</li>
            <li>This would not be an issue if lid latch were more sturdy or had a reliable, strong hold-open option.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is purple and so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Plus it is cute and compact so it stores easily.</li>
            <li>I love how the equipment is all together and easy to carry from one place to another.</li>
            <li>If you are just wanting to just dry your hair, your best bet is a blow dryer as the bonnet was designed for use with curlers.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is portable, can be easily set up anywhere.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit with the jumbo rollers I purchased, but I was able to wear the bonnet with 18 jumbo curlers on my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that when I roll my hair that the rollers will make up for the extra space and the cap will fit perfectly then.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will enjoy it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>This is great &amp; not damaging on my natural curls!</li>
            <li>the warm setting, the hose gets hot, but it is not uncomfortable and it might be nice in the winter to have the warm hose on my arm.</li>
            <li>Also the amazing thing is,is that the tube that puts heat in the head dryer is insulated so it won&#x27;t burn the tube or even feel hot!</li>
            <li>The bonnet seems to be mostly designed for those who are doing huge roller sets.</li>
            <li>Works great, but it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I can sit where ever I want to sit.</li>
            <li>One more thing, The cord that contact to the bonnet kept falling off although I head a clicking sound when I attach it.  </li>
            <li>Best money spent.</li>
            <li>Have been very pleased with the quality and hot temp.</li>
            <li>The dryer is also light weight &amp; though this should not matter, it is also stylish.</li>
            <li>This dryer is great as far as the motor.</li>
            <li>love the fit.</li>
            <li>I can see myself getting a great deal of use out of it whether my hair is in a weave or natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to my natural hair styling products.</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>I think the hose connector could have a more secure mechanism to stop the hose detaching</li>
            <li>elastic headband, it would have been much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Product performed as expected and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>one is portable and works great for this purpose and also for drying with curlers (kinda old school</li>
            <li>great product so far.</li>
            <li>Ideally I would like the bonnet a bit bigger</li>
            <li>I love this product, it so compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>which I love, I don&#x27;t like them being cheap with the heat.</li>
            <li>I love that it is compact, all the pieces fit in their place and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Love the light weight of this dryer.</li>
            <li>I chose this product, for the convenience first; I liked the idea of being able to unplug the bonnet to take breaks from drying, or if I needed to do something else.  </li>
            <li>I did have issues with the hose constantly becoming un-attached from the bonnet</li>
            <li>Brand new in the box perfect thanks.</li>
            <li>It worked well, got very hot, was compact and very easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Most impressed with its large bonnet (plenty big for many jumbo rollers) and the tie that secures the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>The original one pretty good</li>
            <li>All in all so far I love it!!</li>
            <li>The Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer has come in very handy.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is awesome!</li>
            <li>I took the advice of other reviewers and tied the strap under my chin and it stays on perfectly.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is full size and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the product is lightweight, easy to carry and store and can be tucked away in a suitcase when you have to just go.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easily remedied by wearing a scarf when using this dryer.</li>
            <li>so I can easily move around...</li>
            <li>It easily fits under the cabinet or under the bed.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble not to noisy</li>

            <li>: Easy Setup, some even air flow, compact, the price (under $40).&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>There could be more room for hood storage but it will fit in the space available.  </li>
            <li>but it was done very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can switch the heat settings easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and does the job everytime.  </li>
            <li>This dryer works great on my curly hair, the only problem is, since I&#x27;m not using curlers, it flattens the hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put up and tuck away.  </li>
            <li>Compact, easy to use, efficient, well-priced, and</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this thing, great for my DC&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it would be easy or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and assemble, its  efficient and stores neatly in my closet.</li>
            <li>The cap fits easily over my rollers.</li>
            <li>.. seems like it will break easily.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer because it is compact and easy for my granddaughter to use and store in her dorm room.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to neatly package it away when not in use.</li>
            <li>I can easily put it away with no issues compared to a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>The hose is easy to connect and disconnect from the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  </li>
            <li>The air scape easily</li>
            <li>So easy to use..  </li>

            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The hose comes out the cap easily so it inhibits mobility</li>

            <li>Rinse out and hair is silky soft and smells amazing!</li>

            <li>I opened the box the same day and everything was packaged beautifully.</li>
            <li>Also this thing doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The first being that part where the cap connects to the tube gets really warm</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty handy</li>
            <li>But, looking over the other products available, it seemed to be my best bet with regard to cost and portability.</li>
            <li>The hose gets hot so keep a towel handy to cover your arms or neck.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Best bonnet hair dryer on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most is how quiet it is, the compact design and the cool setting is perfect to keep from putting too much heat on my hair!  </li>
            <li>Wow heat up great and cool down great also good price and stores wonderful in small spaces.</li>
            <li>The bonnet cap is huge and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>This dryer works fine</li>
            <li>Also, the bonnet worked fine for me</li>
            <li>All the attachments (hood, hose, electrical cord) fit inside the case, making it neat and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Mine continues to work fine</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>For now, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The hood and electric cord fit inside easily for storage.</li>
            <li>It dries my mid-length hair in an hour which is fine.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is comfortable and easy to use - but CONS:  </li>
            <li>but this dryer gets so hot that the low or medium settings work just perfectly for me..  </li>
            <li>So far,it seems to be doing just fine.  </li>
            <li>Hose could me a but more insulated so it doesn&#x27;t feel hot to touch, but otherwise than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>The settings are fine, (2- hot/cool, high/low).</li>
            <li>The heat is really hot and the best part is that, the heat flows through the entire areas of head.</li>
            <li>I put a towel under and I was just fine.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it drys your hair quickly and it is portable.</li>
            <li>super cute hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly!  </li>
            <li>Nice large bonnet, stays in place with ties at chin and easily fits my hair in largest rollers.</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean and easy to put away.</li>
            <li>It heats very quick and overall is a great product.</li>
            <li>You will also need to keep a towel around your neck as my neck heats up quickly and the tubing gets very hot...not a good feeling when it rubs up against your neck or shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient easy to store doesn&#x27;t take up much space fits nicely in my closet.</li>
            <li>I also use it to deep condition our hair, I love that it&#x27;s travel friendly and compact!!!  </li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great product, light and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Fine a comfortable spot and relax.  </li>
            <li>This bonnet dryer has been the best thing for my hair as it dries super fast and making my hair soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I bought this a month ago and feel in love the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>Very pleased and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i can still move around with this dryer since its sort of like a huge hat.</li>
            <li>This product works well with the huge flexi rods (purple/gray).  </li>
            <li>Laila Al cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is huge</li>
            <li>The bonnet is huge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used extra long/wide curlformers and flexirods; both fit great.</li>
            <li>And this is a huge asset in my hair care regime.</li>
            <li>and I can roll my hair and still have room in the huge bonnet.</li>
            <li>I have a big head (lol), and with the rollers I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit, but it did.</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of laila dryers until they switched the design.</li>
            <li>And, the part on the hose end that connects it to the bonnet seemed like cheap plastic that might break.</li>
            <li>I really like how the attachments has their own space.</li>
            <li>Great for wrap and go, curlers, deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Overall great product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>As for sound..</li>
            <li>The cons are the hose keeps falling out of the cap, the bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit quite</li>
            <li>So comfortable and efficient.</li>
            <li>After tightening it to it&#x27;s limit, it still didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I use it with a plastic cap for deep conditioning and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bonnet, hose, and power cord all fit in the case for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of them was a gift and the person liked it so much I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>but the person I gave this to as a gift was not as fortunate.</li>
            <li>But it leaves it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for conditioning hair and for curls.  </li>
            <li>What a fantastic job</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I am soooooo happy I finally bought it</li>
            <li>Really simple and works great.</li>
            <li>is great for deep conditioning...</li>
            <li>Great bonnet to use for deep conditioning, and drying twist out styles</li>
            <li>Also the bonnet uses a shoestring type tie which is sturdy and helps keep the bonnet secure.</li>
            <li>I found that it does a great time maintaining optimal heat levels under the bonnet and has no problems with getting entire head heated, even nape area.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It took just a bit of maneuvering to get it over, but it does fit.</li>
            <li>The darn thing worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>I close the lid some, to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li>I also like that I can sit comfortably while wearing it anywhere, even in bed.</li>
            <li>I have huge rollers and it fit under the cap.</li>
            <li>they fit.</li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning with heat.</li>
            <li>But, I use it for pre-pooing and deep conditioning and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still playing around with how to keep it on my head in a comfortable way without it falling off.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great dryer that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li>Fit all my hair with room to spare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and so compact.</li>
            <li>Pros: compact, everything in one place, all items fit into case</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great dryer, except for the connection to the actual dryer from the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>My jumbo rollers fit with no problem.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that the dryer is also grat for deep conditioning and works well even over another steam cap.</li>
            <li>My problem with it is the hose to the hair bonnet, it doesn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>Its portable, light and it dries my hair.</li>
            <li>really does nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>it is quite comfortable</li>
            <li>But the advantages of drying the hair and keep your hands free compensate everything.</li>
            <li>There is also an adjustable drawstring which helps you fit it to your head.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A CHEAPLY MADE DRYER BY A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN HAIR TOOLS.  </li>
            <li>This thing is cheap.  </li>
            <li>The case seems a bit cheap, so I have no idea</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel any air escaping from anywhere it shouldn&#x27;t once the bonnet is secure</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars, but the parts are really cheap</li>
            <li>It should fit a roller set</li>
            <li>Please make it available or let me know where I can purchase it alone.</li>
            <li>This bonnet dryer works great for my weekly deep conditions!</li>
            <li>I had to play around with it for a minute to get comfortable.</li>
            <li>It did fit over my rollers, and stayed on for the hour I used it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>but there is no locking mechanism or anything to firmly secure it in place</li>
            <li>I make it work for me by keeping my movements to a minimum and holding the hose to my body with my available arm.</li>
            <li>It may take a bit longer, but I can be hands free to use my computer or read.</li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, drys my hair fully.</li>
            <li>It works great, but the tube is way too short.  </li>
            <li>the storage is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Ideal for wet sets.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a plus that I can sit comfortably on my sofa.</li>
            <li>This is such a great buy.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet and the temperature settings make it great to use on kids and adults.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and</li>
            <li>Works great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>It does the job but the hose conector is cheap.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is cheap.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable.</li>
            <li>The hose stays securely attached to the bonnet if you turn it to a its locking position.</li>
            <li>air intake away from me to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap and so is the product.  </li>
            <li>All of the accessories fit inside the purple case.</li>
            <li>A great replacement to the big hooded dryer.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The cap fits snug and it snaps onto the tube so that it will feel and look secure.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Me and my sister use this so much that she decided to get her own.  </li>
            <li>I got this on time &amp; it is great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bonnet and very portable.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, but loud</li>
            <li>Works great ,compact thanks so much, Debi</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been looking for a good soft bonnet cap dryer for a while, then i stumbled across this one.</li>
            <li>My wife and I were impressed with how much quieter it is compared to our last one.</li>
            <li>So far, so good-</li>
            <li>I love it so much I brought 2 one for me and one for my neice that love it also</li>
            <li>But for me,after using the hot setting for 45 min, the cool setting is nice.  </li>
            <li>I use high/hot for 10 minutes and then 10 minutes on high-low and within 20 minutes of sitting under my soft bonnet - reading a book, doing a crossword, my hair is soft, bouncy, shiny, and I am so, so happy with it!  </li>
            <li>the cool setting is warm and the hot gets really hot!!</li>
            <li>This dryer is perfect for me because it dries my thick hair quickly (about an hour, which falls into my normal drying range at the salon) without a great deal of heat.  </li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s nice and hot, dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new look, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the version I received.</li>
            <li>Took me about a minute to make sure I had the cap on right</li>
            <li>Easy to read temperatures settings (4 settings from cool to hot).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This works well and gets really hot!!</li>
            <li>When I took the bonnet off, my shower cap was holing on to so much heat!!!</li>
            <li>Shipping to Europe was amaizing fast!!!</li>
            <li>Now if I could figure out a way for a machine to straighten my hair while I&#x27;m sitting here instead of me spending an hour blowing my hair straight - that would be a miracle!!!  </li>
            <li>Overall, very nice resullts.</li>
            <li>Its super comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to store in addition to drying my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I love having both my hands free while drying and if you really want/need to multi-task its easy to twist off/on the heat cord from the bonnet.</li>
            <li>One quick turn of your head and it could easily fall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to Use, Dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it the best bonnet on the market shipped fast too, and the color purple and black rocks with all my accessories</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and is so compact it&#x27;s easy to store away.</li>
            <li>It is also very flimsy in my opinion as it tips over very easily.</li>
            <li>It has worked really well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I took it with me on a weekend getaway, it is very easy and fast to set up, then pack away.  </li>
            <li>New favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li>Over all this is an AMAZING hair dryer I HIGHLY recommend getting this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who does their own hair at home or to travel around.</li>
            <li>This is a great price and the large bonnet is great for me since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, I am happy with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it leaves it silky, smooth and shine</li>
            <li>I *struggled* to get the bonnet to fit over a head full of rods.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money !</li>
            <li>I just put a towel around my neck to keep the hot hose from touching it</li>
            <li>When I received the dryer yesterday, I was excited to try it out today.</li>
            <li>Gets real hot.</li>
            <li>The bonnet on this dryer DID fit over my head full of Jumbo sized roller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really excited to use this for whatever else</li>
            <li>Like the first time I used it, I was sorting hair products on the floor, and was able to move around with ease.</li>
            <li>Am very satisfied with the soft Bonnet Dryer</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that I don&#x27;t feel hot because the heat is concentrated within the bonnet.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it is portable</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I had a full head of 2 inch rollers on and it fit over them quite well.</li>
            <li>Small things I can deal with, but a great dryer, in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it so much!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to come, but It was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I am excited to use the dryer.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>i was excited that their were 3 heat settings.  </li>
            <li>This device is very light, easy to carry around, easy to store, easy to use, easy to clean and something she will definitely make me repurchase.</li>
            <li>Bonnet is made of nice material and so far everything is holding up and working just fine.</li>
            <li>I choose to try this one due to its great reviews on several websites and I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase ^_^</li>
            <li>So I have been new to maintaining my own hair instead of going to the hair salon.</li>
            <li>The one I received does not look like this, and to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the new one.</li>
            <li>This dryer is perfect for me because I natural and have low perosity hair (naturals will understand this).  </li>
            <li>This kind of defeats the purpose of being able to do something else, such as read a book, while the dryer is on.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lightweight, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Especially for natural hair girls perfect to set your curls and avoid heat damage.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it up but then decided to ask for an exchange which was no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>The heat is perfect for me and felt good on a cold winters day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once; so far its working PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hood dryer that was powerful and easy to store.</li>
            <li>I like how you have a warm and a hot, but hot</li>
            <li>Secondly the tube is hot and was sitting against my neck, if you wear a scarf you will be fine, lol.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably on your head and it is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft bonnet for a while, so glad that I found it!</li>
            <li>Other than that it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Hot is Hot, and the Cool is nice and Cool.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and drys really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, drys my hair quickly and safely and it was totally reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now as we speak!</li>
            <li>This dryer gets so HOT that I had to turn down the heat which was SUPER IMPRESSIVE.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight, has a long cord which allows for movement while your doing your treatments, and my favorite thing about it is that it came in a cute purple case that is easy to store.</li>
            <li>- everything cools off quickly and can be replaced without bulging or popping out of their original storage</li>
            <li>I used it mostly on medium heat as the high heat can get really hot, but I&#x27;m glad that I have that option.</li>
            <li>I used it on the cool/low setting and my hair is sooo amazingly silky soft.</li>
            <li>I like being able to be mobile while drying my hair so that makes it pretty worth while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third - this is the most important - this dryer does not create uncomfortable hot spots which burn your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally - the case is well made, stylish and a joy to use ( I LOVE the color)</li>
            <li>It is very portable and gets nice and hot.</li>
            <li>good but hose is short</li>
            <li>It seems to be good quality and solid construction.</li>
            <li>Good for deep conditioning, rollersets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what others have said, put a towel around your neck or feel the burn.  </li>
            <li>Also the hose is a bit short but still good to work with.</li>
            <li>(Cool has no heat.)  </li>
            <li>It was good to finally find a bonnet type for her.  </li>
            <li>there is also a cool setting.</li>
            <li>I love that this is so gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a drier that could heat and cool, not just another heated head wrap.</li>
            <li>so I unplugged it and let it cool off for about 7 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the compact, common sense hose, bonnet and cord storage</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to two strand twist my hair, sit under a dryer and be ready to go in an hour</li>
            <li>Very convenient love it.</li>
            <li>Cool hair dryer with bonnet.</li>
            <li>I really liked the old unit, save for the craptastic bonnet....</li>
            <li>The slightest turn of the head will cause it to drop out UNLESS THE SETTING IS ON COOL</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a bonnet dryer that had a true cool setting.  </li>
            <li>and so I had to shut it off for minutes at a time to let my head cool.  </li>
            <li>It took about 10 minutes for the shower cap to cool off (I was testing to see).</li>
            <li>Overall, for the money it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair as if I was in a Salon and works good for deep conditioning my hair as well!</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good dryer, kind of loud</li>
            <li>but I swear it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I love the convinience and it is really powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember when simple was good and just ...worked.</li>
            <li>It really limits being able to do anything else while drying.</li>
            <li>If you expect good, space efficient design and a quiet motor, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with that because i have thick hair</li>
            <li>On goes the bonnet, I hit the cool setting and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>The settings seem to be true to their description.  </li>
            <li>my teenage girls laughed at me.lol.</li>
            <li>not a bad price either..</li>
            <li>but overall i find it very good and have found my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but I love it so far!!!</li>
            <li>Good quality, strong material, easy to store, I bought 2 conair but the bonnet is very light, the hose is not a good material and it stopped when it gets</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful, compact, comfortable (considering what it is) and exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best one ever the only reason I give it a 4 star is because the tube constantly falls of the cap other then that it leaves your hair beautiful</li>
            <li>Its very convenient, light weight, easy to use and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easily transportable and tucks away without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li>Right off, I noticed the hose does not stay securely in the bonnet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and it has adjustable heat settings so that it always feels just right.</li>
            <li>Actually my daughter saw me using it and said how cool it was, so I will be purchasing another for her!!!</li>
            <li>This dryer is so pretty with the purple case and everything fits inside so it can travel easily.</li>
            <li>This is a strong, hot dryer.</li>
            <li>Yes the hose can come undone from the hood pretty easy if your&#x27;e moving around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair and have to wash and deep condition every week; being able to do this in the comfort of my living room is really great and has been worth the money paid for the dryer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Also, the bonnet is quite large (roomy enough for all my hair) and the drawstring in addition to the elastic band is great.</li>
            <li>Extra large bonnet which is great.</li>
            <li>the controls are very easy to use and the hot hair really gets out.</li>
            <li>and I had to put a towel under the plastic piece but other than that it did great.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li>I got the merchandise quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is nice and big and has a cinch on it to make it fit.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this bonnet, so much better than that big plastic one you see in the salon.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It works great, the only downfall is that it is very noisy when in use.</li>
            <li>The bonnet quickly attches and detaches if needed.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love it 100 times better than my traditional bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>It dries quick, and my hair is silky smooth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly dries my hair in rollers in 20 min or so.</li>
            <li>Convenient and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This drying helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>my husband says I have a peanut-sized head - and the hose could be a bit longer, but it works well and my hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Finally, this item does the job exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning and dries my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>It cools off quickly after use.</li>
            <li>The cool setting is cool, not cold.</li>
            <li>As most of the reviews state, you do have to play with the edges a bit as when on high</li>
            <li>You are able to keep the dryer on High without burning your scalp.</li>
            <li>It may be more resistible when having rollers on, will try it on high it &amp; see.</li>
            <li>I found that my ears start to burn if I have it on high for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was persistent because it wasn&#x27;t that easy to find and there was so many other choices.</li>
            <li>Was not confident it would work like a conventional dryer, but it works just as good and the convenience is priceless.</li>
            <li>the beginning, it was a struggle to find a way to let the bonnet rest comfortably without the hot air</li>
            <li>Or maybe I just have a big head, and won&#x27;t be able to get the bonnet to fit with my huge curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and seem to be comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made well,  light weight, portable, dries my hair fast, and it reminds me of the old days when you did your own hair at home.</li>
            <li>It get Very hot</li>
            <li>1)style hair as desired or just detangle as normal 2) turn or Netflix or your favorite show 3)</li>
            <li>The hi setting is very hot, I could keep it there for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, the hose gets very hot when its running...</li>
            <li>Gets very hot (will not burn or anything like that)</li>
            <li>Comfortable and fast drying time!</li>
            <li>Gets very hot,  burns your ears if you don&#x27;t cover them.  </li>
            <li>When I put it n &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; it gets very hot</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very hot to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that some things just do what they are supposed to do without having to have electronic dials and digital displays.</li>
            <li>The first two were cheap garbage.  </li>
            <li>Heat gets very Hot and begins to burn neck and ears-</li>
            <li>The casing is beautiful and is not cheaply made</li>
            <li>I mainly use this hair dryer when i apply deep conditions to my hair and its great.</li>
            <li>I can fit a full head of bouffant (large) curlers in the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m certain I could easily fit over head full of rollers if I tried.</li>
            <li>Dryer has 2 settings Hot or cool it really get HOT, real hot :-)</li>
            <li>She can finally dry her dreads beautifully under bonnet and can watch a movie at the same time :).  </li>
            <li>Also, the hot setting is that ... HOT!!</li>
            <li>Also, could not find a way to get in touch with the mftr to request a new hose fitting.  </li>
            <li>hot.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I love my new one.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair so quickly and the soft bonnet is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to set up...took me a while to get the hang of getting the hose in and out but everything easily fits right back in for easy storage.</li>
            <li>The fact that it takes less than a minute to set it up and pack it away without any hassle is a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair dry heats up good.  </li>
            <li>The compact dryer is very convenient and easy to store away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use very compact.</li>
            <li>Switching it to cool occasionally is also nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Dryer is very compact easy to store vs. hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>So to me that&#x27;s a good sign because you don&#x27;t have to worry about this dryer not getting hot enough.</li>
            <li>This dryer is very portable and easy to put together.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; dries quickly; very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li>When I do use it, the heat is fine and it fits over my large rollers.  </li>
            <li>probably a lil too hot!</li>
            <li>it was HOT!</li>
            <li>I did not have to use ANY pomade for the first time ever!  </li>
            <li>This is an attractive, lightweight, and efficient old fashioned soft bonnet dryer, which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this dryer in November I was beyond excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Using the dryer at first sucked!</li>
            <li>ALso, the bonnet tube that the air travels in gets REALLY HOT!</li>
            <li>This dryer gets HOT!</li>
            <li>, I never use it, I don&#x27;t know how can anyone resist it &amp; for what use they designed it on that much heat!!</li>
            <li>Having to do this kinda defeats the purpose of sitting under a dryer in the first place!  </li>
            <li>It is hot and does what it is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>designed this dryer really knew what they were doing!!</li>
            <li>and it dries sooo fast!!</li>
            <li>TOO HOT - even on medium!</li>
            <li>Very compact, easy to store and powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is perfect for those who want to quickly dry up their styles or deep condition treatments.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair really quick however, and I&#x27;m happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries your hair fairly quickly once you figure out how to use the hot and cool settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little giant, compact, heats great, took in my Mediterranean cruise and it worked fine, it can be moved easily, I can work comfortably while doing my hair.</li>
            <li>I had a Sasson bonnet dryer and the soft bonnet was very cheap and the nozzle attachment ripped.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet top is large and will work with even large rollers.  </li>
            <li>I love this.....dries my hair in minimum time; I have relaxed shoulder length hair not very thick.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large so you can fit a lot of hair even with rollers.  </li>
            <li>However, I use large rollers in my hair, and the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t easily fit over them.</li>
            <li>fits comfortably over my rather large head.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t get a good tight fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use right away and shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The hose could be just a LITTLE bit longer and it would be great if the lid opened all the way</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I am still figuring out the best way to dry my hair right above the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li>A nice bonus over a regular dryer is that your ears don&#x27;t get hot!</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Cord does get hot when heat is on high.</li>
            <li>Very compact and light weight</li>
            <li>Plus the results were great a and all of my hair was dried.</li>
            <li>An amazing product that I use weekly for my deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works really well, but it is CHEAPLY MADE.  </li>
            <li>except the body is to light fall over way to much....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday but this works great.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>So far tthis product has worked perfectly and the o ring is still firmly attatched to the hood.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>i am really enjoying my tonic soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely keep a towel handy just in case your ears start burning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing my own henna hair color at home to save time and $, so this dryer is key to getting the color to bond to the hair.</li>
            <li>I wish I had spent more money and bought a better product.  </li>
            <li>the machine did not seem to run properly as it went on and then stopped and then started again all on its own.  </li>
            <li>Feels like it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as loud as a blow dryer and was able to sit in my recliner and watch t.v while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is is compact and lightweight -- I take it on business trips -- and it is still powerful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$$$.</li>
            <li>The hose and electric cord both push back into the carry motor which is really nice.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I must say that this hair dryer has truly proven to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>low was plenty warm.  </li>
            <li>Powerful dryer, but the cord does not stay attached to the bonnet.</li>
            <li>I might try finagling the bonnet and wear it in a different direction to see if it&#x27;s more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the motor&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only owned the dryer for a couple of months, but so far, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>: LOUD, could use more air flow in the front of the head.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much because it was a soft bonnet dryer</li>
            <li>I recently discovered using Jumbo sized rollers to straighten my hair (and the rollers leave nice, bouncy curls and the ends).</li>
            <li>It was warm, but I also had a sweatshirt on to protect my back.</li>
            <li>stack your pillows on you bed to prop your back comfortably 4)plug in your dryer and assemble now enjoy!</li>
            <li>i LIKE THE OLD MODEL BETTER.  </li>
            <li>Pros are it has four settings and a powerful fan.  </li>
            <li>the unit has cool or hot.</li>
            <li>I set it on the warm and thats usually enough heat for me.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Helps me move them out faster... will be useful until they can use hair dryers themselves.</li>
            <li>Truly wasn&#x27;t or isn&#x27;t worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the&lt;br /&gt;cost.</li>
            <li>I love the soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s cool setting is almost hotter than on hot.  </li>
            <li>but I love it so far.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for ladies who do rollersets or the like, but I&#x27;m not there in the hair game yet</li>
            <li>Both sessions with the bonnet were a success, and I am sold.</li>
            <li>I used it to deep condition my hair and was happy that it wasn&#x27;t too loud so that I could use my headphones with it</li>
            <li>, temps gets really hot even the cool settings... ?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got 2 settings and the low is still warm enough to use if the HI is too warm for you.</li>
            <li>it is so much more comfy than the old faithful</li>
            <li>and I spend a lot of time straightening it because I think it looks more polished and professional when I do.  </li>
            <li>I was glad that this did not make a ton of noise as the old hair dryer I had scared my one cat.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money I have saved by not having to frequent a salon :).</li>
            <li>love this product and it really made my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I needed a soft bonnet dryer, and  so far so good.</li>
            <li>and after, I am just bouncing, moisturized and healthy looking and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient yet powerful.</li>
            <li>still use it frequently and love to set my curlers with it</li>
            <li>I like that it has three different setting; from cool, warm, and hot.</li>
            <li>I use my dryer to condition my hair, so for me the most comfortable setting is (low).</li>
            <li>I like the hot and cool settings and the bonnet</li>
            <li>It has 2 settings: hot and cool.</li>
            <li>So far I like this hair dryer very easy to carry and everything fits right into to side compartments at first</li>
            <li>It was great at first, and then for some reason the airflow slowed down, and the bonnet wouldn&#x27;t fill up like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>First thing I notice was the packaging is completely new and when I investigated the actual dryer I smiled because it was what I wanted :)  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is really great, if you are not a professional hairdresser but want a hairdryer at home I would strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I have honestly had vacuum cleaners that were quieter than this thing.  </li>
            <li>barely takes up any space, extremely stylish, dries hair very quickly, the front of your hair doesnt get as much heat</li>
            <li>Came quickly, works well, fits a bit funny.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, the bonnet has a drawstring so it stays put even when delivering hot air.</li>
            <li>I like the mobility of this though and the lowest setting is super hot.</li>
            <li>This gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>I usually lay it stacked on top of a sturdy box and that on top of a TV tray so that in front of me, I have another tray situated to either use my tablet and or use this as a perfect time to do my nails since I am seated for at least 30/40 minutes.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my hair was completely dry (when air drying takes 2 full days) in 30 minutes!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome dryer, I get my hair dry within an hour, rather than having to air dry for 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>Because it is so strong, the bonnet, when the dryer is on high, wants to blow right off your head!</li>
            <li>Nothing good to say about this other than they should stop making it.</li>
            <li>It dries well at lower heat settings as the higher are very hot.</li>
            <li>Regular hand held dryer took too long and didn&#x27;t really get them dry.&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly.</li>
            <li>After re-twisting or a wash this is perfect for getting every single loc dry and set in all types of styles.</li>
            <li>Even with all those large rollers in, it is easy for me to get the bonnet over the rollers as it is quite large.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing natural hair for about a year and have found this product very handy to dry my hair quickly when needed.  </li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Can you believe the hose melted and fell right off.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I am not doing something right.</li>
            <li>The temperature is just right</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple of months ago and by looking at it wasn&#x27;t too encouraged to try it right away.  </li>
            <li>It can slide right under you bed, closet, cabinet, or on a shelf.  </li>
            <li>I have to angle it right, but it does</li>
            <li>The price was just right for it</li>
            <li>so it keeps coming right out.</li>
            <li>right?...</li>
            <li>It does disturb the rollers, and is right once all the way on.</li>
            <li>am using it right now after washing and wrapping my hair.</li>
            <li>The temperature is just right for conditioning.  </li>
            <li>, the hose snaps into the bonnet if I twist in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I feel like she has values and would do the right thing and that she did.  </li>
            <li>the hot setting was too hot but the the cool setting was just right.</li>
            <li>This bonnet dryer is so handy especially when doing a hot oil treatment it braid out.</li>
            <li>You get warm or hot air only.</li>
            <li>Amazon were top class because they refunded the full price when they actually didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>Third it is space efficient and easy to clean off hood and case with mild soap and</li>
            <li>Individuals with larger than average heads or those using it for roller sets will find this bonnet a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise</li>
            <li>This has to be the best $$$$ I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Light, easy to use, powerful enough, affordable.</li>
            <li>The elastic around the bonnet is adjustable, so it will fit everyone from a child, to an adult with a head full of rollers.</li>
            <li>wished it will streatch a little more to be more flexiable but over all pretty cool</li>
            <li>It does get hot on high!!!</li>
            <li>The first one was defective - started smoking the first time I use it!  </li>
            <li>The HOT setting was too hot for me even with my ear shields on!  </li>
            <li>this isa great dryer to have the bonnet is huge you can be stress free if you have long thick hair and user large rollers they will fit!</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer, It really does the job.....</li>
            <li>The hood is very large as well.</li>
            <li>I find that it is very large and even though I  adjust it to my head by pulling on the strings it has some difficulty staying on.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is very large and fits over my rollers with no problem.</li>
            <li>The bonnet fit easily into a compartment next to the hose&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Works well to dry hair in twists etc...not ideal for big fros</li>
            <li>The dryer is very convenient to move around, it dries very well, and it is easy to attach and put up.  </li>
            <li>The first one I received didn&#x27;t have the bonnet included in the box, but Amazon sent me out another one pretty quickly</li>
            <li>It does get hot pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t do that with a hard top dryer! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet, I can even watch TV while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair :-)</li>
            <li>The speed can be set to low or high, the temp cool or warm (this button also has an off position so it doubles as the power button).</li>
            <li>The bonnet fits in a kind of mohawk or Portuguese man o&#x27;war (jellyfish) shape (tall at the middle of the top, short at the sides).</li>
            <li>I wore my wet set finished hair Christmas Eve, looked just as good the next day on Christmas Day, and I&#x27;m still wearing today in more relaxed waves.  </li>
            <li>Was not expecting this dryer to be so hot or powerful.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the general operation of the unit...</li>
            <li>It has hi and low velocities and hot and cool air, so I can use it how i feel more confortable.</li>
            <li>The cool is really just lukewarm, which I like cause a lot of heat gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick (and my head&#x27;s kind of big lol)</li>
            <li>The hot and warm setting felt the same HOT.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a pretty good dryer</li>
            <li>It has a nice long hose</li>
            <li>Other than that, pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>I love that I am not limited to sitting at s table trying to find the right height.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality and super comfortable and very convenient to store in my NY apartment.</li>
            <li>because the cool setting is too low and the hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Order yours today and let your hair grow by using this product to do montly deep hair conditioning, great for roller setting Laila Ali&#x27;s Bonnet is  surpreme for all hair types dread,braids, naturally free, and other racs of hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and its just the right size.</li>
            <li>Everyone was right when they said it got hot on their necks.</li>
            <li>First, I must say right off that I haven&#x27;t even opened the box</li>
            <li>It is extremely hot, which is great, but it is too small for flexi rods.</li>
            <li>A compact, easy to carry and use hair dryer for those of us who still roll our hair the old fashion way.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to return it, but the returning process seemed like more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li>but so far so good on the visual side.</li>
            <li>It also seems great for deep conditioning that will be my next test ...</li>
            <li>I can quickly use it while I&#x27;m still getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>So I was going to say it would be good for naturals who wet set and want to speed up the drying process without really using heat....</li>
            <li>Portable and right amount of heat on high or cool settings.  </li>
            <li>It is very loud and made of cheap plastic; I though the hose was going to break off when I was trying to pull it out.  </li>
            <li>other than that I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>I thought for sure this bonnet would only be suitable for deep conditioning</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Gets extremely warm, so no problem with getting your hair dry in a reasonable amount of time!  </li>
            <li>WHY CAN&#x27;T SOMEONE MAKE A DECENT PORTABLE BONNET DRYER?!?!</li>
            <li>Very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li>None of the heat escapes the bonnet for me and it&#x27;s very comfortable to keep on for the 20-30 minute deep condition I do.</li>
            <li>It works very fast and my daughter uses it as well</li>
            <li>It has behaved very very well up to now.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable, too, compared to products I had seen in area beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>I Thank You Very Much.</li>
            <li>The low sitting was very hot and the cool sitting was cool air</li>
            <li>setup is super easy, only within a minute.</li>
            <li>Had it on high cool.  </li>
            <li>There is a high/low buttons that can be used cool high/low or heat high</li>
            <li>Had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; hair dryer, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find and this one does the  job just great.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and the cool setting is great for natural hair so that you can dry a style without necessarily using heat.</li>
            <li>Strong air flow but got very hot even in the low setting.</li>
            <li>I love that it has high, medium, low and cool settings.</li>
            <li>This soft bonnet is very large and fits my large size rollers just fine.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;thing, it should be fine once I use it a few more times and get it tied right.</li>
            <li>Which is a huge bonus for busy college student like myself.</li>
            <li>;) try it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask, especially at this price?</li>
            <li>Dryer gets hot but the tubing where the heat goes through is too hot for the neck area because it falls on the neck and shoulder area.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li>The bonnet/hose connection would not stay connected within the first couple months of owning this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Also the hit setting is exactly that...</li>
            <li>It might take some adjusting to stay on and it is sometimes really hot where the hose is.</li>
            <li>WELL, my first order of disgust was to discover the bonnet does not have a drawstring.  </li>
            <li>After the effort it took to get it on the first time, I just gave up and held the hose and pointed it at my head.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Gets extremely hot on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>where Bc it looks like a suitcase at first</li>
            <li>Malfunctioned on the first use</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today</li>
            <li>The biggest issue for me is that it gets so hot that you need to put a towel or something around your neck.</li>
            <li>Gets extremely hot on medium setting..</li>
            <li>and it get really hot</li>
            <li>I find it better to put the hose part to the side in stead of the back so that the heat wouldn&#x27;t burn your neck.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a HOT BUY (literally) and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets too hot (even on the medium setting)  where the hose enters the bonnet and does not distribute the heat around to the front.</li>
            <li>It did get pretty darn hot around where the hose attaches.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot and fits over just about any style.  </li>
            <li>The elastic gathered in the front was a bit uncomfortable otherwise a perfect item.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as I would like</li>
            <li>I use the medium setting and it&#x27;s pretty hot.</li>
            <li>after that it gets too hot for me.</li>
            <li>First time the dryer didn&#x27;t want to turn off while it was hot and no</li>
            <li>but I just tried to use it for te first time and it started smelling of burnt plastic.</li>
            <li>love the deep purple color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get pretty hot</li>
            <li>This dryer is made very well!</li>
            <li>, I flipped the dryer to the low setting just to make sure I was correct that it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot on your ears.  </li>
            <li>And on the first use the hose broke.</li>
            <li>I set my hair for Christmas Eve today and used this dryer for the first time, with plastic rollers and Elan setting lotion.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>This is my first bonnet dryer, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to outside of beauty shop experiences, but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>But as others have noted when it gets hot, the tube will separate from the bonnet.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>if you like a really hot dryer.  </li>
            <li>I returned this one, because it was too hot for comfort.  </li>
            <li>When my gold and hot broke</li>
            <li>put your favorite deep conditioner in damp hair (I use BioSilk Fruit Cocktail Reconstructing Treatment) and put a disposable shower cap on, followed by the dryer bonnet and let the heat do its work for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The reason I ordered the dryer was because the first one cap came apart and now this one has  stop working.  </li>
            <li>Even with a towel around my neck, it was too hot for me to handle.</li>
            <li>The medium setting was pretty hot on my ears</li>
            <li>but I just moved the bonnet from over my ears when they got to hot.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t fully used for the purposes that I intended to use it for but, using it as a heater for my deep conditioner/color have been fabulous!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns anything.</li>
            <li>my hair with blazing hot air.</li>
            <li>Frizz free, bouncy, soft curls.</li>
            <li>when I first opened the box I saw a big SCRATCH on the top part of the storage case.</li>
            <li>Setup is pretty self explanatory, I cannot imagine what you would need instructions for.</li>
            <li>issue I have with hair bonnet is not a deal breaker, but the bonnet is really more for someone who is drying hair with rollers rather than someone simply deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I even once tied it around my head once and then under my chin to prevent the bonnet from lifting, because it does blow up like a hot air balloon, feeling as if it would like to lift up from off your head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My first dryer came scuffed up</li>
            <li>it would be too hot.</li>
            <li>It has 500 watts of power (most others have 400 but that extra 100 makes a difference in drying time) and does have 4 settings on it.</li>
            <li>It does get hot around your neck because of the air holes in the dryer but that you can put a towel around your neck.</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s back in stock.  </li>
            <li>The first dryer I ordered looked as if it had been a returned item.  </li>
            <li>I use it for deep conditioning, diffusing my wash and gos, and rod sets mostly.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>Gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I would recommend putting a towel around your neck to prevent it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li>It gets &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; hot.  </li>
            <li>Its nice and compact when closed up.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what my wife wanted, but found we couldn&#x27;t use it because the voltage here in Australia is 240 volt &amp;</li>
            <li>I would advise anybody buying electrical appliances from overseas to check out the voltage first, as you are not advised of this when you buy online.</li>
            <li>This dryer was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>this dyer gets HOT.</li>
            <li>After the first use it stopped working.</li>
            <li>As some reviews have stated, this dryer is extremely hot and that&#x27;s just on &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(The dryer looks exactly like the picture listed)  1 year update:  </li>
            <li>This is what broke on my Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>I ignored that, I read the directions and decided to use it in my hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the bonnet and the ability to move around unlike the traditional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>Hot air leaks out the sides and burns your neck and ears.</li>
            <li>The hose gets pretty hot too, but it&#x27;s a dryer so...</li>
            <li>The Laila Ali gives me exactly what I need including comfort.</li>
            <li>Probably could have more elastic or drawstring all the way thru which might correct hence only giving 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The hot setting is not uncomfortable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>hose not insulated so it gets hot on your neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get hot.</li>
            <li>granddaughters love the present.  </li>
            <li>The vent kept blowing HOT air on my neck.</li>
            <li>It was so uncomfortable, I had to sit at a perfect angle and cover my neck for it to even be bearable.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised and shortened the drying time for my waist-length locs from three days to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical to purchase this item at first</li>
            <li>Because this dryer isn&#x27;t really anything to write home about!</li>
            <li>This item does not look like what is advertised on the video review By IsaReviewer on May 7, 2013, on the first page of this item.  </li>
            <li>The hot setting is not too hot though</li>
            <li>The combo on/off switch and temperature control malfunctioned the first time I used it and is now stuck, so the unit cannot be turned off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up having to hold the hose at a funny angle to keep it from popping out of the bonnet hole if I have to sit under the dryer for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>hot and thought about buying it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a while now, and its still working just like when I first received it.</li>
            <li>It also dries hair fast!</li>
            <li>Using the dryer for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that there was a middle setting, and that there was more ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: This is my first cap dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to have an even bigger bonnet to cover my 3 in rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3.The medium setting is fiery hot and burns your skin.</li>
            <li>I used it once to do a hot oil treatment on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like that the dryer gets really hot and the oil treatment penetrates my hair.</li>
            <li>Also... the lid broke off during the first use.  </li>
            <li>Did not know what to expect so many different reviews.</li>
            <li>It does get hot.</li>
            <li>The higher heat setting gets quite hot.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased 1 for myself and then I got another for my sisters.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I don&#x27;t mind sitting under a dryer.  </li>
            <li>The unit refused to turn off after the first use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Hot is HOT.</li>
            <li>bonnet in a pretty purple carrying case.</li>
            <li>my first time using it,</li>
            <li>The hose gets extremely hot with use and burns the skin.</li>
            <li>The one I seen was the first edition and not the one in this picture.</li>
            <li>Most people said that the bonnet was so big they didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem.  </li>
            <li>This bonnet does the job, gets hot</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li>It gets hot but does not overheat.</li>
            <li>The 4 heat settings are awsome and if you want to crank up the heat the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting will do you justice.</li>
            <li>The first one fell of my lettle daughter&#x27;s desk and wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying not to let this one fall because I don&#x27;t know if the first one was defective or if they are that they weren&#x27;t built sturdy.</li>
            <li>However, it gets HOT...</li>
            <li>You may need to place a towel over your shoulder because it tends to get hot (just like the hairdresser).</li>
            <li>The dryer works very well!  </li>
            <li>The connection from the hose to the hood came off after my first use.  </li>
            <li>and it does seem to get particularly hot at the hose part of the hood.  </li>
            <li>First of all everything is in the purple case.  </li>
            <li>The hot setting can get really hot after awhile.</li>
            <li>I like the big bonnet for fitting all my hair but the heat almost blows the cap off so like another reviewer</li>
            <li>No problem with it being too hot around the ears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One funny note, according to the directions you cannot put this dryer on any surface.</li>
            <li>I got this to do a hot oil treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well for drying my dreads after retwisting!</li>
            <li>Used for the first time, tonight</li>
            <li>This is just what I needed to do my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets to hot on the hot cycle.</li>
            <li>The sound of the motor is loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hot is TOO hot.</li>
            <li>This is however, my first use.  </li>
            <li>Which basically means that it&#x27;s blowing hot air out, but not into the hood.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot on the neck</li>
            <li>And my ears dont get hot at all</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast...love the product!</li>
            <li>They are standard and can be used on all or most bonnet dryer machine.</li>
            <li>But if you are willing to hold it it will work well for you.</li>
            <li>The power off button did not work at first</li>
            <li>Wanted to use the item first.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get something more durable and easier to use.</li>
            <li>and I have fallen asleep a couple of times during my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>It gets overly hot now and the plastic part that attaches to the bonnet cracked</li>
            <li>/&gt;4) It get hot - it that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Still this dryer is better than the others in it&#x27;s price range, I&#x27;ve bought several.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked well.  </li>
            <li>Very dissappointing!</li>
            <li>gone are the days of pin curls and curlers but this is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>The hot is BLAZING hot and you will need a towel for your neck.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so hot</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I tried hot rollers and they burned my scalp.</li>
            <li>But it does get REALLY hot.</li>
            <li>I used hot and sat under it for 30mins.</li>
            <li>The tubing also gets really hot</li>
            <li>The negatives is it does tend to get really hot sometimes</li>
            <li>it gets hot but all of the heat escapes because of the oversized bonnet.</li>
            <li>It never got too hot</li>
            <li>It stays hot and is durable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>I order the item after reading many reviews and watching a short video posted By IsaP \\&quot;Isa\\&quot; (Claremont, CA).</li>
            <li>This is my first order that had to be cancelled and still awaiting a refund.</li>
            <li>The high heat setting is super hot</li>
            <li>I never use the high setting because the medium setting is super hot already.</li>
            <li>In 2 places on the box it says there are 2 settings: but there are are actually 4: 1) High - hot (good for the first 20 minutes); 2)low hot (good for the next 10 minutes then 3)cool (a. high or b. low) for the  final finishing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ear protectors when using this dryer as my ears tend to heat up rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>It will also come off your head if it is not tight, so I tie my band around the front to secure it.</li>
            <li>The dryer hair bag is super huge and provides heat throughout my entire head / hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for when you want to deep condition your hair or you want your hair to dry faster.</li>
            <li>It only takes about 15-20 minutes to dry, which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li>Instead of tabs that lock into the bonnet, this unit has notches on the hose that fit into a groove on the bonnet, making for a more stable connection and less chance of breaking those tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good hair dry, and I would purchase the soft bonnet again.</li>
            <li>I saw previous  comments about the bonnet and would like to explain that this type of dryer is for someone who needs to wear curlers to really get a good style.  </li>
            <li>Gets very hot (also a con) and has very high speed, so it dries fast.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have room for it right now.</li>
            <li>I use medium heat which is very hot so never had to switch to high</li>
            <li>The high heat setting gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I think they should make the hose sturdy enough to not come apart so easily because it cannot be replaced or fixed easily.</li>
            <li>She will now be able to go into pool this year because she can now dry her hair in hours compared to days of letting them dry on their own.</li>
            <li>Other than that, truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li>I just wish the hood fit a little better.</li>
            <li>I put it on, turned the heat to medium (high is too hot), and in 40 mins, voila!</li>
            <li>The other downfall is that the hood has a screw like piece that locks into the hose but easily falls out when trying to get comfortable while drying.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my hard hat dryer, glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I really love this one because it is more mobile than a hard hood dryer.  </li>
            <li>VERY hot which is perfect for my long thick hair, very compact and portable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  If you want an inexpensive and apparently reliable hair dryer, this works fine.  </li>
            <li>Paid for itself in one skipped salon visit, plus it&#x27;s a more gentle heat (on low) than the one at the salon.</li>
            <li>But I use jumbo rollers on my whole head so this most likely wont be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li>Granted my hair was soft, but soft helmet hair isn&#x27;t any better than frizzy crunchy</li>
            <li>The blower blows so good that I have to only put it on low.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First - the motor is powerful without generating a lot of extra heat&lt;br /&gt;Second - the hood is ROOMY and COMFORTABLE and accommodates the largest of rollers</li>
            <li>This thing is OK however the cord is very short - so get your snacks and supplies ready beforehand.  </li>
            <li>4 heat and flow settings - high is too hot for me, but medium works well with just the right amount of airflow</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a pretty decent dryer with better heat than the basic Conair bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li>The hose does get hot when on high so make sure you cover your back with something</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the multi heat settings and I tend to use medium and the high is simply too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li>The next lowest setting is very cool.</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews are correct.  </li>
            <li>So if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself just use the high cool setting for deep conditioning and the low cool setting for drying.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that Amazon absolutely fulfilled their &amp;#34;One Day Guaranteed&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li>Dries hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this and use it weekly for hot oil treatments at home.</li>
            <li>I love that it has 4 heat settings and the bonnet would be big enough to fit over curlers if I chose to do so.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my friend that has long dreads and she is in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I admit that I was very concerned when I first looked at the bonnet and thought no way this would work.  </li>
            <li>Does the job but the strap isn&#x27;t very efficient because the hot air comes out and burns your neck and ear</li>
            <li>It gets hot and it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of a hair dryer, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>so much spit does exactly what it says I would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li>Really *Recommend if anyone is considering purchasing this bonnet dryer to contact the seller first via email or phone.</li>
            <li>immediately just let it cool completely for 10-15 min</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of hair (past my shoulders) and this dryer gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Being natural is a full time job</li>
            <li>However, once you have it on and turned on, the air inside kind of holds it up from falling down around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>the adjustable soft hose comes out of the bonnet very easily and is too short.</li>
            <li>For a small machine it puts out very good heat and airflow and it runs reasonably quietly.  </li>
            <li>only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the cord was short other than that it is an excellent bonnet hairdryer</li>
            <li>This little thing packs more of a drying lunch than I thought it would!</li>
            <li>Other than that it dried my head full of curly hair quickly after my first Curlformers attempt and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much from this at first, but found that it really works.  </li>
            <li>I Love it and use it to dry my twist/braid out styles.</li>
            <li>Love it I can dry my hair and watch tv without straining my neck.  </li>
            <li>The hose detaches itself from the bonnet quiet easily.</li>
            <li>This really works, dries my hair fast because it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>and this is nice that it takes up less space than a standing one.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack back up and store.</li>
            <li>Came very quick without express (anyone in Hawaii will definitely understand).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can set up shop to dry my hair where ever I choose.</li>
            <li>It all fits back into its case easily and is convenient to travel with, or carry around.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to put back together.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li>I have to get the dryer part away from my ears and put the TV on super loud - but it works.  </li>
            <li>My hair would dry quicker if the bonnet was able to keep all the heat inside.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not doing yoga while using this one, I find that I can still work on my laptop, read and generally move about with ease as the dryer offers more flexibility.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the bonnet on the pictured dryer and the model I received has the typical bonnet.</li>
            <li>It works easy and wish that the bonnet was smaller.</li>
            <li>Only setback is the hoes can come out a bit too easy</li>
            <li>I had difficulty finding a similar dryer that was easy to use and portable, which is an added plus.</li>
            <li>I wanted to control my curls so they would be smooth and not dry and frizzy, etc...  </li>
            <li>Everything about it is strong and sturdy and built to last.</li>
            <li>On the negative side however,some hot air does escape and bonnet at times needs to be adjusted during use, but overal a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>This is quite handy, small and powerful.  </li>
            <li>so I strongly suggest using it on low heat!  </li>
            <li>This is a very durable, light weight, high quality soft bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li>Its compact, versatile and does the job with my medium to large roller set.</li>
            <li>It heats hotter on certain areas of my head than others.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is large.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large and is adjustable by elastic drawstring.  </li>
            <li>I bought some large velcro rollers and the Laila Ali bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li>I like the settings the dryer has and the large bonnet.  </li>
            <li>If you want high heat, use the hot option with high blower and it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I love that the bonnet tube is long enough so that I can work on my computer or read comfortably while my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li>and I was comparing the 2 in order to decided which one I would purchase and I am satisfied with the Laila Ali version because of price, a little more even-ness of air flow under the bonnet, and that this bonnet stays put as with the Gold n&#x27; Hot constant</li>
            <li>my hair is extremely thick, naturally curly (with a great tendency to &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;) and shoulder lenght.  </li>
            <li>It is an attractive purple and black with Laila Ali&#x27;s name on the case in white.  </li>
            <li>I really like having it compact and easy to store and travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I enjoy being able to sit or lay down with the bonnet.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly, isn&#x27;t too loud and the bonnet is large enough to fit over large hair rollers.</li>
            <li>Anyway, drying capabilities work fine, once you adjust bonnet on head properly.</li>
            <li>She uses it to deep condition her hair and it does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>I was looking on Amazon for other options, but the reviews on the Hot Tools and the Andis dryers aren&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, is surprisingly fast to heat up &amp; made my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>The hottest and highest setting doesn&#x27;t strike me as being especially hot -- some other reviewers have found the hot setting uncomfortably hot, so it might just be my particular unit that doesn&#x27;t heat up to the level that others do.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works for me as I use it more, for it is convenient to be able to put rollers in wet hair and dry it well within an hour.  </li>
            <li>My hair ends up dry not fried ! :-)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and can&#x27;t simply style with a blowdryer and get the volume.  </li>
            <li>Main problem is that the medium setting is too hot.</li>
            <li>but it is a very HIGH quality product.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large and will fit over extra large rollers.</li>
            <li>It cuts down on drying time significantly, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice variety in settings, blows evenly, and stores everything away in little compartments.</li>
            <li>High is to hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, High DOES get really hot.</li>
            <li>I use the medium heat setting because high is too hot for me.</li>
            <li>This provides four possible combinations...low/cool, low/warm, high/cool, high/warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use large clips to secure my curls while drying.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough and comfortable.</li>
            <li>LUV that the cap is large enough to fit over my head and the purple setting rollers with room.</li>
            <li>This is perhaps the only portable bonnet dryer out there that will fit over my larger-than-average (I&#x27;m a 6-footer) head, covered in large curlers.</li>
            <li>The bonet has a large size to fit my big rollers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud--but overall a great styling tool.</li>
            <li>I will normally use high first just to get the dryer warmed up then once I feel that it is getting too hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and cute and works a little better than my mom&#x27;s old old one.  </li>
            <li>Ive only used it a few times but its great - Dries evenly</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>the whole room smelled of burnt iron so i stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>Really works when conditioning.</li>
            <li>This bonnet dryer works really well....</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have have much slack.</li>
            <li>Then when you go to put the hose back in the case, you have to fight with it to fit in.  </li>
            <li>It heats very well and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>And the price is totally reasonable.</li>
            <li>then that I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier already since now</li>
            <li>Two day shipping was fast and on time.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very compact.</li>
            <li>Wish the hair bonnet was bigger so it can fit jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>it dries really well</li>
            <li>The heat evenly flows throughout the bonnet onto my whole head.</li>
            <li>the plus side, those 8 times I used it hair was left shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really wish it would have survived longer.</li>
            <li>It really deserves 10 stars.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair, and it&#x27;s probably very gray underneath.  </li>
            <li>Plus, treated hair isn&#x27;t very shiny anyway.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much since I haven&#x27;t been to the pool in awhile</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer; however, it requires some extra effort to make using it comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your prompt delivery</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Its lid had to be opened for it to work, so it seemed very bulky.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make to much noise.</li>
            <li>When you put the bonnet on there is a drawstring to tighten it, and it stays in place really well.</li>
            <li>Also, door to this compartment is so flimsy and cheaply made that I contemplated keeping the bonnet a separate place but ended up not doing because knowing myself will end up losing the bonnet entirely.</li>
            <li>The dryer wasn&#x27;t blowing as fast.</li>
            <li>Works well and fast, but needs a longer tube.</li>
            <li>I really, really lke this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and can be carried and set up anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I can now set my hair in rollers and sit for 30 to 45 minutes and take out the rollers and am ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a bonnet dryer for months and had only run across cheaply made ones.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for quality.</li>
            <li>This bonnet is very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t seem as if the attachment is going to rip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d still end up really frizzy.</li>
            <li>So....I highly recommend this dryer for curly haired women who want to reduce drying time, frizz, and have bouncy hair!</li>
            <li>And it heats up fast and medium setting</li>
            <li>The heat distributes very evenly.  </li>
            <li>I really like the item and have made adjustments for keeping the bonnet on.</li>
            <li>I really like have a bonnet versus those inexpensive hood dryers (ie the ones sold at Wally World)</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li>So much easier and cheaper to sit at home rather than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really test any out, but I decided to buy this one for about $55.</li>
            <li>Thanks Laila</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>Very impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I like that the unit is very self</li>
            <li>Heats up very well and drys my semi-long  hair.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and very compact.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>It heats very well and is durable.  </li>
            <li>Wd be better if it cd operate w/ lid closed.</li>
            <li>My hair dryer in 30 minutes which is fast because it use to take me about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable, efficient, and low-priced...</li>
            <li>I really wanted a dryer</li>
            <li>(Thanks to Wen).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what all the rave is about with this product.</li>
            <li>Sounds like it will disintegrate before much time go by.  </li>
            <li>I can once again move my head like a real person while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer works very well.  </li>
            <li>It does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>I really want this product, but I want the one that is being advertised everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Very storable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like cold is warm and hot is actually hot.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Also, the unit itself is much cheaper in quality.  </li>
            <li>Really peeved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight out the box</li>
            <li>miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very well constructed.  </li>
            <li>and somehow it seems to make my hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Laila Ali.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the need for High-Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li>and if I really didn&#x27;t like it I could sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer</li>
            <li>I really like my drier</li>
            <li>and I really like this.</li>
            <li>I really like the design of it</li>
            <li>but once you get the fit just don&#x27;t undo it for the next use.</li>
            <li>Once you get it to stay in, you have to sit very still and don&#x27;t move otherwise</li>
            <li>BUT it really dries my hair very well...</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t feel like it was circulating air as much as I thought it should)</li>
            <li>It is a very convenient dryer.</li>
            <li>And it worked really well</li>
            <li>It is compact and very efficient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is very compact.</li>
            <li>it is much easier to store.  </li>
            <li>That said, I only gave it three stars primarily because of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too put out about that and appreciated the forewarning.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t really used it yet.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fits really well...without hurting.</li>
            <li>but the ratings and review seem very favorable.</li>
            <li>very portable and heats up very well.</li>
            <li>The drawback I encountered was that I feel the need to rotate the cap/hose position as the side without the hose didn&#x27;t seem to get quite as much air.  </li>
            <li>But it does get very out around the ear area.</li>
            <li>Shipped received fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dyer</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to hold the airhose to allow air flow through the whole cap.</li>
            <li>Very convenient bc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just hot..easy to use, not like a solid hood dryer where u have to sit under it and figure out how u can do that and still be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>However The hose doesn&#x27;t fit back in like it used to, and sometimes it will not click to off</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li>the weekend, I went to Sally&#x27;s and purchased their Modern Elements 1875W Ionic Pro Rollabout Tourmaline Dryer.  </li>
            <li>so you can fit the big rollers under it.</li>
            <li>this thing REALLY works.</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact and drys hair FAST.</li>
            <li>I would have given this five stars; however where the hose attaches to the bonnet, if you move too much it will disconnect.  </li>
            <li>and it drys your hair fast.</li>
            <li>really works well and folds yp like a dream</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it&#x27;s very compact, so once I was done with it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
            <li>It fits around my whole head, with ajustable strings.</li>
            <li>I like this product because its very convenient and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>We got our friends to invest in this product and we all save so much money buying using this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be adjusted to fit tighter for deep conditioning and looser for roller sets.  </li>
            <li>OK but took longer to dry than my older bonnet dryer from the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I may be comparing it to the old Conair portable I bought way back 15 or more years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this dryer for the most part since I got it for deep conditioning my natural hair.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is nice and big - goes over big curlers.  </li>
            <li>I am a consistent Amazon Prime customer and shop almost weekly on here and this by far is my first 1 star review.  </li>
            <li>I saw some comments about fit problems, but if you turn it so that the air is coming at the base of your neck it works best.  </li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been nice but the bonnet just want big enough.</li>
            <li>It is more compact but the motor runs as loud as a regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to pack, relatively small, I place it right in the corner of my bed and side table.</li>
            <li>but it can get really hot on the high settings and as one other review suggested, use the medium settings and you will be ok.</li>
            <li>oh such a pretty purple!!</li>
            <li>The fan does not push much warm air to dry the top and sides of hair, so you end up with dry hair in the back and wet hair on the top and sides.  </li>
            <li>The motor is super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>The first one did not appear to be new.  </li>
            <li>The item is completely new, no marks, no discoloration or scratches compared to the first dryer I received.  </li>
            <li>tend to get too hot) new model 1 star.</li>
            <li>The heat was fine, the low setting gets the job done, we&#x27;ve tried the high setting too, and that works too.</li>
            <li>Hot is really hot, and cool is about right, but that leaves us with no cool.  </li>
            <li>But overall I am satisfied with my purchase and if I&#x27;m in a hurry and need my hair to dry quickly, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The nozzle attaches to the bonnet very easily and securely, and the bonnet itself is very thick but flexible.  </li>
            <li>It has a high and low fan setting and a hot and cool settings.  </li>
            <li>but when I first switched it on it was VERY LOUD...</li>
            <li>Its either low or high, hot or cool.</li>
            <li>however you control with two switches - High and Low, Hot and Cool.  </li>
            <li>There are 4 settings, low, high, cool and hot.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer comes with hot or cool and high or low option.</li>
            <li>It will dry your hair completely and fast and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>But i love that i can get my hair dry while on the couch watching TV, albeit very loud TV.  </li>
            <li>:) The hose connects to the bonnet a little higher up</li>
            <li>When feeling her hair under the hooded dryer while deep conditioning,  only the top of her head would be hot.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;warm\\&quot; settings were exactly the same -- incredibly hot!  </li>
            <li>Overall this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I have a better cap from my other bonnet dryer which I&#x27;m going to save.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>The bonnet that I recieved was black, which I loved and it is large enough to accommodate rollersets, Flexi Rod sets and whatever your heart desires.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item with high hopes that it would be a great replacement for my broken dryer.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old hard hat hair dryer this one is compact and can easily travel by fitting in an overnight bag or suitcase.</li>
            <li>There is Hot Low, Hot High as well as Cool Low and Cool High, which are more or less like the fan setting on an AC—it just blows air.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up and take down!</li>
            <li>I must say my long locks dried great.</li>
            <li>When I unpacked it from the box and took it out of the plastic bag, it had fingerprints all over it and the plastic was casing was swirly and scratched, like someone had tried to clean it and sent it back.</li>
            <li>Also the elastic in the bonnet is already adjusted tight enough (right out of the box) so that it has a snug comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>really heats up on high ..</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and using this soft bonnet dryer has been much more gentle on my hair than using my hand-held hair dryer with a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hot,  the bonnet is large for big rollers.  </li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot but dried my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>After an hour on heat/low air, my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry back it did warm it up quite a bit...</li>
            <li>But it worked very well and my hair felt super moisturized after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse and dense natural hair, so I was impressed!</li>
            <li>of the reviews mentioned the bonnet being very large - large enough to accommodate large curlers.</li>
            <li>I took the advice of another reviewer and tied a long scarf around the parameter of the bonnet; this kept the heat contained and made it fit (</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return it now and it does not seem like there is an option to have the cap replaced or to even contact the seller directly to see if they would be willing to help in anyway.</li>
            <li>and/or the hose being way too hot near whatever part of my body</li>
            <li>There are 4 settings, cool, low, medium, and hi.</li>
            <li>the cool feature fixes that also the flexibility to turn the bonnet from back to front and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how hot it can get.</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s pretty loud.  </li>
            <li>, it s perfect.it get hot all over and its not to loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact and fits nicely in my smallest, carry-on suitcase.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet ties at the back of your neck and has 3-4 holes at the front and sides of the bonnet that I suspect are supposed to keep it cool on your head.</li>
            <li>I promise if it wasn&#x27;t a pain in the A$$ to send back, I&#x27;d ask for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer I have used it on my 8 yrs old hair for her deep conditioning treatment for her natural hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get small tasks done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer, but I have a hard time make it right enough without it blowing off my head.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it while laying down relaxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has 4 settings: cool, low, medium, and high.  </li>
            <li>My dryer has cool,  low, medium and high.</li>
            <li>They have low &amp; high as well as cool.</li>
            <li>If you use the cool option, using high gives a stronger air flow and the low option would be a lower air flow.  </li>
            <li>This dryer comes with 4 settings though, Cool, Low, Medium and High.  </li>
            <li>The dryer also has 4 settings: cool, low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>Hair dried fast and felt full of extra body.worth the buy:)</li>
            <li>It works fine over loose unclipped/unrolled hair as well.</li>
            <li>The only complaint that I have is that sometimes the hood can fly up if you don&#x27;t make sure to wrap the strings around the front of the hood too to tie it down.  </li>
            <li>And maybe it did for about 15 minutes or so, but I live at the beach and the whole effect</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if this was a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>My conditioning treatments have gone to whole new level.  </li>
            <li>I also love the purple and black color of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Mine was purple and black, my favorite colors, and the case was rounded with the built in handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hose is a decent length, maybe 24 inches?</li>
            <li>and I just love the big white cap.</li>
            <li>Luckily i have a big head and lots of hair.</li>
            <li>but I do not notice that it dries my hair any quicker than older types, without the ion tech, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>Definitely gets hot enough (on the highest setting, I put a towel on my neck just in case), and dries my hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a problem keeping the bonnet on and it drys my hair within a decent time.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like the sleek contemporary design of it.  </li>
            <li>Even on the low setting the heat is HOT but not too hot.</li>
            <li>I felt like the heat was hot enough and not too hot, though I did place a towel around my neck for comfort.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to use that much heat for more than a few minutes)</li>
            <li>However.. the low heat is pretty hot too</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact, quick, and for short hair, it gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>This is the older model where the air pump keeps falling out of the bonnet.</li>
            <li>The uses the dryer at least twice per month and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go past the medium setting (I&#x27;m sure those with longer hair use the higher setting)  </li>
            <li>Has anyone tried this particular model?</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it does feel like its going to fly off your head at times</li>
            <li>The older model was quite and efficient.</li>
            <li>Really cannot move very far from unit.</li>
            <li>The Hose also is very hot and if draped across the body will leave red</li>
            <li>Have to switch between hot and cool settings to stay comfortable so not good for someone with impaired sensations, could burn them.</li>
            <li>Usually have to turn it to low where it is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because it gets very hot even on the lower setting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and small enough that I will be able to take it when I have to travel for work.</li>
            <li>I am fairly tall at 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;, but the hose is long enough that I can set the case next to me on the chair and it reaches the bonnet easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use and the bonnet is large enough to go over big rollers and you can adjust the bonnet over your ears so they don&#x27;t burn!  </li>
            <li>The bonnet fits over extra large rollers and the entire dryer is so compact and easy to store!&lt;br /&gt;Whoever</li>
            <li>Also where they bonnet connects to the hose this fit is so loose the hose fall off the bonnet all the time.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell how long it will last as I will only be using it every six to eight weeks, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and very happy that I&#x27;ve gained back a couple of hours where I can go out in public!</li>
            <li>I really liked it, but it took to long to dry my hair</li>
            <li>The high is definitely high.</li>
            <li>I put the bonnet on for 15 min, on high.</li>
            <li>You will need to protect your ears and neck from the high heat.  </li>
            <li>well I put this thing on high and lord have mercy</li>
            <li>The high setting can be used for about 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I wrapped my hair, tied the dryer on, turned it to high</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and recommends it highly for anyone who sets their hair on rollers.</li>
            <li>She recommends this dryer highly.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t tried it on high heat because if it does it on medium, it probably does it sooner on high).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the best thing I can say about my purchase is that the hood fit over my largest size Goody rollers (the big pink ones).  </li>
            <li>It is made of high grade plastics.</li>
            <li>It was a child sized desk, so it wasn&#x27;t high but still the dryer wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>No idea how this can be so highly rated.  </li>
            <li>I run my temp on high and place cotton around my ears and neck.</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact in size and high on heat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High heat setting not recommended.</li>
            <li>other than I would have liked a 3rd choice in heat setting (medium)....</li>
            <li>This bonnet dryer has several heat settings and dried my hair more quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>My drying results are better too because my entire head is covered and sometimes the back can take longer to dry with a hooded dryer if I&#x27;m not sitting just right under it!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how large the bonnet is.</li>
            <li>It has a large bonnet that covers all of my nearly waist-length hair.</li>
            <li>Love the little case</li>
            <li>so I can move around a little, but I did expect better quality.  </li>
            <li>Cute little carrier case</li>
            <li>I love this little dryer.  </li>
            <li>Its a cute and functional little dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this little dryer.</li>
            <li>However, for setting your hair which requires a little more heat, well this dryer will give you what you want.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this purchase because I am active and wash my hair frequently and wanted to be able to style my hair....</li>
            <li>The bonnet is rather large, and as a result the heat escapes from the back of it and causes your neck to get really hot.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough for my jumbo rollers and heat really hot.</li>
            <li>It is also lightweight and easy to carry due to the built in handle.  </li>
            <li>However, Low-Hot decreases the air flow significantly making it take a lot longer to dry than drying on the medium setting of the Laila Ali dryer.  </li>
            <li>Due to the fact that the circualting air in the dryer is strong.</li>
            <li>blowing off  due to the strong air flow by tying the strings under my chin like a bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Love this dryer - dries my thick hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>A small towel wrapped around back of neck for the high setting is a good idea.  </li>
            <li>If you use low heat then switch to cool, it&#x27;ll cool down a little but wont be a true cool feel.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and as comfortable as can be expected from a soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>Pros: dries hair fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, is purple.</li>
            <li>I am natural &amp; use this to do twist outs when I don&#x27;t have much time...</li>
            <li>Have to fit the hood on the head carefully to avoid burning the neck.</li>
            <li>I bought this bonnet dryer after my Gold N Hot became damaged and generally un-useable.</li>
            <li>I can sit still and watch TV with the sound way up for that long a time - no trouble.  </li>
            <li>The various parts fit easily back into their slots and the whole dryer is compact.</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s old dryer bonnet was really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and the hot and cold buttons work well.</li>
            <li>They are bulky and loud and you feel confined to one spot the whole time you are under them.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job, drying my long thick hair in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the buttons on the  bottom back get really hot so make sure to place a towel under the bonnet in the back bottom.....</li>
            <li>Overall: we&#x27;ll worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>, I get so hot after several minutes, I switch to cool for a minute or 2 then return to low heat till I finish my treatment time.</li>
            <li>My dryer has the following settings Off, Cool, Low, Medium and Hot.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer - dried my hair fast - the bonnet was big enough for my jumbo rollers - and storage is fantastic, fits on my shelf.</li>
            <li>But I learned to turn the bottom to the top of my head spreading out the heat and that dried it faster.</li>
            <li>It gets hot and drys my hair (which is short) really fast.</li>
            <li>I have used Gold N Hot dryers that have lasted for at least 5 years for more.  </li>
            <li>My normal hair dryer was not drying my dreads fully.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that makes this product worth it is the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The results look like I just left the salon (and by the way, I rarely go to the salon...</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair with a mind of its own.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is good but not great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair softer, not hard.</li>
            <li>I generally use it on low or cool simply because the medium is very hot to me</li>
            <li>Everything fits compactly in the case for storage, and it is easy to place back in the case - it is not one of those that never quite go back  the way it was.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and it allows my hair to dry with a natural look, free of frizz.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly to dry braid and twists for braid outs and twists outs, deep conditioning, and when coloring my hair so that color takes in better.</li>
            <li>I will try and sit on the couch and the outlet is right next to the couch</li>
            <li>The cord was too short and had to sit right at the outlet and not move.</li>
            <li>I just received item today, inspected the box and item inside and placed it right back in the box because it isn&#x27;t what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not too big but just the right size.</li>
            <li>I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li>The button too turn it too off doesn&#x27;t always position in the right spot when turning, as I had to unplug it several times to turn off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now actually.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is also large enough to accommodate large setting rollers for you ladies who have longer hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the hose isn&#x27;t very long; however, because the case stays relatively cool</li>
            <li>I had a head full of flexirods I needed dry in an hour before heading out for evening libations.</li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t fit tight and it&#x27;s very noisy plus the heat from the hose melted the cap</li>
            <li>All other bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried either doesn&#x27;t really fit my head when I am doing a roller set</li>
            <li>The heat can become a little warm on back of neck but</li>
            <li>The back of the neck may get a little warm too.</li>
            <li>(knocks on wood) but after researching and researching this, only use i read is that if you put it on HOT and High have a towel wrapped around your neck.</li>
            <li>The dryer also has cool/ hot settings as well as low&amp; high.  </li>
            <li>My only reason for not giving it a #5 is because when I put it on high, it gets too hot, and I can&#x27;t handle it.  </li>
            <li>first, I wished this dryer had a medium air flow setting instead of just high and low.</li>
            <li>However, the high heat is too hot, the motor is louder, and the slimmer case needs to stay in the same position while I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li>If these were new, the plant that makes them needs to be cleaner and wear gloves.</li>
            <li>You will have to purchase a new unit :*</li>
            <li>, I had to order a new bonnet.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try out my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new hair go to.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is big enough to fit big curlers, it gets to a pretty high heat setting.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have noted, the Hot High gets really hot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this bonnet dryer in March and it came with a black tie-on bonnet that would slip off easily unless you tied it super-tight.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet could be tightened and fit well for both my larger head and lots of hair, and my mother&#x27;s smaller head and shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is really big to fit different size head or styles &amp;#34;hair rollers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Low is warm enough to dry my hair</li>
            <li>The only way I figured out how to use it comfortably is to sit on the floor next to the bed with the box on the bed.</li>
            <li>Only problem I have is that the top purple cover will keep closing over the dryer, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried a few bonnets before and only ONE I actually liked...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Depending on you hair length and thickness,  you will dry quick.  </li>
            <li>If you are serious about doing your own hair at home or if you do hair on the side</li>
            <li>Bonnet is big enough to fit any style.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry super evenly...</li>
            <li>On Monday, June 3, 2013 received a call/email at night from a representative stating the item is on back order and was available sometime the beginning of next week.</li>
            <li>Now I love the results and this little dryer is a powerhouse!  </li>
            <li>I love this little device!</li>
            <li>friend told me that most of this was probably just due to a wrong connection made at the factory and everyone else here seems very pleased with their purchase of this dryer</li>
            <li>There is a DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE between high and low hot settings unlike other dryers that have 2 hot settings but are equally hot.</li>
            <li>BUT, it is VERY, VERY loud.</li>
            <li>It is very loud.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very loud.  </li>
            <li>While the heat output was high, the motor was not as loud as I</li>
            <li>Works well but very loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, but it dries my hair well</li>
            <li>This company has raised the price far too high.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a hair dryer that is portable as well as hot enough to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The bonnet keeps the heat inside the bonnet, is large enough for jumbo rollers and gets much hotter than my old Gold-n-Hot dryer.  </li>
            <li>put it on hot, my hair started to dry really fast.  </li>
            <li>it really does dry fast!</li>
            <li>The Cool, Low, Med, High setting are actually for the amount of heat that you want, not the pressure that you want the air to flow.</li>
            <li>and the second is the black drawstring cap is HUGE, i use the dryer for conditioning treatments so the drawstring barley closes up enough for me to feel like its securely on my head.</li>
            <li>The dryer is VERY loud and even the low temperature is too hot.</li>
            <li>If you have a small head beware, this bonnet is HUGE!</li>
            <li>Sent back strap broke first time</li>
            <li>and it actually gets hot...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets really hot back there too</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get hot, but all you got to do is adjust the control switches, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>This cap seems to be made of a heavier grade plastic than other standard brands&#x27; bonnets I have owned, so perhaps it will have greater longevity.  </li>
            <li>The set up was pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I actually first saw this product here on Amazon, but I ended up buying it at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken this dryer on a long car trip, and it was definitely worth bringing it along.</li>
            <li>used someone else&#x27;s Gold n&#x27; Hot hair dryer bonnet machine-thingy that looks very similar to this</li>
            <li>For those people who said it did not get hot enough...please take a second to play with the the settings because as I am trying it is cooking my head lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Some didn&#x27;t get hot enough, some weren&#x27;t heating evenly.</li>
            <li>The first I used it for deep conditioning</li>
            <li>is hot enough</li>
            <li>Stuck in low after the first usage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m unaware (it&#x27;s no longer blowing hot air into the cap and my hair is not drying).  </li>
            <li>Each setting was noticeably different than the others, not just &#x27;named&#x27; hot or medium.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Con is that it is SO loud!</li>
            <li>The outside of the box unit doesn&#x27;t get hot in the 20 or 30 minutes I&#x27;ve used it, so I&#x27;m not too worried about fire danger.</li>
            <li>However, I can use it on Hot temperature and Low air flow and get medium results.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer woke everyone up at 11:30 at night because it was so loud!</li>
            <li>heat doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a regular hood dryer!!</li>
            <li>It gets a bit too hot for me, and there is no middle ground.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for hot oil</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a hot cap dryer, this one definitely does the job.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that this hairdryer has been upgraded and perfected since some of the video reviews done earlier.</li>
            <li>In addition, the hot air shoots out around the sides and burns your ears and all around the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>And sadly, no air seemed to get to the left side of my head at all under the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one was a Conair similar to this model but was discontinued when ionic heating grew in popularity.  </li>
            <li>My last one was the Gold N&#x27; Hot.</li>
            <li>I will try it with rollers next when I try my first rollerset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What i think could be better is that the heat is not equal in the entire head, so you have to turn the bonnet in order to the heat reach the back or</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li>I should have researched first prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do and distributes heat evenly during my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money!  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot just like a regular sized dryer</li>
            <li>I put this baby on and WOW!  </li>
            <li>LOUD!</li>
            <li>I use extra large rollers, put the soft bonnet on and click on the button (you have a choice of 4 settings: high - hot/ high - cool/ low - hot/ low - cool)</li>
            <li>But if all you want is dry hair and you&#x27;re willing to sit still for 30 minutes or so, then -- why not!  </li>
            <li>was a little longer, and didn&#x27;t slide out of the bonnet so easily.</li>
            <li>My head is considerably small and the cap fits just fine  (thanks to the adjustable string).</li>
            <li>so I use the dryer to partially dry my braid or twist outs before bed to make sure my hair is completely dry when I wake up, and I can avoid frizz.</li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t fit over them so I&#x27;ve had to move down to medium size</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, gets hot and my very thick shoulder length hair dries quickly, probably 20-30 minutes on high.</li>
            <li>I do like the new design, as opposed to the old briefcase model.</li>
            <li>but the new one is too LOUD and don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>This new one is so loud.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the color and case and small enough to pack away nice and neatly, and the settings definitely are high enough to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is very noisy, cheaply made, no power ..and the cap is small..</li>
            <li>The hose fit into the bonnet well, just seated it in the cutouts and turned it about a half turn until I heard it click.  </li>
            <li>I was hunting for an economical bonnet dryer that I could use with conditioners to help improve my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have really LONG CURLY HAIR and it worked BETTER than I expected...</li>
            <li>I only use it either on cool or low.  </li>
            <li>biggest downside to this product, which is why I think this is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and not worth more than 3 stars is that the low setting doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I know this hot air shooting out thing is a design defect because I had a soft bonnet hair dryer back in the day</li>
            <li>I know this hot air shooting out thing is a design defect because I had a soft bonnet hair dryer back in the day</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough and its not that loud.</li>
            <li>I recently have gone natural and needed an inexpensive hair dryer for my twist outs as well as hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>There are technically 4 settings, which is enough for what I need it for:  Deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, quick sets (twists &amp; braids).</li>
            <li>This can easily be repaired with a little masking tape, but if I wanted raggedy, I could have just kept using my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good quality bonnet dryer to do my deep conditioning treatments with and had researched alot of other dryers that had several complaints until I finally came across this dryer!</li>
            <li>I put it on high and hot and prayed, PRAYED that it would be dry in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict...</li>
            <li>Therefore, my positive impression was short lived.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers and the hose is long enough to reach from the bedside stand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair to wear it straight!</li>
            <li>I even tried running it on cool when the dryer itself was cool, thinking it was the stored heat in the tube and cap that was heating it up, but no... turn on a cold dryer to cool</li>
            <li>What other customers say about the heat on your neck and ears is true.</li>
            <li>It has a very large bonnet that can easily accommodate a wet set of long hair on big rollers.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out by using too much heat.</li>
            <li>The bonnet&#x27;s opening was too tight to fit over my hair without messing it up.</li>
            <li>I have long locs, which usually take a while to dry, but this dryer gets them done in about an hour/1.5 hrs, which is really great for the amount of hair that I have.</li>
            <li>No more sitting at the kitchen table under one of those super hot old school hair dryers.    </li>
            <li>It dried my natural hair super fast.</li>
            <li>like that it has a cool setting to help cool down my hair which is critical when deep conditioning so you don&#x27;t wash away all the natural and added oils and conditioning treatment</li>
            <li>The dryer has a 2 year limited warranty which should apply, but I only paid $30 for the dryer and by the time I pay postage to send the dryer back plus  add $15 more for return shipping</li>
            <li>Large enough to go over a roller set without struggle.</li>
            <li>It also has an extra large cap that fits roller sets.  </li>
            <li>bonnet is large enough for all my rollers (17 in all, 8 of them are lg, 4 med, 5</li>
            <li>The bonnet was certainly large enough to wear with rollers.  </li>
            <li>I needed a large bonnet to deep condition my hair</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large if you use big rollers.</li>
            <li>So the cap and cord and hose have little compartments that they fit</li>
            <li>It took too long and my only other option was to use a blow dryer which was not as effective.</li>
            <li>With the standard hooded dryer so much of the hot air gets out but with this soft bonnet dryer no air escaped and got my hair dry faster than normal.</li>
            <li>Would get an additional star if it had a medium setting, low is too low, and hi is really hot!</li>
            <li>I thought I wanted the hard top</li>
            <li>I was deciding between this bonnet dryer and the hard top dryers.</li>
            <li>I find I can easily sit it next to the couch and continue doing other things.</li>
            <li>So it may take longer to dry my hair, but because I&#x27;m able to still do other things</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain so much about the loudness though because of the regular blow dryer handheld is loud as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, so clearly I&#x27;ve had the dryer for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Gave two stars because she still uses the hat with her old dryer.</li>
            <li>It is too loud</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Wow, where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have waist length, naturally curly, takes-forever-to-dry hair.</li>
            <li>so far, I have had it for 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a bonnet dryer but do find it easier than the old hood dryer I had.</li>
            <li>I am a natural and needed a upright hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Laila Ali Soft Bonnet Dryer after reading some reviews, and viewing a video.  </li>
            <li>It only really dries one side of my hair at a time.</li>
            <li>I probably just never give any product top stars,  but I have nothing negative to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long extensions</li>
            <li>This  is what I need for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t not stress how loud and it is loud on every setting.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 85 yr old mother.  </li>
            <li>far as the mechanics of it, it does blow air well and does heat up for use.  </li>
            <li>When I want the natural look I scrunch my curls with curly hair product and let it have its way.  </li>
            <li>Nearly pulled off all of my rollers just trying to get it on.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my 9 year old and</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the cutest soft bonnet dryers i have seen.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waist your money and get something with a company that offers guarantee</li>
            <li>The bonnet kept flying off of my head each time I turned the dryer on and the strings to adjust the tightness of the bonnet left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud, but no louder than you&#x27;d expect a hair dryer to</li>
            <li>It is loud to the person wearing it.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m completely blown away at how my hair felt after just 15 mins of use.</li>
            <li>Especially since I have very processed hair.</li>
            <li>Not too loud either.</li>
            <li>Old style but goodie.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I often wear natural hair weaves too.  </li>
            <li>My mom was lamenting that a hair dryer just didn&#x27;t set her hair like her old bonnet hair dryer did.  </li>
            <li>I like this dryer, it is not as loud as others that I have owned</li>
            <li>My hair dries in 20 minutes and comes out soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, so if you don&#x27;t like noise don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>it makes my home deep conditioning treatments so much easier.</li>
            <li>My mother got this for my grandmother and as far as we know my grandmother uses it instead of a handheld dryer every time she puts curlers in.</li>
            <li>It was loud and noisy, gave it to Goodwill.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I use this to set my twist styles.</li>
            <li>: my hair is so soft and curly when used with rollers.</li>
            <li>IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LOUD.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m old fashioned</li>
            <li>The bonnet is big enough to fit over big curlers.</li>
            <li>I was completely expecting damp sections but found none.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money if you are in the UK.</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble hearing the audio.</li>
            <li>It works &amp; feels just like a professional salon hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient that I can sit under the dryer and sit in the bed, read, watch YouTube or even my nails without having to have a big hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I got my dryer more than 10 days late.</li>
            <li>(my hair is natural</li>
            <li>I tightened and tied the strings attached the to bonnect and had no trouble with it coming off.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is extremely loud</li>
            <li>I LUV the convenience and portability of a soft  bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>So far, this product has worked for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer after being natural for two years.</li>
            <li>: kinda too loud for me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember how I did, but it was at some point near the end of what seemed a futile search for a bonnet dryer that was sturdy (e.g., hose doesn&#x27;t fall apart after 1-2 uses) and performed well.</li>
            <li>The heat from the dryer cap can also be too much for my skin at my nape when I leave the hose connected at the back.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My other cons are that the hose gets very hot</li>
            <li>Unlike the old dryer, this dryer&#x27;s bonnet is elasticized and has a toggle tightener.  </li>
            <li>The air strength of this bonnet dryer is MUCH LOWER than the earlier model.  </li>
            <li>If this bonnet had a soft (maybe terrycloth?)</li>
            <li>Not overbearingly loud.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mom because ever since she watched a soft bonnet dryer on Tv</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo6W33EIYVSQ0G]]A comprehensive review of the Laila Ali Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer and demonstration.</li>
            <li>There was one reviewer who said that when she put the bonnet on it completely disrupted her rollers.</li>
            <li>big problem with this dryer is that the whole perimeter of the bonnet does not cinch (see video),</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color  - I am a purple fanatic.</li>
            <li>I went natural and needed to get a hood dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very compact, stands upright easily on a firm surface, and the cord storage cover is able to be closed during use allowing for convenient use and storage.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is able to be mounted to a wall and doing so would remove this negative factor.  </li>
            <li>and I find it easier to replace the dryer than to try and get the hose fixed.</li>
            <li>When I took the shower cap off, my hair was so soft and wavy.</li>
            <li>Unbearably loud.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4C African-descent hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud and it&#x27;s compact.</li>
            <li>I got this dryer for my mom  in December 2013 because  after her eye surgery she had issues with the regular dryer which exposed her eyes to too much heat.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>It would be much better if the hose were at least 1 foot longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason, I have trouble keeping the bonnet secure on my head.  </li>
            <li>A healthier method to using direct heat.  </li>
            <li>I must say that the reviews on  how to use the different heat and speed settings were very helpful.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the bonnet does continue to cover your head/hair and doesn&#x27;t slip up while drying.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer to replace an old collapsable hood dryer that was no longer working for me in regards to space.  </li>
            <li>(my old one lasted for about 10-so fingers crossed)</li>
            <li>It is loud, but does the job on my locks.  </li>
            <li>I use my soft bonnet dryer for hair treatments and for roller sets.  </li>
            <li>So far I used this on myself and 2 friends.</li>
            <li>Our hair feels soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews of this one and surprised her with it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have a bonnet dryer from the 60&#x27;s; it makes my hair so soft, but it smells like old plastic.</li>
            <li>I needed something since my hooded dryer just completely died on me.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that if you are a natural you need this.</li>
            <li>I had never used a soft bonnet dryer before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I really wish the bonnet was litttle bigger.</li>
            <li>After almost fifteen years with natural hair</li>
            <li>Def not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>This dryer is hotter than my old bonnet dryer, even on the medium setting, so the drying time is faster.</li>
            <li>I just got my soft bonnet dryer today.</li>
            <li>Its not too loud</li>
            <li>The noise is level is not too loud from my experience</li>
            <li>and the hose is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>So much easier to deep condition (DC)</li>
            <li>I needed a bonnet dryer for my 88 year old mother.</li>
            <li>The motor is not overly loud, but I did have to turn the units</li>
            <li>I really like it and will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>but so far is works like a champ</li>
            <li>Seems like a design flaw that could have been easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I USED IT FOR MYSELF &amp; MY 12 YR OLD.</li>
            <li>and I find that it dries evenly and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>is also loud on all heat settings so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(I miss my old G.E. bonnet hair dryer that is no longer made.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed to replace my old overhead dryer for the longest.  </li>
            <li>After I was able to cover my head, it only partially dried my hair and then it was time to take off the bonnet and reposition.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time in de ember and was blown away about how hot the dryer got and how quickly it dried my hair.</li>
            <li>I will revisit with update on this after few more uses because last night I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off after having it running for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it seems well made and worth the $40 I spent.</li>
            <li>I had done my research before buying it and thought that it would be a good purchase,  but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>My only minor complaint is that during the rare times I use the High air flow setting (because on Hot, it gets VERY hot</li>
            <li>I could turn it down to the lowest selection and cool my hair off.</li>
            <li>It gets my whole head dry &amp; it seems to be really hot in the back of my head.</li>
            <li>When I use the high setting, the bonnet does shift from the air pressure, but will stay in place if I actually tie the strings instead of just pulling them tight - or if I just lightly hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started out with the hottest selection to dry and then turned it down to the middle selection as the hottest selection became too warm.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using it and although it does what it is suppose to, it is either really hot or not hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have a small full service salon studio and my clients prefer this over the hooded dryer!  </li>
            <li>The beauty of it was that with the smallness of the bonnet (which had small holes here and there) the heat was easily adjustable by loosening the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s so small, it stores easily.</li>
            <li>I checked three of my rollers after the hot cycle and my hair was 97% dry.  </li>
            <li>but I usually just double tie around the whole head and then its fine.</li>
            <li>low is more slow and steady.</li>
            <li>Thankfully at least the high setting works, and it&#x27;s not too hot when the temp is set to hot.</li>
            <li>Lol idk why people are making this device to difficult!</li>
            <li>My only minor &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I did find it louder than I expected, but by no means louder than many hooded dryers.</li>
            <li>Since I have a lot of hair, I use the higher setting so that my hair will dry faster, but when it gets too hot, I switch to the low setting for a brief time.  </li>
            <li>My main use for this dryer is deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it once or twice a month for a deep conditioning treatment but when it stops working I will be going back to Sally&#x27;s and purchasing another Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>Plenty hot enough for the deep conditioning that I bought it for.</li>
            <li>However I can only use it on the low heat setting without feeling like my scalp is getting way too hot.</li>
            <li>only downfall is that the bonnet is a bit big have to tie a scarf around the edges to keep the hot air from blowing out and burning my neck or ears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has various settings but it was too hot where the hose actually attaches to the bonnet.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a decent product.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is kind of awkward at first.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once but get hot enough w/o burning my ears.</li>
            <li>With the older model I could sit close to the television and hear it when using the dryer on low speed.</li>
            <li>and I only had it on medium and those hose was hot and not log enough.  </li>
            <li>It does dry well, but it gets very hot on the high setting, and there are only high and low, and no moderate setting.</li>
            <li>It gets nice and hot and definitely cuts down the drying time on my thick natural hair.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large and is adjustable by what looks like a long shoe string for sneakers.  </li>
            <li>for locks start on high them as time progresses put it on low heat as it dries well but takes time especially if ur locs are 3 yrs and older and if they are denser.</li>
            <li>I love that it will dry my hair without the same level of damage you&#x27;d get from a drying tool such as a flat or curling iron, or one of those drying/styling brushes.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much volume, no frizz, and it really cuts down on my drying time.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon has a great return policy but very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t actually get to use the product.</li>
            <li>The cool setting is a little warmer than I&#x27;d like, but still cooler than hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i previously had a tourmaline hard bonnet dryer that I paid $150 and loved, had it for  about 4 years</li>
            <li>It has elastic all around the opening, is fuller, and the material is not as stiff as the original.</li>
            <li>It takes me back to junior high.  </li>
            <li>The dryer has 3 setting low, medium, high.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a Xmas gift and the button to turn it on low or high doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The switch doesn&#x27;t allow you to click from low to high.</li>
            <li>There are 3 heat setting, low, medium and high.</li>
            <li>If I put it up high like I did my last dryer</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that I can&#x27;t use it on high because it pops off my head.</li>
            <li>and I use it with my big rollers on the high setting.</li>
            <li>The settting for this dryer is LOW and HIGH.  </li>
            <li>It may take longer, but you could definitely burn yourself with the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>I was careful to be aware that it may get too hot and possibly shut off (some reviews about products similar to this one had that problem)</li>
            <li>I am happy with my dryer it takes less time to dry my hair no more two hours.</li>
            <li>It is not extremely loud, because I can watch TV while I&#x27;m drying my hair without having to turn up the volume to 50, and I can also hear my telephone ringing without having the phone right next to me.  </li>
            <li>actual unit is small, easy on the eyes, and hosts very convenient packing spaces for the cord, bonnet, and actual connection.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very loud, much louder than I expected.</li>
            <li>She needed light weight and small.</li>
            <li>I have decided to go natural recently and this hair dryer works very well for deep conditioning and roller setting.  </li>
            <li>Second, the hood adjusts from the back (which I like) and is comfortable but be careful not to entangle your hair in the strings because it will pull it.</li>
            <li>Im not sure it its a defect in manufacturers product or cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is pretty lightweight, though, so be careful where you place it when using it.  </li>
            <li>Ladies,  it does get hot so be careful,  cover you neck.  </li>
            <li>a little too hot when it&#x27;s on high</li>
            <li>I use it under large rollers and, in fifteen minutes my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I use large curlers and my hair is  always dry in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Like others have stated, the tube/cord gets super hot and that&#x27;s really not a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>If it breaks down in a two years or so, I still I would have got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, however, the bonnet is so large, I have to hold it the entire time I&#x27;m drying my hair and that is a real big inconvenience for me.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough for my big head and two inch rollers.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough for my big rollers.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough for a big roller set</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s big enough for lots of large rollers), so it still gets 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I used it on me and my daugter and it definelty gets hot enough to dry our natural roller styles.  </li>
            <li>It works well but not exactly looking like something that will be around for very long with the cheap construction</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the heat may not be sufficient as I have very thick, curly, African-american hair that I wear natural most days.  </li>
            <li>Although they take up more room, I&#x27;ll probably go with a hard shell next time.</li>
            <li>Will get it next week, hopes the new one is a winner.</li>
            <li>I got the new dryer about a month later</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li>The bonner covered my entire head full of large, hard rollers.</li>
            <li>Cons: too much movement causes the hose to disconnect from the bonnet and the extension cord isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li>However, on the negative side, the bonnet tends to easily detach from the hose while using it.  </li>
            <li>For me that is a fast dry.  </li>
            <li>Then the day came I needed to dry my hair pronto AND do my nails to be ready for an event.  </li>
            <li>It takes close to 2 hours for my hair to completely dry, but again it truly depends on the length of your hair (and how much patience you have...)</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and like to partially dry it in a bonnet.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
            <li>But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it Drys your hair fast but once u take your head out the dryer it seems as if it&#x27;s not as dry as u thought.</li>
            <li>Now I can dry my hair in 15 while I put on my makeup and be ready to go.</li>
            <li>even though it worked well the first time, the second time i tried to use it strange sounds and smell came out.  </li>
            <li>sure what&#x27;s the policy is with returns, but am going to return it once there&#x27;s no restocking fee:(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad because I really lone the color of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>I expect this unit will last some time, hopefully as long as my Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how much longer that&#x27;ll last and will call Helen of Troy next week to see about a replacement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer can be a bit loud, but not as loud (I don&#x27;t think) as a standard hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>My mother wants me to get her one too, so I will be purchasing a 3rd sometime in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with really corse hair.</li>
            <li>Which is very comparable to my last visit to my local salon.  </li>
            <li>on my recently colored hair - my hair (thick and shoulder length) and scalp never looked (or felt) better.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is large enough to accommodate a head full of rollers - some people complained about having to pull the ties around the edge of your face.</li>
            <li>the power level really heats up if it on high  or low switch it blow med-warm air and cool is cold if  place on hi switch and if on low it blow cool air</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the motor is very loud.</li>
            <li>it was still super hot til I put it down to low long story short ladies !</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair in less time, because it gets very hot on the high temp.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews this dryer gets hot.</li>
            <li>If only it wasn&#x27;t so loud!</li>
            <li>Love the hot and cold settings as well as high and low also.  </li>
            <li>It is hot but does not blow enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li>It gets way too hot  on the back of your head where the air comes in and doesn&#x27;t give an even dry when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>but it is hot enough to dry the hair within 30 minutes (</li>
            <li>I love this dryer,  the only down side is the wholes disconnects if you move around to much so be careful.  </li>
            <li>So next time I&#x27;ll probably just cut the time in half and use the cool setting for the remainder</li>
            <li>You have to think about where to set it up, but once you have got your spot ( with a table nearby to hold the motor near to your head ( the hose is not very long)</li>
            <li>Well, any bonnet would disrupt your rollers if you don&#x27;t secure the rollers by tying them down with one of those large black triangle net things.</li>
            <li>I always wait a few extra minutes just to make sure my hair totally dry.</li>
            <li>Bonnet fits snugly, a wet set on medium and large rollers dries thoroughly within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found that by sticking a very thin pick, think the tooth of a comb size, mine is actually a plastic spear used to stir drinks or spear olives onto, so thin it fits perfectly into the slot to lock the hole that the lock cap wants to fall out of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What turned me off was the bonnet: it seemed too big for my main purposes of usage (as a deep conditioner heat tool).</li>
            <li>When I turned it back on it only would work on the high heat setting</li>
            <li>only con...is that; when its on high the heat emanates... from the back &amp; scorches your neck a bit</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head when I use the really big jumbo rollers so I will have to use the regular large ones</li>
            <li>The drawstrings tie the bonnet very tightly, and they are very long, so someone with a smaller head than mine might be able to loop the strings around and tie it around the top to make sure it holds in place if they are unsure that the bonnet will hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet can be slightly awkward to put on if you have very long hair and are drying it loose.  </li>
            <li>whenever I do a twist-out and it cuts down on the dry time significantly.</li>
            <li>and I could never really get comfortable because I had to have it on a flat surface which really limited my options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best, but it is far, far from the worst.</li>
            <li>I generally use the low/cool setting.</li>
            <li>is a bit clumsy yet fit well.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really like how close the holes are to your actual hair so there could be potential heat damage because the hot air is directly going on your strands, but you could always put a plastic cap as a small buffer I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it is clearly made for bigger hair/rollers.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to completely secure it for small heads or short cuts like mine.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like , I find that the dryer is to loud for my comfort.</li>
            <li>What I DIDN&#x27;T like is that Amazon apparently is selling two versions of this.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>The cap barely fits  tied at its tightest and it still comes off as soon as you turn on the dryer.  </li>
            <li>even since months later the plastic ring that goes in the cap is completely detach so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white Czech girl with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I looked at several soft bonnet dryers before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li>no regrets</li>
            <li>As of today it is barely blowing anything out and the nozzle will no longer stay attached to the hood.</li>
            <li>You get enough slack to move around a bit and not too loud.</li>
            <li>My last one still works, it&#x27;s just so old (10+ years)  and beat up</li>
            <li>My only cons are that it&#x27;s LOUD, so I couldn&#x27;t watch TV while using it; therefore, I turned to my trusty Kindle Voyage to get some reading done instead.</li>
            <li>Have used once a week for the last month and my hair is so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It functions just as I had expected and the portable case is very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works very well, just how I expected.</li>
            <li>I used this dryer once so far for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>The cord is a decent length, but I usually dry my hair in my bed</li>
            <li>but, no regrets.</li>
            <li>This dryer is affordable and so far I have only been using it to steam my hair or for conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>My daughter complained that it was extremely hot in the back where the nozzle enters the bonnet and the front and sides were not as hot.  </li>
            <li>I had to stay perfectly still, and I hated it.</li>
            <li>I usually use the cool setting, I wish it had a medium setting (perhaps the newer model does?)</li>
            <li>She had a stroke and is unable to do her own hair</li>
            <li>Gets hot really fast so have a thick towel around your neck just in case.</li>
            <li>I usually keep my setting in Hot Low and then blast it to Hot High for the last 2-5 minutes to ensure that my set is dry.</li>
            <li>Upon the first time using the dryer it only worked for about 45 seconds, then it shut down completely.</li>
            <li>I used high setting for about 40 minutes and hair was almost dry.  </li>
            <li>I was using it today to dry my hair on high.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is really high quality and works well to dry my flexirod sets and braid outs.</li>
            <li>The purple case was smudged especially around switches, and overall, it just didn&#x27;t look new.  </li>
            <li>It has to be held, right at the connection, which is frustrating because it gets hot.</li>
            <li>, moved to her wheel chair instead of having to get her to a certain height for other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>Dry hair at a fast pace and wondeful for my 20-30 min deep conditioning treatments..</li>
            <li>when I diffuse my wash and gos, not only does it dry faster, my curls look really shiny</li>
            <li>My hair was really conditioned, but it left my scalp extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Like the fact that it has 3 temperature settings and the bonnet and hose can be stored right in the unit itself, so no problems with losing or missing parts.</li>
            <li>Plus this dryer takes up less space and is a pretty purple color.  </li>
            <li>My hair was dry in normal time.</li>
            <li>It normally takes about an 45 minutes to dry thoroughly even in the salon.</li>
            <li>So yes; I&#x27;d recommend, but be aware of those slight drawbacks.</li>
            <li>Previous store purchased dryer came apart where the hose couples into the hood the first time I used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done in less than 15 minutes and my hair consistently looks great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was so excited to get this cute bonnet hair dryer and to support Laila Ali, but I have to say I am disappointed.</li>
            <li>The bonnet was nice and big, it dried my hair in very little time and it is hotttttt.</li>
            <li>Although nice and compact, she had a very difficult time getting the hose in and out of the main box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it works really well.</li>
            <li>so, I really cannot compare this dryer to any other dryer.</li>
            <li>the other side.&lt;br /&gt;The heat is appropiated and its very quick.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, the hood is very roomy</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer that I could use while comfortably seated on my couch (as opposed to being perched upright in a hard chair while using my traditional hard-hood dryer).  </li>
            <li>Had a hard time opening it because I expected the latch to be at the top of the case (</li>
            <li>It is so nice to slow down enough to relax under the dryer</li>
            <li>The bonnet stays in place just by pulling the strings tight and it does not get too hot.</li>
            <li>Even though I tie the Bonnet tight, when the high/hot setting is on, hot air escapes onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>I just have to be more careful, with my clumsy self.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s on low, it doesn&#x27;t really dry the very front and very back of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was so hot in places that I could not use it long enough to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I did not move around much, and can see where using it while active might cause the hose to disengage itself.</li>
            <li>I can stuff it back in far enough to use the dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately loud and definitely has the potential to burn your ears and/or neck-</li>
            <li>One thing I wish was different is the coil(connection) gets so warm and uncomfortable, may be they can improve on that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently looking to change this hair dryer primarily because after close to two hours (granted I have thick hair)</li>
            <li>The bonnet stretches wide enough for a head full of rollers and the pull string is long enough to double wrap and tie around my head for bonnet security.  </li>
            <li>my hair was not dry..</li>
            <li>I may be jumping the gun slightly by offering up a review after only three uses of the product (maybe I should wait and see how the dryer holds up after a few months or a year), but I was so pleased with the results I thought I&#x27;d give one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m sad to say that this bonnet completely flattens my hair on top while I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
            <li>cause when you turn it on high it will blow the bonnet back a little if u put it on high.</li>
            <li>I usually just make sure that I push it away from my neck area as I settle down.   </li>
            <li>Gets a little hot though</li>
            <li>/&gt;The positioning of the holes can get a little hot after a while if you use the hot setting, but nothing a little adjusting can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>It did get a little hot</li>
            <li>This dryer is only useable at the lowest setting every other setting is simply too hot.</li>
            <li>carrying case gets a little hot.</li>
            <li>/low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty little purple casing.  </li>
            <li>Would not order another with such a large bonnet, as I have short hair, and only roll the top part in the small to medium small  rollers.  </li>
            <li>Not much difference between medium and high.</li>
            <li>But dried my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>I wrapped the string around twice and tied it in a bow but would still find the bonnet slipping off when I had the flow setting on High.  </li>
            <li>so I have to be careful because on high</li>
            <li>I was able to do a late routine, deep condition, style and still wake up with dry hair - hallelujah!  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is very large, and black, with thin straps that can be used to secure it if need be.</li>
            <li>teh noise is loud but tolerable due to teh fast dry time.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair (and braids under my sew in) super dry in a little over an hour</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the length of the average laptop but so much lighter.</li>
            <li>To me, the low is too low and medium is not hot enough and hot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use smaller curlers because I&#x27;m not really looking for curl so much as volume, and smaller ones</li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>As far as durability for the long haul... we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic smell that you get during use the first few times, it does go away.</li>
            <li>On my first use I swore it couldn&#x27;t have dried my hair in the time my blower gets the job done</li>
            <li>I have to sit it right next to me to have it reach to my head with a little bit of slack left over.</li>
            <li>The hose is a little short, had to turn bonnet sideways so it would reach even though the hairdryer was on the table right next to me.  </li>
            <li>elastic so when I attempted to pull it over my large rollers, half of them popped out, fell out of the clips or just collapsed to the floor</li>
            <li>So I can watch tv or anything really while having it on the bed without fearing it&#x27;ll burn the house down.</li>
            <li>A lot more mobile than the hard plastic type!!</li>
            <li>I like it for its small convenient size, but I wish it had a little more heating power</li>
            <li>I used to go to the salon every other week to have my hair done in either straight or curly hairstyles, but I have had to decrease my visits immensely because of financial reasons.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints are that the hose unlocks from the bonnet time to time which can be annoying and the hose gets extremely hot (duh)/ The cool setting is very cool if you use it prior to any other setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, and the shocking purple is so pretty and attractive.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t ever dry my hair completely even when I spend 1.5 hrs under this thing.</li>
            <li>I got this to dry my naturally curly hair without a hair drier.</li>
            <li>I use it to dry my hair woth my curlformers on and it fits them on completely.  </li>
            <li>Previous reviews on this product really helped my choice.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is huge which I&#x27;d prefer since I have thick, long hair (almost at my waist) and I&#x27;ll need to use XL rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much prefer that since it&#x27;s less bulky and clutsy.  </li>
            <li>I have long blonde naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a few extra dollars and get a real hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Did not dry the front of my hair like it did the back.  </li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars is that the product is not solidly made although on first few uses it works well.</li>
            <li>I purchased it about a year ago and it dries my really thick hair quickly (about 20 to 30 mins)</li>
            <li>My hair is long, so I like to use large velcro curlers (the giant, pink Conair ones).</li>
            <li>My only concern is that down the road the bonnet strap will snap because I have to tighten it very close to my head.  </li>
            <li>, I really have to pull the bonnet down low</li>
            <li>Even if I needed to reach for something nearby or turn my head to look at someone it would completely mess the whole thing up.</li>
            <li>The tube is not long enough to support it staying on the cap.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is the hose and cord are not long</li>
            <li>The hose is not long enough to have the cap on correctly.</li>
            <li>Last night I opened the bonnet up and put it on my head without curlers, but today, with the large curlers I use, I found that the bonnet is quite tight on the sides of my head and is pressing the curlers into my scalp.</li>
            <li>It only takes me 50 minutes to dry my hair in rollers, which is almost 20 minutes quicker than when I get my hair done at the salon and so far I have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>I have super thick and moderately curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY hard for me to have frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>The Laila is lightweight and easier for me to move to various areas in the house -- my previous dryer was cumbersome and heavier and hard for me to carry from place to place and took up a lot more room to store.  </li>
            <li>This thing takes FOREVER to dry my hair, no less than three hours.  </li>
            <li>I have caucasian, fine, a little longer than shoulder length, straight, hard to curl hair, and I like doing retro style wet sets.  </li>
            <li>Remove cap, shake my hair out, open the cap completely and lay it over my head on low heat for another 15 minutes to dry the roots in the middle of my head under all my hair.</li>
            <li>the only thing I hate is that the air tunnel isn&#x27;t really long other than that this is the Best!!</li>
            <li>I really purchased this dryer for my 9 year old daughter that had such a hard time sitting under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had discovered later that the high cool setting is basically the same as the low heat setting.</li>

            <li> Works great...</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Lots of great features.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The hose does not lock in to the cap well, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> If the hose would stay attached, it would be great.</li>
            <li> A great find.</li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> It is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Received timely and was in great quality.</li>
            <li> I find if I counter twist the hose, and then insert it into hood, the hose stays in great.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Product still works great.  </li>
            <li> She says it works great for her.</li>
            <li> Great product, have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> If it were not for that, it would be great.</li>
            <li> Great dryer.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m stuck with a great dryer with an ill-fitting and unwieldy bonnet.  </li>
            <li> Great bonnet dryer...</li>
            <li> but it does the job great.</li>
            <li> This dryer looks great, portable for travel and dries my hair in 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> - then I came across this dryer with its great reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great slimline.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 5 stars if it were a bit quieter, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am as happy with this bonnet dryer as I think I could ever be about any bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about this hair dryer it has a head dryer</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Great price as well.  </li>
            <li> I think you will be as happy as I.</li>

            <li> The product is great just like described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does a great job of drying my hair without torturing my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> She says it works great.</li>
            <li> This product gets a lot of happy use by her.</li>
            <li> works great, just what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The four heat settings are great.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the dryers form and function.  </li>
            <li> Portable and works great</li>
            <li> Great color and portability.</li>
            <li> I paid a great deal of money for a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for my roller sets and my hair always turns out great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> So Laila Ali thumbs up to you and your team for designing a great product.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the money...</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> I tie a hair scarf around the outer edge of bonnet to keep air from escaping and that works great for me.</li>
            <li> However while my hair is drying with the bonnet I can do my make up, pick out my clothes,  get dressed,  and even take a nap (lol).</li>
            <li> This is a great bonnets</li>
            <li> Thankfully it works out great for me.</li>
            <li> Works great but the hose connector broke off.</li>
            <li> This has been a great option.  </li>
            <li> Great compact hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The color is great.</li>

            <li> It did a great job at drying my hair &amp; my hair felt moisturized after use.  </li>

            <li> I had it out of town and it fit wonderfully in my carry on bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But what I have is still good.</li>
            <li> It is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think Laila Ali put her name on a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a really good bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you buy the ear protectors if you can find a good pair and keep a towel around your neck.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good backup, but for thicker hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>

            <li> I use larger curlers and fits perfectly, i get beautiful curls everytime.</li>
            <li> Strong, well built, great buy.</li>
            <li> great easy storing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> It is just amazing</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have to say,  this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does heat well and the adjustable heat settings are nice.  </li>
            <li> The container does not get warm either....</li>
            <li> While the dryer looks nice it has some problems.</li>
            <li> this dryer has come in handy.</li>
            <li> I like the dryer but when the cap fills with warm air it will not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that it can be so compact when you&#x27;re putting it away.</li>
            <li> Everything stores very conveniently  and the temperature settings are perfect.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> and you get WARM.</li>
            <li> The plastic tubing can get a bit warm on your neck, however, I put a towel between the tubing and my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I still honestly have no idea what this thing does.</li>
            <li> Nice length on the air duct and on the cord.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works really nicely</li>
            <li> So, I have been doing my own hair since about December 2012.  </li>
            <li> I used on medium setting and it was sufficiently warm.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that this dryer has drastically reduced my drying time.</li>
            <li> (it wraps up nicely inside the case)</li>
            <li> I have the one that opens like a clamshell and the hose kind of curls around the motor</li>
            <li> This is like being in a salon in the confines of your own home</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice dryer for a while.</li>
            <li> and I really need a quality hair dryer that will give me excellent results.  </li>
            <li> Nice try but no cigar</li>
            <li> I really liked it but does have some issues.</li>
            <li> It comes in a durable plastic case which houses the drying mechanism, and the dryer nozzle, bonnet and plug have their own tidy compartments.  </li>
            <li> maybe some kind of thermal heat resistant</li>
            <li> It dries effectively</li>
            <li> kind of like just inside of the bonnet</li>
            <li> Improvements that would be nice:  </li>
            <li> It is also a nice travel size.</li>
            <li> Nice product, does what it claims..</li>
            <li> and it is nice and warm.</li>

            <li> This dryer is great for me, but it also does a great job of keeping heat out of my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s face when I use it on her.</li>

            <li> Love Love Love this bonnet dryer!</li>
            <li> my 92 yr old mother says it is perfect, very comfortable</li>
            <li> Love it works great and get really hot!  </li>
            <li> a better bonnet for the old unit would have been awesome.  </li>
            <li> Everything fits great in the case and it really dries nicely.</li>
            <li> Stylish (love, love, love the purple color!)</li>
            <li> but its very strong and it gets hot!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift; she said it works great and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> First time using it was great .......</li>
            <li> It does get hot af after a while lol, but the cooler setting that it has works just as well.</li>
            <li> Everything was great the first two uses.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a great hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time.</li>
            <li> The bonnet fits really good and true to the temperature setting.</li>
            <li> Even on the hot/high setting, it is still very comfortable (i.e., I&#x27;m not sweating or my head doesn&#x27;t feel like it is overheating.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very comfortable with the level of heat that I get, though.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> Its very light weight and</li>
            <li> I works well, nice and portable and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> Easy to store, nice compact shape.</li>
            <li> dries my hair nicely and stores away so easily.</li>
            <li> for the first time I am winning!!</li>
            <li> Comes in a super cute case and very easily stored!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and has good air flow.</li>
            <li> I certainly appreciate the great quality in this product.</li>
            <li> bonnet is a bit large but works great.</li>
            <li> i really have to tie it very securely or it will just fly off when i turn it on.  </li>
            <li> great product huge adjustable bonnet, worth the price that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> it is a good dryer so far and the price is good.</li>
            <li> love the product</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer on 4/11 and received it the next day (which is awesome by the way).</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> By the time I got it on most rollers fell off.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to attach it permanently, which means I will no longer be able to store it.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to fold the bonnet neatly and compactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> course, the dryer makes noise, but I am easily able to watch TV or video on mobile device</li>
            <li> I just make sure the bonnet is not covering my ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I bought it, after all. :)</li>
            <li> Have taken this on trips and after a day at the beach or pool, I can still go to dinner with my hair looking fab! :-)  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love the color and everything.</li>
            <li> Once you are able to hold a pose where the tube piece does not come out of the cap, you will get the results you need.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love the portable convenience of it,  </li>
            <li> I will love it forever...</li>
            <li> I wish that the hose locked into the cap with more security</li>
            <li> :-)</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase..</li>
            <li> I love the convince of being able to move about while watching tv or reading a book etc.</li>
            <li> Although I have a steamer for that purpose I would certainly be able to use this as well.</li>
            <li> I wish it would stay on better</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my mom LOVES purple!  </li>
            <li> it works perfectly every time I use it to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re  better off getting the cordless  turban.</li>
            <li> well I like it better that air drying my hair</li>
            <li> Definitely the best hair dryer I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needs more air volume.</li>
            <li> When using, you have to be sure that you have nothing else to do but sit there.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is much more efficient, heat doesn&#x27;t escape into the air, all of the heat is directed to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it is compact, but the bonnet is a no-no.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d like to be able to put it on the floor</li>
            <li> I love the way the bonnet look and the compactness of it, After 3 uses some parts of my hair</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this thang &amp; would recommend this to any thicked haired girl in the world :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love the upgraded unit.</li>
            <li> This is great to use just out of the shower, put the cap on and proceed to get your face ready, etc.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred more space for better air flow.</li>
            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> I love the compactness and portability of this unit.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky soft, beautiful curls!  </li>
            <li> Better than that cheap bonnet attachment for the hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t cook your hair or flies off your head!  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Very happy with it and the two different settings.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love it and as a result</li>
            <li> I love it and no longer use my blow drier.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I will be purchasing my own dryer.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the conair brand.  </li>
            <li> just love this thing.</li>
            <li> Like I said I really love this thing</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and I love this ...</li>
            <li> , I love that I can just put it up when I am done..;.</li>
            <li> Who could ask it for more?</li>
            <li> Nope would continue searching for a better one.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> We all love it in my family.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and size of it.  </li>
            <li> I wish that there was a better way to adjust the cap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> So, all I can say is I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love the compact size and the performance of this dryer.</li>
            <li> I remember growing up and this was what most people used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I only wish I did a comparison video because I&#x27;m that impressed!</li>
            <li> this is another product that may stay in the box untouched in your closet most of the time.</li>
            <li> I was able to watch a movie on my laptop (using headphones)</li>
            <li> Medium is definitely more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Put the thing on your bed and make sure you have a towel around your neck</li>
            <li> I am so glad i got this dryer.</li>
            <li> but now its $11 more the</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward for this dryer, for the most part I like it</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic find!</li>
            <li> I primarily use the lowest heat setting as it provides plenty of heat!</li>
            <li> i just wish the heat was a tad bit more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> I love the amount of heated air coming out of the dryer.</li>
            <li> This was okay.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to watch tv and hear it, you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I love you can pack it all in one case.</li>
            <li> I love my dryer.</li>
            <li> in all, it looks like the version pictured on AMAZON is an improved version than from what I have, so it should be better.</li>
            <li> So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this item it works well</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> My daughters use it and they love it as well.  </li>
            <li> Dryer worked great and has a very roomy bonnet.</li>
            <li> I was able to do just that with this dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, I love the color and</li>
            <li> It looks sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very impressed with the performance and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is portable and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have used a hooded dryer for years and this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the fact that I can attach this to an extension cord and can multi task (vaccum, wash/fold laundry).</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I am able to use this dryer while seated on my couch or on a chair.  </li>
            <li> I wish the tubing was a bit longer to allow more flexibility and allow me to shift without it popping out  </li>
            <li> but I absolutely LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the four settings.</li>
            <li> wish the hose were longer&lt;br /&gt;The hose to bonnet connection needs some sort of locking mechanism to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come apart during use.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Does generate some static electricity.</li>
            <li> Get this thing a better bonnet</li>
            <li> Apart from the most fabulous shade of purple, this dryer has the power of an Ali punch!  </li>
            <li> didnt make me like drying any better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the one I used in the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love my Lalia Ali bonnet dryer cause it does the job.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this is so much better</li>
            <li> One of my favorite birthday gifts this year!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love Laila</li>
            <li> and I love purple.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Gold &#x27;N Hot&amp;#34; is a much better product</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Oh gosh, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this bonnet sauna/dryer, I use for many things: deep conditioning oils, add heat to the rollers, after wash creams &amp; lotions.. etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall is ok for the $, saved me some $ in beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> I also love how the air flow is distributed evenly over my head</li>
            <li> Lastly, I love the size of it.</li>
            <li> SO glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li> I bought it from another catalog company for about $10 more.</li>
            <li> The unit is self-contained and cute.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I received my replacement today as promised and I am completely satisfied that I received the dryer as pictured.  </li>
            <li> The quality is even a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the hose part was longer , and that the hose and cord were retractable, but I guess it would then cost more money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to use when I deep condition, and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy!</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ll have better luck than me.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> So glad I took chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than a Conair bonnet dryer....</li>
            <li> I def needed this hair dryer and love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps this from being perfect is the tube length.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer for the most part except for the hood keeps sliding off of my head</li>
            <li> The Bonnet is tighter fitting and the case with the opening lid is no more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the compartments for storage of the cord,hose and bonnet.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even know how many years ago, she wanted one.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m confident that my hair won&#x27;t be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a very big head, so the bonnet size is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be easier or more convenient.</li>
            <li> The quality is great it drys your hair fast but doesn&#x27;t burn you like most dryers.</li>
            <li> I love to use it for styling and for heat treatments.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the job, could have done it better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the reviews were spot on.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to like it</li>
            <li> but I think it is better than the high-heat curling irons/</li>
            <li> It works OK.</li>
            <li> The dryer is so neat and compact and puts out more heat than any dryer I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for deep conditioning, and for drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It would be 5 stars if the hose would stay on better</li>
            <li> We love the color too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to move it around the house with no problem.</li>
            <li> and I was able to save some money.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> SO glad I gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can tell will be able to handle plenty more sessions.</li>
            <li> I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.mend</li>
            <li> I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the style and the purple cover.</li>
            <li> I love the deign of this dryer.</li>
            <li> I find this holds hair styles better than the curling irons.</li>
            <li> This dries my most of my head when in rollers in about 45 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you have curlers in and the bonnet rests on the curlers, that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I would love a shoulder strap</li>
            <li> Aside from that...I love the product.</li>
            <li> Love how compact and portable the dryer is.</li>
            <li> It came really fast and it is great quality</li>
            <li> It does the job I bought it to do, mostly.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can take the dryer anywhere in my house.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I do find that this performs much better than the Conair dryer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I finally got it!</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this dryer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that visually I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t mind as much.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love the hood, and the compact size.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have a big head and this dryer works perfectly for drying my locs.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> so I can doze off :)</li>
            <li> so I rigged this up to an inverter to be able to defrost my windows for a winter drive</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> What I received doesn&#x27;t have a case top that opens, it is just like the Revlon and Conair models with the hose coming from the side of the case.</li>
            <li> Tried returning it but received so many hassles.</li>
            <li> and I plan on using this 6 or more times a month</li>
            <li> I love this item.  </li>
            <li> I also love how you can transport it around.  </li>
            <li> Love Laiala Ali product.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> I have to get use to the Bonnet, tying the bonnet on :-)</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It was great, my mother likes it very well.</li>
            <li> Was way better quality</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the dryer has a compartment for the hose, the bonnet and the cord - without being a flip-top design.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, product is better than stated.</li>
            <li> You will love this dryer.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here on amazon, I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love the settings.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and they love it.</li>
            <li> I was very upset and bummed, because when it worked it was great.</li>
            <li> The air seems to be concentrated in the top of your head</li>
            <li> And most of all I can take it with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I put this dryer through it&#x27;s paces and found it to be more than efficient.</li>
            <li> you can read more about how that goes at NaturalSistahs dot com</li>
            <li> make sure you keep the plastic cap.</li>
            <li> Would like it better with 8 or 10 inches added to hose.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer...</li>

            <li> no matter how many times I tried to reconnect it.  </li>
            <li> Love everything bout it.</li>
            <li> and I expect to get many years use out of it.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s comfortable and effective,  I DC more often.  </li>
            <li> It is just perfect for my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I love the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> Once you turn on the heat the air shuts to the top and blows the hood off.  </li>
            <li> It was more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>

            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> The hood itself is phenomenal for a home dryer at this price point.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this.</li>
            <li> and I Love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the versatilty of the bonnet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer</li>
            <li> The cap is very very large and will for sure cover a good size or amount of rollers.</li>
            <li> I was able to deep condition and try my hair very nicely!</li>
            <li> when you could find a decent heating cap or hair dryer for those occasions when you just want to curl up with a good book (now on your ipad) and be nice to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It dries UR hair pretty good and in no time :)</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this is a great dryer,  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight which is great and easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, easy return because all I had to do was print the label they emailed me and put the product back in the box and give to UPS man.</li>
            <li> Cool is warm.  </li>
            <li> The temperature is pretty good though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it unless it&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hose that attaches from the dryer unit onto the bonnet is a good length and it didn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it is very reliable and convenient!</li>
            <li> I use this dryer for my rollersets and ot heats up pretty good.</li>
            <li> However, the Conair I used to own had a bonnet this size and accommodated a full roller set for me with ease.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It heats up pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good dryer.</li>
            <li> with a towel it should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using the cool setting which was warm.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the heat and cool button that was kind of hiding under the air tube and</li>
            <li> Very good dryer for deep conditioning  Love it</li>
            <li> This dryer is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable and efficient!</li>
            <li> And I really love how easy it is</li>
            <li> , hair dries quickly and fits over head nicely, with or without rollers.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE SLIPS OFF SURFACES MORE EASILY</li>
            <li> This would not be an issue if lid latch were more sturdy or had a reliable, strong hold-open option.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is purple and so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Plus it is cute and compact so it stores easily.</li>
            <li> I love how the equipment is all together and easy to carry from one place to another.</li>
            <li> If you are just wanting to just dry your hair, your best bet is a blow dryer as the bonnet was designed for use with curlers.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is portable, can be easily set up anywhere.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit with the jumbo rollers I purchased, but I was able to wear the bonnet with 18 jumbo curlers on my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that when I roll my hair that the rollers will make up for the extra space and the cap will fit perfectly then.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will enjoy it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is great &amp; not damaging on my natural curls!</li>
            <li> the warm setting, the hose gets hot, but it is not uncomfortable and it might be nice in the winter to have the warm hose on my arm.</li>
            <li> Also the amazing thing is,is that the tube that puts heat in the head dryer is insulated so it won&#x27;t burn the tube or even feel hot!</li>
            <li> The bonnet seems to be mostly designed for those who are doing huge roller sets.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I can sit where ever I want to sit.</li>
            <li> One more thing, The cord that contact to the bonnet kept falling off although I head a clicking sound when I attach it.  </li>
            <li> Best money spent.</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with the quality and hot temp.</li>
            <li> The dryer is also light weight &amp; though this should not matter, it is also stylish.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great as far as the motor.</li>
            <li> love the fit.</li>
            <li> I can see myself getting a great deal of use out of it whether my hair is in a weave or natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to my natural hair styling products.</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> I think the hose connector could have a more secure mechanism to stop the hose detaching</li>
            <li> elastic headband, it would have been much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Product performed as expected and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> one is portable and works great for this purpose and also for drying with curlers (kinda old school</li>
            <li> great product so far.</li>
            <li> Ideally I would like the bonnet a bit bigger</li>
            <li> I love this product, it so compact and light weight.</li>
            <li> which I love, I don&#x27;t like them being cheap with the heat.</li>
            <li> I love that it is compact, all the pieces fit in their place and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Love the light weight of this dryer.</li>
            <li> I chose this product, for the convenience first; I liked the idea of being able to unplug the bonnet to take breaks from drying, or if I needed to do something else.  </li>
            <li> I did have issues with the hose constantly becoming un-attached from the bonnet</li>
            <li> Brand new in the box perfect thanks.</li>
            <li> It worked well, got very hot, was compact and very easy to store.  </li>
            <li> Most impressed with its large bonnet (plenty big for many jumbo rollers) and the tie that secures the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> The original one pretty good</li>
            <li> All in all so far I love it!!</li>
            <li> The Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer has come in very handy.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is awesome!</li>
            <li> I took the advice of other reviewers and tied the strap under my chin and it stays on perfectly.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is full size and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the product is lightweight, easy to carry and store and can be tucked away in a suitcase when you have to just go.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s easily remedied by wearing a scarf when using this dryer.</li>
            <li> so I can easily move around...</li>
            <li> It easily fits under the cabinet or under the bed.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble not to noisy</li>
            <li> The bonnet is so roomy and easy to store.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> : Easy Setup, some even air flow, compact, the price (under $40).&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> There could be more room for hood storage but it will fit in the space available.  </li>
            <li> but it was done very quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can switch the heat settings easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and does the job everytime.  </li>
            <li> This dryer works great on my curly hair, the only problem is, since I&#x27;m not using curlers, it flattens the hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put up and tuck away.  </li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use, efficient, well-priced, and</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this thing, great for my DC&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it would be easy or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and assemble, its  efficient and stores neatly in my closet.</li>
            <li> The cap fits easily over my rollers.</li>

            <li> The hose is easy to connect and disconnect from the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  </li>
            <li> The air scape easily</li>

            <li> The first being that part where the cap connects to the tube gets really warm</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty handy</li>
            <li> But, looking over the other products available, it seemed to be my best bet with regard to cost and portability.</li>

            <li> Its easy to clean and easy to put away.</li>
            <li> It heats very quick and overall is a great product.</li>
            <li> You will also need to keep a towel around your neck as my neck heats up quickly and the tubing gets very hot...not a good feeling when it rubs up against your neck or shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient easy to store doesn&#x27;t take up much space fits nicely in my closet.</li>
            <li> I also use it to deep condition our hair, I love that it&#x27;s travel friendly and compact!!!  </li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a great product, light and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Fine a comfortable spot and relax.  </li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer has been the best thing for my hair as it dries super fast and making my hair soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago and feel in love the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i can still move around with this dryer since its sort of like a huge hat.</li>
            <li> This product works well with the huge flexi rods (purple/gray).  </li>
            <li> Laila Al cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is huge</li>
            <li> The bonnet is huge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used extra long/wide curlformers and flexirods; both fit great.</li>
            <li> And this is a huge asset in my hair care regime.</li>
            <li> and I can roll my hair and still have room in the huge bonnet.</li>
            <li> I have a big head (lol), and with the rollers I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit, but it did.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of laila dryers until they switched the design.</li>
            <li> And, the part on the hose end that connects it to the bonnet seemed like cheap plastic that might break.</li>
            <li> I really like how the attachments has their own space.</li>
            <li> Great for wrap and go, curlers, deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Overall great product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> As for sound..</li>
            <li> The cons are the hose keeps falling out of the cap, the bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit quite</li>
            <li> So comfortable and efficient.</li>
            <li> After tightening it to it&#x27;s limit, it still didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I use it with a plastic cap for deep conditioning and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bonnet, hose, and power cord all fit in the case for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of them was a gift and the person liked it so much I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> but the person I gave this to as a gift was not as fortunate.</li>
            <li> But it leaves it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous for conditioning hair and for curls.  </li>
            <li> What a fantastic job</li>
            <li> Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I am soooooo happy I finally bought it</li>
            <li> Really simple and works great.</li>
            <li> is great for deep conditioning...</li>
            <li> Great bonnet to use for deep conditioning, and drying twist out styles</li>
            <li> Also the bonnet uses a shoestring type tie which is sturdy and helps keep the bonnet secure.</li>
            <li> I found that it does a great time maintaining optimal heat levels under the bonnet and has no problems with getting entire head heated, even nape area.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It took just a bit of maneuvering to get it over, but it does fit.</li>
            <li> The darn thing worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> I close the lid some, to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can sit comfortably while wearing it anywhere, even in bed.</li>
            <li> I have huge rollers and it fit under the cap.</li>
            <li> they fit.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning with heat.</li>
            <li> But, I use it for pre-pooing and deep conditioning and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still playing around with how to keep it on my head in a comfortable way without it falling off.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great dryer that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li> Fit all my hair with room to spare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and so compact.</li>
            <li> Pros: compact, everything in one place, all items fit into case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer, except for the connection to the actual dryer from the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> My jumbo rollers fit with no problem.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that the dryer is also grat for deep conditioning and works well even over another steam cap.</li>
            <li> My problem with it is the hose to the hair bonnet, it doesn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li> Its portable, light and it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> really does nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> it is quite comfortable</li>
            <li> But the advantages of drying the hair and keep your hands free compensate everything.</li>
            <li> There is also an adjustable drawstring which helps you fit it to your head.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A CHEAPLY MADE DRYER BY A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN HAIR TOOLS.  </li>
            <li> This thing is cheap.  </li>
            <li> The case seems a bit cheap, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel any air escaping from anywhere it shouldn&#x27;t once the bonnet is secure</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but the parts are really cheap</li>
            <li> It should fit a roller set</li>
            <li> Please make it available or let me know where I can purchase it alone.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer works great for my weekly deep conditions!</li>
            <li> I had to play around with it for a minute to get comfortable.</li>
            <li> It did fit over my rollers, and stayed on for the hour I used it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> but there is no locking mechanism or anything to firmly secure it in place</li>
            <li> I make it work for me by keeping my movements to a minimum and holding the hose to my body with my available arm.</li>
            <li> It may take a bit longer, but I can be hands free to use my computer or read.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, drys my hair fully.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the tube is way too short.  </li>
            <li> the storage is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Ideal for wet sets.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a plus that I can sit comfortably on my sofa.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and the temperature settings make it great to use on kids and adults.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap and</li>
            <li> Works great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the hose conector is cheap.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is cheap.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable.</li>
            <li> The hose stays securely attached to the bonnet if you turn it to a its locking position.</li>
            <li> air intake away from me to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap and so is the product.  </li>
            <li> All of the accessories fit inside the purple case.</li>
            <li> A great replacement to the big hooded dryer.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The cap fits snug and it snaps onto the tube so that it will feel and look secure.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister use this so much that she decided to get her own.  </li>
            <li> I got this on time &amp; it is great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bonnet and very portable.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, but loud</li>
            <li> Works great ,compact thanks so much, Debi</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a good soft bonnet cap dryer for a while, then i stumbled across this one.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were impressed with how much quieter it is compared to our last one.</li>
            <li> So far, so good-</li>
            <li> I love it so much I brought 2 one for me and one for my neice that love it also</li>
            <li> But for me,after using the hot setting for 45 min, the cool setting is nice.  </li>
            <li> I use high/hot for 10 minutes and then 10 minutes on high-low and within 20 minutes of sitting under my soft bonnet - reading a book, doing a crossword, my hair is soft, bouncy, shiny, and I am so, so happy with it!  </li>
            <li> the cool setting is warm and the hot gets really hot!!</li>
            <li> This dryer is perfect for me because it dries my thick hair quickly (about an hour, which falls into my normal drying range at the salon) without a great deal of heat.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s nice and hot, dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new look, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the version I received.</li>
            <li> Took me about a minute to make sure I had the cap on right</li>
            <li> Easy to read temperatures settings (4 settings from cool to hot).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This works well and gets really hot!!</li>
            <li> When I took the bonnet off, my shower cap was holing on to so much heat!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping to Europe was amaizing fast!!!</li>
            <li> Now if I could figure out a way for a machine to straighten my hair while I&#x27;m sitting here instead of me spending an hour blowing my hair straight - that would be a miracle!!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, very nice resullts.</li>
            <li> Its super comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to store in addition to drying my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I love having both my hands free while drying and if you really want/need to multi-task its easy to twist off/on the heat cord from the bonnet.</li>
            <li> One quick turn of your head and it could easily fall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to Use, Dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it the best bonnet on the market shipped fast too, and the color purple and black rocks with all my accessories</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and is so compact it&#x27;s easy to store away.</li>
            <li> It is also very flimsy in my opinion as it tips over very easily.</li>
            <li> It has worked really well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I took it with me on a weekend getaway, it is very easy and fast to set up, then pack away.  </li>
            <li> New favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> Over all this is an AMAZING hair dryer I HIGHLY recommend getting this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who does their own hair at home or to travel around.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and the large bonnet is great for me since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li> However, I am happy with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it leaves it silky, smooth and shine</li>
            <li> I *struggled* to get the bonnet to fit over a head full of rods.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money !</li>
            <li> I just put a towel around my neck to keep the hot hose from touching it</li>
            <li> When I received the dryer yesterday, I was excited to try it out today.</li>
            <li> Gets real hot.</li>
            <li> The bonnet on this dryer DID fit over my head full of Jumbo sized roller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really excited to use this for whatever else</li>
            <li> Like the first time I used it, I was sorting hair products on the floor, and was able to move around with ease.</li>
            <li> Am very satisfied with the soft Bonnet Dryer</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that I don&#x27;t feel hot because the heat is concentrated within the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I was so excited because it is portable</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I had a full head of 2 inch rollers on and it fit over them quite well.</li>
            <li> Small things I can deal with, but a great dryer, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it so much!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to come, but It was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I am excited to use the dryer.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> i was excited that their were 3 heat settings.  </li>
            <li> This device is very light, easy to carry around, easy to store, easy to use, easy to clean and something she will definitely make me repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bonnet is made of nice material and so far everything is holding up and working just fine.</li>
            <li> I choose to try this one due to its great reviews on several websites and I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase ^_^</li>
            <li> So I have been new to maintaining my own hair instead of going to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> The one I received does not look like this, and to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the new one.</li>
            <li> This dryer is perfect for me because I natural and have low perosity hair (naturals will understand this).  </li>
            <li> This kind of defeats the purpose of being able to do something else, such as read a book, while the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lightweight, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Especially for natural hair girls perfect to set your curls and avoid heat damage.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it up but then decided to ask for an exchange which was no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> The heat is perfect for me and felt good on a cold winters day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once; so far its working PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hood dryer that was powerful and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I like how you have a warm and a hot, but hot</li>
            <li> Secondly the tube is hot and was sitting against my neck, if you wear a scarf you will be fine, lol.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably on your head and it is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft bonnet for a while, so glad that I found it!</li>
            <li> Other than that it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Hot is Hot, and the Cool is nice and Cool.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and drys really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, drys my hair quickly and safely and it was totally reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it right now as we speak!</li>
            <li> This dryer gets so HOT that I had to turn down the heat which was SUPER IMPRESSIVE.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight, has a long cord which allows for movement while your doing your treatments, and my favorite thing about it is that it came in a cute purple case that is easy to store.</li>
            <li> - everything cools off quickly and can be replaced without bulging or popping out of their original storage</li>
            <li> I used it mostly on medium heat as the high heat can get really hot, but I&#x27;m glad that I have that option.</li>
            <li> I used it on the cool/low setting and my hair is sooo amazingly silky soft.</li>
            <li> I like being able to be mobile while drying my hair so that makes it pretty worth while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third - this is the most important - this dryer does not create uncomfortable hot spots which burn your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally - the case is well made, stylish and a joy to use ( I LOVE the color)</li>
            <li> It is very portable and gets nice and hot.</li>
            <li> good but hose is short</li>
            <li> It seems to be good quality and solid construction.</li>
            <li> Good for deep conditioning, rollersets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what others have said, put a towel around your neck or feel the burn.  </li>
            <li> Also the hose is a bit short but still good to work with.</li>
            <li> (Cool has no heat.)  </li>
            <li> It was good to finally find a bonnet type for her.  </li>
            <li> there is also a cool setting.</li>
            <li> I love that this is so gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a drier that could heat and cool, not just another heated head wrap.</li>
            <li> so I unplugged it and let it cool off for about 7 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the compact, common sense hose, bonnet and cord storage</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to two strand twist my hair, sit under a dryer and be ready to go in an hour</li>
            <li> Very convenient love it.</li>
            <li> Cool hair dryer with bonnet.</li>
            <li> I really liked the old unit, save for the craptastic bonnet....</li>
            <li> The slightest turn of the head will cause it to drop out UNLESS THE SETTING IS ON COOL</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a bonnet dryer that had a true cool setting.  </li>
            <li> and so I had to shut it off for minutes at a time to let my head cool.  </li>
            <li> It took about 10 minutes for the shower cap to cool off (I was testing to see).</li>
            <li> Overall, for the money it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair as if I was in a Salon and works good for deep conditioning my hair as well!</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a good dryer, kind of loud</li>
            <li> but I swear it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I love the convinience and it is really powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember when simple was good and just ...worked.</li>
            <li> It really limits being able to do anything else while drying.</li>
            <li> If you expect good, space efficient design and a quiet motor, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed with that because i have thick hair</li>
            <li> On goes the bonnet, I hit the cool setting and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The settings seem to be true to their description.  </li>
            <li> my teenage girls laughed at me.lol.</li>
            <li> not a bad price either..</li>
            <li> but overall i find it very good and have found my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but I love it so far!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, strong material, easy to store, I bought 2 conair but the bonnet is very light, the hose is not a good material and it stopped when it gets</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful, compact, comfortable (considering what it is) and exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one ever the only reason I give it a 4 star is because the tube constantly falls of the cap other then that it leaves your hair beautiful</li>
            <li> Its very convenient, light weight, easy to use and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easily transportable and tucks away without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> Right off, I noticed the hose does not stay securely in the bonnet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and it has adjustable heat settings so that it always feels just right.</li>
            <li> Actually my daughter saw me using it and said how cool it was, so I will be purchasing another for her!!!</li>
            <li> This dryer is so pretty with the purple case and everything fits inside so it can travel easily.</li>
            <li> This is a strong, hot dryer.</li>
            <li> Yes the hose can come undone from the hood pretty easy if your&#x27;e moving around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair and have to wash and deep condition every week; being able to do this in the comfort of my living room is really great and has been worth the money paid for the dryer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Also, the bonnet is quite large (roomy enough for all my hair) and the drawstring in addition to the elastic band is great.</li>
            <li> Extra large bonnet which is great.</li>
            <li> the controls are very easy to use and the hot hair really gets out.</li>
            <li> and I had to put a towel under the plastic piece but other than that it did great.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> I got the merchandise quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is nice and big and has a cinch on it to make it fit.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this bonnet, so much better than that big plastic one you see in the salon.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It works great, the only downfall is that it is very noisy when in use.</li>
            <li> The bonnet quickly attches and detaches if needed.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love it 100 times better than my traditional bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, and my hair is silky smooth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quickly dries my hair in rollers in 20 min or so.</li>
            <li> Convenient and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This drying helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> my husband says I have a peanut-sized head - and the hose could be a bit longer, but it works well and my hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Finally, this item does the job exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning and dries my hair really fast.</li>
            <li> It cools off quickly after use.</li>
            <li> The cool setting is cool, not cold.</li>
            <li> As most of the reviews state, you do have to play with the edges a bit as when on high</li>
            <li> You are able to keep the dryer on High without burning your scalp.</li>
            <li> It may be more resistible when having rollers on, will try it on high it &amp; see.</li>
            <li> I found that my ears start to burn if I have it on high for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was persistent because it wasn&#x27;t that easy to find and there was so many other choices.</li>
            <li> Was not confident it would work like a conventional dryer, but it works just as good and the convenience is priceless.</li>
            <li> the beginning, it was a struggle to find a way to let the bonnet rest comfortably without the hot air</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just have a big head, and won&#x27;t be able to get the bonnet to fit with my huge curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and seem to be comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well,  light weight, portable, dries my hair fast, and it reminds me of the old days when you did your own hair at home.</li>
            <li> It get Very hot</li>
            <li> 1)style hair as desired or just detangle as normal 2) turn or Netflix or your favorite show 3)</li>

            <li> Also, the hose gets very hot when its running...</li>
            <li> Gets very hot (will not burn or anything like that)</li>
            <li> Comfortable and fast drying time!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot,  burns your ears if you don&#x27;t cover them.  </li>
            <li> When I put it n &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; it gets very hot</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very hot to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that some things just do what they are supposed to do without having to have electronic dials and digital displays.</li>
            <li> The first two were cheap garbage.  </li>
            <li> Heat gets very Hot and begins to burn neck and ears-</li>
            <li> The casing is beautiful and is not cheaply made</li>
            <li> I mainly use this hair dryer when i apply deep conditions to my hair and its great.</li>
            <li> I can fit a full head of bouffant (large) curlers in the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m certain I could easily fit over head full of rollers if I tried.</li>
            <li> Dryer has 2 settings Hot or cool it really get HOT, real hot :-)</li>
            <li> She can finally dry her dreads beautifully under bonnet and can watch a movie at the same time :).  </li>
            <li> Also, the hot setting is that ... HOT!!</li>
            <li> Also, could not find a way to get in touch with the mftr to request a new hose fitting.  </li>
            <li> hot.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I love my new one.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair so quickly and the soft bonnet is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to set up...took me a while to get the hang of getting the hose in and out but everything easily fits right back in for easy storage.</li>
            <li> The fact that it takes less than a minute to set it up and pack it away without any hassle is a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair dry heats up good.  </li>
            <li> The compact dryer is very convenient and easy to store away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use very compact.</li>
            <li> Switching it to cool occasionally is also nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Dryer is very compact easy to store vs. hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> So to me that&#x27;s a good sign because you don&#x27;t have to worry about this dryer not getting hot enough.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very portable and easy to put together.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; dries quickly; very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li> When I do use it, the heat is fine and it fits over my large rollers.  </li>
            <li> probably a lil too hot!</li>
            <li> it was HOT!</li>
            <li> I did not have to use ANY pomade for the first time ever!  </li>
            <li> This is an attractive, lightweight, and efficient old fashioned soft bonnet dryer, which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this dryer in November I was beyond excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Using the dryer at first sucked!</li>
            <li> ALso, the bonnet tube that the air travels in gets REALLY HOT!</li>
            <li> This dryer gets HOT!</li>
            <li> , I never use it, I don&#x27;t know how can anyone resist it &amp; for what use they designed it on that much heat!!</li>
            <li> Having to do this kinda defeats the purpose of sitting under a dryer in the first place!  </li>
            <li> It is hot and does what it is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li> designed this dryer really knew what they were doing!!</li>
            <li> and it dries sooo fast!!</li>
            <li> TOO HOT - even on medium!</li>
            <li> Very compact, easy to store and powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is perfect for those who want to quickly dry up their styles or deep condition treatments.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair really quick however, and I&#x27;m happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries your hair fairly quickly once you figure out how to use the hot and cool settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little giant, compact, heats great, took in my Mediterranean cruise and it worked fine, it can be moved easily, I can work comfortably while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I had a Sasson bonnet dryer and the soft bonnet was very cheap and the nozzle attachment ripped.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet top is large and will work with even large rollers.  </li>
            <li> I love this.....dries my hair in minimum time; I have relaxed shoulder length hair not very thick.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large so you can fit a lot of hair even with rollers.  </li>
            <li> However, I use large rollers in my hair, and the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t easily fit over them.</li>
            <li> fits comfortably over my rather large head.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t get a good tight fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use right away and shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The hose could be just a LITTLE bit longer and it would be great if the lid opened all the way</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I am still figuring out the best way to dry my hair right above the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> A nice bonus over a regular dryer is that your ears don&#x27;t get hot!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Cord does get hot when heat is on high.</li>
            <li> Very compact and light weight</li>
            <li> Plus the results were great a and all of my hair was dried.</li>
            <li> An amazing product that I use weekly for my deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works really well, but it is CHEAPLY MADE.  </li>
            <li> except the body is to light fall over way to much....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but this works great.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> So far tthis product has worked perfectly and the o ring is still firmly attatched to the hood.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i am really enjoying my tonic soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely keep a towel handy just in case your ears start burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing my own henna hair color at home to save time and $, so this dryer is key to getting the color to bond to the hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I had spent more money and bought a better product.  </li>
            <li> the machine did not seem to run properly as it went on and then stopped and then started again all on its own.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as loud as a blow dryer and was able to sit in my recliner and watch t.v while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is is compact and lightweight -- I take it on business trips -- and it is still powerful.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$$$.</li>
            <li> The hose and electric cord both push back into the carry motor which is really nice.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I must say that this hair dryer has truly proven to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> low was plenty warm.  </li>
            <li> Powerful dryer, but the cord does not stay attached to the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I might try finagling the bonnet and wear it in a different direction to see if it&#x27;s more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the motor&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only owned the dryer for a couple of months, but so far, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> : LOUD, could use more air flow in the front of the head.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much because it was a soft bonnet dryer</li>
            <li> I recently discovered using Jumbo sized rollers to straighten my hair (and the rollers leave nice, bouncy curls and the ends).</li>
            <li> It was warm, but I also had a sweatshirt on to protect my back.</li>
            <li> stack your pillows on you bed to prop your back comfortably 4)plug in your dryer and assemble now enjoy!</li>
            <li> i LIKE THE OLD MODEL BETTER.  </li>
            <li> Pros are it has four settings and a powerful fan.  </li>
            <li> the unit has cool or hot.</li>
            <li> I set it on the warm and thats usually enough heat for me.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Helps me move them out faster... will be useful until they can use hair dryers themselves.</li>
            <li> Truly wasn&#x27;t or isn&#x27;t worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the&lt;br /&gt;cost.</li>
            <li> I love the soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s cool setting is almost hotter than on hot.  </li>
            <li> but I love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for ladies who do rollersets or the like, but I&#x27;m not there in the hair game yet</li>
            <li> Both sessions with the bonnet were a success, and I am sold.</li>
            <li> I used it to deep condition my hair and was happy that it wasn&#x27;t too loud so that I could use my headphones with it</li>
            <li> , temps gets really hot even the cool settings... ?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got 2 settings and the low is still warm enough to use if the HI is too warm for you.</li>
            <li> it is so much more comfy than the old faithful</li>
            <li> and I spend a lot of time straightening it because I think it looks more polished and professional when I do.  </li>
            <li> I was glad that this did not make a ton of noise as the old hair dryer I had scared my one cat.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money I have saved by not having to frequent a salon :).</li>
            <li> love this product and it really made my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I needed a soft bonnet dryer, and  so far so good.</li>
            <li> and after, I am just bouncing, moisturized and healthy looking and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient yet powerful.</li>
            <li> still use it frequently and love to set my curlers with it</li>
            <li> I like that it has three different setting; from cool, warm, and hot.</li>
            <li> I use my dryer to condition my hair, so for me the most comfortable setting is (low).</li>
            <li> I like the hot and cool settings and the bonnet</li>
            <li> It has 2 settings: hot and cool.</li>
            <li> So far I like this hair dryer very easy to carry and everything fits right into to side compartments at first</li>
            <li> It was great at first, and then for some reason the airflow slowed down, and the bonnet wouldn&#x27;t fill up like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> First thing I notice was the packaging is completely new and when I investigated the actual dryer I smiled because it was what I wanted :)  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is really great, if you are not a professional hairdresser but want a hairdryer at home I would strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have honestly had vacuum cleaners that were quieter than this thing.  </li>
            <li> barely takes up any space, extremely stylish, dries hair very quickly, the front of your hair doesnt get as much heat</li>
            <li> Came quickly, works well, fits a bit funny.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, the bonnet has a drawstring so it stays put even when delivering hot air.</li>
            <li> I like the mobility of this though and the lowest setting is super hot.</li>
            <li> This gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> I usually lay it stacked on top of a sturdy box and that on top of a TV tray so that in front of me, I have another tray situated to either use my tablet and or use this as a perfect time to do my nails since I am seated for at least 30/40 minutes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair was completely dry (when air drying takes 2 full days) in 30 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome dryer, I get my hair dry within an hour, rather than having to air dry for 8+ hours.</li>
            <li> Because it is so strong, the bonnet, when the dryer is on high, wants to blow right off your head!</li>
            <li> Nothing good to say about this other than they should stop making it.</li>
            <li> It dries well at lower heat settings as the higher are very hot.</li>
            <li> Regular hand held dryer took too long and didn&#x27;t really get them dry.&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> After re-twisting or a wash this is perfect for getting every single loc dry and set in all types of styles.</li>
            <li> Even with all those large rollers in, it is easy for me to get the bonnet over the rollers as it is quite large.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing natural hair for about a year and have found this product very handy to dry my hair quickly when needed.  </li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Can you believe the hose melted and fell right off.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I am not doing something right.</li>
            <li> The temperature is just right</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago and by looking at it wasn&#x27;t too encouraged to try it right away.  </li>
            <li> It can slide right under you bed, closet, cabinet, or on a shelf.  </li>
            <li> I have to angle it right, but it does</li>
            <li> The price was just right for it</li>
            <li> so it keeps coming right out.</li>
            <li> right?...</li>
            <li> It does disturb the rollers, and is right once all the way on.</li>
            <li> am using it right now after washing and wrapping my hair.</li>
            <li> The temperature is just right for conditioning.  </li>
            <li> , the hose snaps into the bonnet if I twist in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I feel like she has values and would do the right thing and that she did.  </li>
            <li> the hot setting was too hot but the the cool setting was just right.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer is so handy especially when doing a hot oil treatment it braid out.</li>
            <li> You get warm or hot air only.</li>
            <li> Amazon were top class because they refunded the full price when they actually didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Third it is space efficient and easy to clean off hood and case with mild soap and</li>
            <li> Individuals with larger than average heads or those using it for roller sets will find this bonnet a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise</li>
            <li> This has to be the best $$$$ I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Light, easy to use, powerful enough, affordable.</li>
            <li> The elastic around the bonnet is adjustable, so it will fit everyone from a child, to an adult with a head full of rollers.</li>
            <li> wished it will streatch a little more to be more flexiable but over all pretty cool</li>
            <li> It does get hot on high!!!</li>
            <li> The first one was defective - started smoking the first time I use it!  </li>
            <li> The HOT setting was too hot for me even with my ear shields on!  </li>
            <li> this isa great dryer to have the bonnet is huge you can be stress free if you have long thick hair and user large rollers they will fit!</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer, It really does the job.....</li>
            <li> The hood is very large as well.</li>
            <li> I find that it is very large and even though I  adjust it to my head by pulling on the strings it has some difficulty staying on.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is very large and fits over my rollers with no problem.</li>
            <li> The bonnet fit easily into a compartment next to the hose&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Works well to dry hair in twists etc...not ideal for big fros</li>
            <li> The dryer is very convenient to move around, it dries very well, and it is easy to attach and put up.  </li>
            <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t have the bonnet included in the box, but Amazon sent me out another one pretty quickly</li>
            <li> It does get hot pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do that with a hard top dryer! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet, I can even watch TV while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair :-)</li>
            <li> The speed can be set to low or high, the temp cool or warm (this button also has an off position so it doubles as the power button).</li>
            <li> The bonnet fits in a kind of mohawk or Portuguese man o&#x27;war (jellyfish) shape (tall at the middle of the top, short at the sides).</li>
            <li> I wore my wet set finished hair Christmas Eve, looked just as good the next day on Christmas Day, and I&#x27;m still wearing today in more relaxed waves.  </li>
            <li> Was not expecting this dryer to be so hot or powerful.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the general operation of the unit...</li>
            <li> It has hi and low velocities and hot and cool air, so I can use it how i feel more confortable.</li>
            <li> The cool is really just lukewarm, which I like cause a lot of heat gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick (and my head&#x27;s kind of big lol)</li>
            <li> The hot and warm setting felt the same HOT.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a pretty good dryer</li>
            <li> It has a nice long hose</li>
            <li> Other than that, pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> I love that I am not limited to sitting at s table trying to find the right height.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality and super comfortable and very convenient to store in my NY apartment.</li>
            <li> because the cool setting is too low and the hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Order yours today and let your hair grow by using this product to do montly deep hair conditioning, great for roller setting Laila Ali&#x27;s Bonnet is  surpreme for all hair types dread,braids, naturally free, and other racs of hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and its just the right size.</li>
            <li> Everyone was right when they said it got hot on their necks.</li>
            <li> First, I must say right off that I haven&#x27;t even opened the box</li>
            <li> It is extremely hot, which is great, but it is too small for flexi rods.</li>
            <li> A compact, easy to carry and use hair dryer for those of us who still roll our hair the old fashion way.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to return it, but the returning process seemed like more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li> but so far so good on the visual side.</li>
            <li> It also seems great for deep conditioning that will be my next test ...</li>
            <li> I can quickly use it while I&#x27;m still getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> So I was going to say it would be good for naturals who wet set and want to speed up the drying process without really using heat....</li>
            <li> Portable and right amount of heat on high or cool settings.  </li>
            <li> It is very loud and made of cheap plastic; I though the hose was going to break off when I was trying to pull it out.  </li>
            <li> other than that I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> I thought for sure this bonnet would only be suitable for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Gets extremely warm, so no problem with getting your hair dry in a reasonable amount of time!  </li>
            <li> WHY CAN&#x27;T SOMEONE MAKE A DECENT PORTABLE BONNET DRYER?!?!</li>
            <li> Very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> None of the heat escapes the bonnet for me and it&#x27;s very comfortable to keep on for the 20-30 minute deep condition I do.</li>
            <li> It works very fast and my daughter uses it as well</li>
            <li> It has behaved very very well up to now.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable, too, compared to products I had seen in area beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I Thank You Very Much.</li>
            <li> The low sitting was very hot and the cool sitting was cool air</li>
            <li> setup is super easy, only within a minute.</li>
            <li> Had it on high cool.  </li>
            <li> There is a high/low buttons that can be used cool high/low or heat high</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; hair dryer, but this one is great.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find and this one does the  job just great.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and the cool setting is great for natural hair so that you can dry a style without necessarily using heat.</li>
            <li> Strong air flow but got very hot even in the low setting.</li>
            <li> I love that it has high, medium, low and cool settings.</li>
            <li> This soft bonnet is very large and fits my large size rollers just fine.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;thing, it should be fine once I use it a few more times and get it tied right.</li>
            <li> Which is a huge bonus for busy college student like myself.</li>
            <li> ;) try it.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask, especially at this price?</li>
            <li> Dryer gets hot but the tubing where the heat goes through is too hot for the neck area because it falls on the neck and shoulder area.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li> The bonnet/hose connection would not stay connected within the first couple months of owning this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Also the hit setting is exactly that...</li>
            <li> It might take some adjusting to stay on and it is sometimes really hot where the hose is.</li>
            <li> WELL, my first order of disgust was to discover the bonnet does not have a drawstring.  </li>
            <li> After the effort it took to get it on the first time, I just gave up and held the hose and pointed it at my head.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Gets extremely hot on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> where Bc it looks like a suitcase at first</li>
            <li> Malfunctioned on the first use</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is that it gets so hot that you need to put a towel or something around your neck.</li>
            <li> Gets extremely hot on medium setting..</li>
            <li> and it get really hot</li>
            <li> I find it better to put the hose part to the side in stead of the back so that the heat wouldn&#x27;t burn your neck.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a HOT BUY (literally) and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets too hot (even on the medium setting)  where the hose enters the bonnet and does not distribute the heat around to the front.</li>
            <li> It did get pretty darn hot around where the hose attaches.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot and fits over just about any style.  </li>
            <li> The elastic gathered in the front was a bit uncomfortable otherwise a perfect item.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as I would like</li>
            <li> I use the medium setting and it&#x27;s pretty hot.</li>
            <li> after that it gets too hot for me.</li>
            <li> First time the dryer didn&#x27;t want to turn off while it was hot and no</li>
            <li> but I just tried to use it for te first time and it started smelling of burnt plastic.</li>
            <li> love the deep purple color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get pretty hot</li>
            <li> This dryer is made very well!</li>
            <li> , I flipped the dryer to the low setting just to make sure I was correct that it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot on your ears.  </li>
            <li> And on the first use the hose broke.</li>
            <li> I set my hair for Christmas Eve today and used this dryer for the first time, with plastic rollers and Elan setting lotion.  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> This is my first bonnet dryer, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to outside of beauty shop experiences, but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> But as others have noted when it gets hot, the tube will separate from the bonnet.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> if you like a really hot dryer.  </li>
            <li> I returned this one, because it was too hot for comfort.  </li>
            <li> When my gold and hot broke</li>
            <li> put your favorite deep conditioner in damp hair (I use BioSilk Fruit Cocktail Reconstructing Treatment) and put a disposable shower cap on, followed by the dryer bonnet and let the heat do its work for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The reason I ordered the dryer was because the first one cap came apart and now this one has  stop working.  </li>
            <li> Even with a towel around my neck, it was too hot for me to handle.</li>
            <li> The medium setting was pretty hot on my ears</li>
            <li> but I just moved the bonnet from over my ears when they got to hot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully used for the purposes that I intended to use it for but, using it as a heater for my deep conditioner/color have been fabulous!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns anything.</li>
            <li> my hair with blazing hot air.</li>
            <li> Frizz free, bouncy, soft curls.</li>
            <li> when I first opened the box I saw a big SCRATCH on the top part of the storage case.</li>
            <li> Setup is pretty self explanatory, I cannot imagine what you would need instructions for.</li>
            <li> issue I have with hair bonnet is not a deal breaker, but the bonnet is really more for someone who is drying hair with rollers rather than someone simply deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I even once tied it around my head once and then under my chin to prevent the bonnet from lifting, because it does blow up like a hot air balloon, feeling as if it would like to lift up from off your head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My first dryer came scuffed up</li>
            <li> it would be too hot.</li>
            <li> It has 500 watts of power (most others have 400 but that extra 100 makes a difference in drying time) and does have 4 settings on it.</li>
            <li> It does get hot around your neck because of the air holes in the dryer but that you can put a towel around your neck.</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s back in stock.  </li>
            <li> The first dryer I ordered looked as if it had been a returned item.  </li>
            <li> I use it for deep conditioning, diffusing my wash and gos, and rod sets mostly.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> Gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting a towel around your neck to prevent it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> It gets &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; hot.  </li>
            <li> Its nice and compact when closed up.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife wanted, but found we couldn&#x27;t use it because the voltage here in Australia is 240 volt &amp;</li>
            <li> I would advise anybody buying electrical appliances from overseas to check out the voltage first, as you are not advised of this when you buy online.</li>
            <li> This dryer was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> this dyer gets HOT.</li>
            <li> After the first use it stopped working.</li>
            <li> As some reviews have stated, this dryer is extremely hot and that&#x27;s just on &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (The dryer looks exactly like the picture listed)  1 year update:  </li>
            <li> This is what broke on my Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> I ignored that, I read the directions and decided to use it in my hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the bonnet and the ability to move around unlike the traditional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Hot air leaks out the sides and burns your neck and ears.</li>
            <li> The hose gets pretty hot too, but it&#x27;s a dryer so...</li>
            <li> The Laila Ali gives me exactly what I need including comfort.</li>
            <li> Probably could have more elastic or drawstring all the way thru which might correct hence only giving 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The hot setting is not uncomfortable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> hose not insulated so it gets hot on your neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get hot.</li>
            <li> granddaughters love the present.  </li>
            <li> The vent kept blowing HOT air on my neck.</li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable, I had to sit at a perfect angle and cover my neck for it to even be bearable.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised and shortened the drying time for my waist-length locs from three days to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical to purchase this item at first</li>
            <li> Because this dryer isn&#x27;t really anything to write home about!</li>
            <li> This item does not look like what is advertised on the video review By IsaReviewer on May 7, 2013, on the first page of this item.  </li>
            <li> The hot setting is not too hot though</li>
            <li> The combo on/off switch and temperature control malfunctioned the first time I used it and is now stuck, so the unit cannot be turned off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up having to hold the hose at a funny angle to keep it from popping out of the bonnet hole if I have to sit under the dryer for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> hot and thought about buying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a while now, and its still working just like when I first received it.</li>
            <li> It also dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> Using the dryer for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that there was a middle setting, and that there was more ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : This is my first cap dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to have an even bigger bonnet to cover my 3 in rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3.The medium setting is fiery hot and burns your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it once to do a hot oil treatment on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like that the dryer gets really hot and the oil treatment penetrates my hair.</li>
            <li> Also... the lid broke off during the first use.  </li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect so many different reviews.</li>
            <li> It does get hot.</li>
            <li> The higher heat setting gets quite hot.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased 1 for myself and then I got another for my sisters.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I don&#x27;t mind sitting under a dryer.  </li>
            <li> The unit refused to turn off after the first use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Hot is HOT.</li>
            <li> bonnet in a pretty purple carrying case.</li>
            <li> my first time using it,</li>
            <li> The hose gets extremely hot with use and burns the skin.</li>
            <li> The one I seen was the first edition and not the one in this picture.</li>
            <li> Most people said that the bonnet was so big they didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem.  </li>
            <li> This bonnet does the job, gets hot</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li> It gets hot but does not overheat.</li>
            <li> The 4 heat settings are awsome and if you want to crank up the heat the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting will do you justice.</li>
            <li> The first one fell of my lettle daughter&#x27;s desk and wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying not to let this one fall because I don&#x27;t know if the first one was defective or if they are that they weren&#x27;t built sturdy.</li>
            <li> However, it gets HOT...</li>
            <li> You may need to place a towel over your shoulder because it tends to get hot (just like the hairdresser).</li>
            <li> The dryer works very well!  </li>
            <li> The connection from the hose to the hood came off after my first use.  </li>
            <li> and it does seem to get particularly hot at the hose part of the hood.  </li>
            <li> First of all everything is in the purple case.  </li>
            <li> The hot setting can get really hot after awhile.</li>
            <li> I like the big bonnet for fitting all my hair but the heat almost blows the cap off so like another reviewer</li>
            <li> No problem with it being too hot around the ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One funny note, according to the directions you cannot put this dryer on any surface.</li>
            <li> I got this to do a hot oil treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well for drying my dreads after retwisting!</li>
            <li> Used for the first time, tonight</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to do my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets to hot on the hot cycle.</li>
            <li> The sound of the motor is loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hot is TOO hot.</li>
            <li> This is however, my first use.  </li>
            <li> Which basically means that it&#x27;s blowing hot air out, but not into the hood.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot on the neck</li>
            <li> And my ears dont get hot at all</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast...love the product!</li>
            <li> They are standard and can be used on all or most bonnet dryer machine.</li>
            <li> But if you are willing to hold it it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> The power off button did not work at first</li>
            <li> Wanted to use the item first.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get something more durable and easier to use.</li>
            <li> and I have fallen asleep a couple of times during my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> It gets overly hot now and the plastic part that attaches to the bonnet cracked</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) It get hot - it that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Still this dryer is better than the others in it&#x27;s price range, I&#x27;ve bought several.</li>
            <li> The first time it worked well.  </li>
            <li> Very dissappointing!</li>
            <li> gone are the days of pin curls and curlers but this is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> The hot is BLAZING hot and you will need a towel for your neck.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hot</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I tried hot rollers and they burned my scalp.</li>
            <li> But it does get REALLY hot.</li>
            <li> I used hot and sat under it for 30mins.</li>
            <li> The tubing also gets really hot</li>
            <li> The negatives is it does tend to get really hot sometimes</li>
            <li> it gets hot but all of the heat escapes because of the oversized bonnet.</li>
            <li> It never got too hot</li>
            <li> It stays hot and is durable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li> I order the item after reading many reviews and watching a short video posted By IsaP \\&quot;Isa\\&quot; (Claremont, CA).</li>
            <li> This is my first order that had to be cancelled and still awaiting a refund.</li>
            <li> The high heat setting is super hot</li>
            <li> I never use the high setting because the medium setting is super hot already.</li>
            <li> In 2 places on the box it says there are 2 settings: but there are are actually 4: 1) High - hot (good for the first 20 minutes); 2)low hot (good for the next 10 minutes then 3)cool (a. high or b. low) for the  final finishing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ear protectors when using this dryer as my ears tend to heat up rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> It will also come off your head if it is not tight, so I tie my band around the front to secure it.</li>
            <li> The dryer hair bag is super huge and provides heat throughout my entire head / hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for when you want to deep condition your hair or you want your hair to dry faster.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 15-20 minutes to dry, which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Instead of tabs that lock into the bonnet, this unit has notches on the hose that fit into a groove on the bonnet, making for a more stable connection and less chance of breaking those tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good hair dry, and I would purchase the soft bonnet again.</li>
            <li> I saw previous  comments about the bonnet and would like to explain that this type of dryer is for someone who needs to wear curlers to really get a good style.  </li>
            <li> Gets very hot (also a con) and has very high speed, so it dries fast.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have room for it right now.</li>
            <li> I use medium heat which is very hot so never had to switch to high</li>
            <li> The high heat setting gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I think they should make the hose sturdy enough to not come apart so easily because it cannot be replaced or fixed easily.</li>
            <li> She will now be able to go into pool this year because she can now dry her hair in hours compared to days of letting them dry on their own.</li>
            <li> Other than that, truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li> I just wish the hood fit a little better.</li>
            <li> I put it on, turned the heat to medium (high is too hot), and in 40 mins, voila!</li>
            <li> The other downfall is that the hood has a screw like piece that locks into the hose but easily falls out when trying to get comfortable while drying.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my hard hat dryer, glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I really love this one because it is more mobile than a hard hood dryer.  </li>
            <li> VERY hot which is perfect for my long thick hair, very compact and portable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  If you want an inexpensive and apparently reliable hair dryer, this works fine.  </li>
            <li> Paid for itself in one skipped salon visit, plus it&#x27;s a more gentle heat (on low) than the one at the salon.</li>
            <li> But I use jumbo rollers on my whole head so this most likely wont be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li> Granted my hair was soft, but soft helmet hair isn&#x27;t any better than frizzy crunchy</li>
            <li> The blower blows so good that I have to only put it on low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First - the motor is powerful without generating a lot of extra heat&lt;br /&gt;Second - the hood is ROOMY and COMFORTABLE and accommodates the largest of rollers</li>
            <li> This thing is OK however the cord is very short - so get your snacks and supplies ready beforehand.  </li>
            <li> 4 heat and flow settings - high is too hot for me, but medium works well with just the right amount of airflow</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a pretty decent dryer with better heat than the basic Conair bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> The hose does get hot when on high so make sure you cover your back with something</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the multi heat settings and I tend to use medium and the high is simply too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li> The next lowest setting is very cool.</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews are correct.  </li>
            <li> So if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself just use the high cool setting for deep conditioning and the low cool setting for drying.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that Amazon absolutely fulfilled their &amp;#34;One Day Guaranteed&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li> Dries hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it weekly for hot oil treatments at home.</li>
            <li> I love that it has 4 heat settings and the bonnet would be big enough to fit over curlers if I chose to do so.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my friend that has long dreads and she is in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I was very concerned when I first looked at the bonnet and thought no way this would work.  </li>
            <li> Does the job but the strap isn&#x27;t very efficient because the hot air comes out and burns your neck and ear</li>
            <li> It gets hot and it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a hair dryer, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> so much spit does exactly what it says I would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Really *Recommend if anyone is considering purchasing this bonnet dryer to contact the seller first via email or phone.</li>
            <li> immediately just let it cool completely for 10-15 min</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of hair (past my shoulders) and this dryer gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Being natural is a full time job</li>
            <li> However, once you have it on and turned on, the air inside kind of holds it up from falling down around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> the adjustable soft hose comes out of the bonnet very easily and is too short.</li>
            <li> For a small machine it puts out very good heat and airflow and it runs reasonably quietly.  </li>
            <li> only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the cord was short other than that it is an excellent bonnet hairdryer</li>
            <li> This little thing packs more of a drying lunch than I thought it would!</li>
            <li> Other than that it dried my head full of curly hair quickly after my first Curlformers attempt and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this at first, but found that it really works.  </li>
            <li> I Love it and use it to dry my twist/braid out styles.</li>
            <li> Love it I can dry my hair and watch tv without straining my neck.  </li>
            <li> The hose detaches itself from the bonnet quiet easily.</li>
            <li> This really works, dries my hair fast because it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> and this is nice that it takes up less space than a standing one.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack back up and store.</li>
            <li> Came very quick without express (anyone in Hawaii will definitely understand).</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can set up shop to dry my hair where ever I choose.</li>
            <li> It all fits back into its case easily and is convenient to travel with, or carry around.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I have to get the dryer part away from my ears and put the TV on super loud - but it works.  </li>
            <li> My hair would dry quicker if the bonnet was able to keep all the heat inside.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not doing yoga while using this one, I find that I can still work on my laptop, read and generally move about with ease as the dryer offers more flexibility.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the bonnet on the pictured dryer and the model I received has the typical bonnet.</li>
            <li> It works easy and wish that the bonnet was smaller.</li>
            <li> Only setback is the hoes can come out a bit too easy</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding a similar dryer that was easy to use and portable, which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I wanted to control my curls so they would be smooth and not dry and frizzy, etc...  </li>
            <li> Everything about it is strong and sturdy and built to last.</li>
            <li> On the negative side however,some hot air does escape and bonnet at times needs to be adjusted during use, but overal a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is quite handy, small and powerful.  </li>
            <li> so I strongly suggest using it on low heat!  </li>
            <li> This is a very durable, light weight, high quality soft bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> Its compact, versatile and does the job with my medium to large roller set.</li>
            <li> It heats hotter on certain areas of my head than others.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is large.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large and is adjustable by elastic drawstring.  </li>
            <li> I bought some large velcro rollers and the Laila Ali bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> I like the settings the dryer has and the large bonnet.  </li>
            <li> If you want high heat, use the hot option with high blower and it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I love that the bonnet tube is long enough so that I can work on my computer or read comfortably while my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li> and I was comparing the 2 in order to decided which one I would purchase and I am satisfied with the Laila Ali version because of price, a little more even-ness of air flow under the bonnet, and that this bonnet stays put as with the Gold n&#x27; Hot constant</li>
            <li> my hair is extremely thick, naturally curly (with a great tendency to &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;) and shoulder lenght.  </li>
            <li> It is an attractive purple and black with Laila Ali&#x27;s name on the case in white.  </li>
            <li> I really like having it compact and easy to store and travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I enjoy being able to sit or lay down with the bonnet.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly, isn&#x27;t too loud and the bonnet is large enough to fit over large hair rollers.</li>
            <li> Anyway, drying capabilities work fine, once you adjust bonnet on head properly.</li>
            <li> She uses it to deep condition her hair and it does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> I was looking on Amazon for other options, but the reviews on the Hot Tools and the Andis dryers aren&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, is surprisingly fast to heat up &amp; made my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> The hottest and highest setting doesn&#x27;t strike me as being especially hot -- some other reviewers have found the hot setting uncomfortably hot, so it might just be my particular unit that doesn&#x27;t heat up to the level that others do.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works for me as I use it more, for it is convenient to be able to put rollers in wet hair and dry it well within an hour.  </li>
            <li> My hair ends up dry not fried ! :-)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and can&#x27;t simply style with a blowdryer and get the volume.  </li>
            <li> Main problem is that the medium setting is too hot.</li>
            <li> but it is a very HIGH quality product.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large and will fit over extra large rollers.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on drying time significantly, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice variety in settings, blows evenly, and stores everything away in little compartments.</li>
            <li> High is to hot.  </li>
            <li> Also, High DOES get really hot.</li>
            <li> I use the medium heat setting because high is too hot for me.</li>
            <li> This provides four possible combinations...low/cool, low/warm, high/cool, high/warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use large clips to secure my curls while drying.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough and comfortable.</li>
            <li> LUV that the cap is large enough to fit over my head and the purple setting rollers with room.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the only portable bonnet dryer out there that will fit over my larger-than-average (I&#x27;m a 6-footer) head, covered in large curlers.</li>
            <li> The bonet has a large size to fit my big rollers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud--but overall a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> I will normally use high first just to get the dryer warmed up then once I feel that it is getting too hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and cute and works a little better than my mom&#x27;s old old one.  </li>
            <li> Ive only used it a few times but its great - Dries evenly</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> the whole room smelled of burnt iron so i stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> Really works when conditioning.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer works really well....</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have have much slack.</li>
            <li> Then when you go to put the hose back in the case, you have to fight with it to fit in.  </li>
            <li> It heats very well and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> And the price is totally reasonable.</li>
            <li> then that I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier already since now</li>
            <li> Two day shipping was fast and on time.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very compact.</li>
            <li> Wish the hair bonnet was bigger so it can fit jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> it dries really well</li>
            <li> The heat evenly flows throughout the bonnet onto my whole head.</li>
            <li> the plus side, those 8 times I used it hair was left shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really wish it would have survived longer.</li>
            <li> It really deserves 10 stars.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair, and it&#x27;s probably very gray underneath.  </li>
            <li> Plus, treated hair isn&#x27;t very shiny anyway.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much since I haven&#x27;t been to the pool in awhile</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer; however, it requires some extra effort to make using it comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your prompt delivery</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Its lid had to be opened for it to work, so it seemed very bulky.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make to much noise.</li>
            <li> When you put the bonnet on there is a drawstring to tighten it, and it stays in place really well.</li>
            <li> Also, door to this compartment is so flimsy and cheaply made that I contemplated keeping the bonnet a separate place but ended up not doing because knowing myself will end up losing the bonnet entirely.</li>
            <li> The dryer wasn&#x27;t blowing as fast.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast, but needs a longer tube.</li>
            <li> I really, really lke this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and can be carried and set up anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I can now set my hair in rollers and sit for 30 to 45 minutes and take out the rollers and am ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a bonnet dryer for months and had only run across cheaply made ones.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for quality.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t seem as if the attachment is going to rip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d still end up really frizzy.</li>
            <li> So....I highly recommend this dryer for curly haired women who want to reduce drying time, frizz, and have bouncy hair!</li>
            <li> And it heats up fast and medium setting</li>
            <li> The heat distributes very evenly.  </li>
            <li> I really like the item and have made adjustments for keeping the bonnet on.</li>
            <li> I really like have a bonnet versus those inexpensive hood dryers (ie the ones sold at Wally World)</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li> So much easier and cheaper to sit at home rather than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really test any out, but I decided to buy this one for about $55.</li>
            <li> Thanks Laila</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Very impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I like that the unit is very self</li>
            <li> Heats up very well and drys my semi-long  hair.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and very compact.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> It heats very well and is durable.  </li>
            <li> Wd be better if it cd operate w/ lid closed.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer in 30 minutes which is fast because it use to take me about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable, efficient, and low-priced...</li>
            <li> I really wanted a dryer</li>
            <li> (Thanks to Wen).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all the rave is about with this product.</li>
            <li> Sounds like it will disintegrate before much time go by.  </li>
            <li> I can once again move my head like a real person while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well.  </li>
            <li> It does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> I really want this product, but I want the one that is being advertised everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Very storable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like cold is warm and hot is actually hot.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> Also, the unit itself is much cheaper in quality.  </li>
            <li> Really peeved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Straight out the box</li>
            <li> miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very well constructed.  </li>
            <li> and somehow it seems to make my hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Laila Ali.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the need for High-Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li> and if I really didn&#x27;t like it I could sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer</li>
            <li> I really like my drier</li>
            <li> and I really like this.</li>
            <li> I really like the design of it</li>
            <li> but once you get the fit just don&#x27;t undo it for the next use.</li>
            <li> Once you get it to stay in, you have to sit very still and don&#x27;t move otherwise</li>
            <li> BUT it really dries my hair very well...</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t feel like it was circulating air as much as I thought it should)</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient dryer.</li>
            <li> And it worked really well</li>
            <li> It is compact and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is very compact.</li>
            <li> it is much easier to store.  </li>
            <li> That said, I only gave it three stars primarily because of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too put out about that and appreciated the forewarning.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t really used it yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fits really well...without hurting.</li>
            <li> but the ratings and review seem very favorable.</li>
            <li> very portable and heats up very well.</li>
            <li> The drawback I encountered was that I feel the need to rotate the cap/hose position as the side without the hose didn&#x27;t seem to get quite as much air.  </li>
            <li> But it does get very out around the ear area.</li>
            <li> Shipped received fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dyer</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to hold the airhose to allow air flow through the whole cap.</li>
            <li> Very convenient bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hot..easy to use, not like a solid hood dryer where u have to sit under it and figure out how u can do that and still be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> However The hose doesn&#x27;t fit back in like it used to, and sometimes it will not click to off</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li> the weekend, I went to Sally&#x27;s and purchased their Modern Elements 1875W Ionic Pro Rollabout Tourmaline Dryer.  </li>
            <li> so you can fit the big rollers under it.</li>
            <li> this thing REALLY works.</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and drys hair FAST.</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars; however where the hose attaches to the bonnet, if you move too much it will disconnect.  </li>
            <li> and it drys your hair fast.</li>
            <li> really works well and folds yp like a dream</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it&#x27;s very compact, so once I was done with it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
            <li> It fits around my whole head, with ajustable strings.</li>
            <li> I like this product because its very convenient and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> We got our friends to invest in this product and we all save so much money buying using this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be adjusted to fit tighter for deep conditioning and looser for roller sets.  </li>
            <li> OK but took longer to dry than my older bonnet dryer from the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I may be comparing it to the old Conair portable I bought way back 15 or more years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this dryer for the most part since I got it for deep conditioning my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is nice and big - goes over big curlers.  </li>
            <li> I am a consistent Amazon Prime customer and shop almost weekly on here and this by far is my first 1 star review.  </li>
            <li> I saw some comments about fit problems, but if you turn it so that the air is coming at the base of your neck it works best.  </li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been nice but the bonnet just want big enough.</li>
            <li> It is more compact but the motor runs as loud as a regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to pack, relatively small, I place it right in the corner of my bed and side table.</li>
            <li> but it can get really hot on the high settings and as one other review suggested, use the medium settings and you will be ok.</li>
            <li> oh such a pretty purple!!</li>
            <li> The fan does not push much warm air to dry the top and sides of hair, so you end up with dry hair in the back and wet hair on the top and sides.  </li>
            <li> The motor is super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> The first one did not appear to be new.  </li>
            <li> The item is completely new, no marks, no discoloration or scratches compared to the first dryer I received.  </li>
            <li> tend to get too hot) new model 1 star.</li>
            <li> The heat was fine, the low setting gets the job done, we&#x27;ve tried the high setting too, and that works too.</li>
            <li> Hot is really hot, and cool is about right, but that leaves us with no cool.  </li>
            <li> But overall I am satisfied with my purchase and if I&#x27;m in a hurry and need my hair to dry quickly, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The nozzle attaches to the bonnet very easily and securely, and the bonnet itself is very thick but flexible.  </li>
            <li> It has a high and low fan setting and a hot and cool settings.  </li>
            <li> but when I first switched it on it was VERY LOUD...</li>
            <li> Its either low or high, hot or cool.</li>
            <li> however you control with two switches - High and Low, Hot and Cool.  </li>
            <li> There are 4 settings, low, high, cool and hot.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer comes with hot or cool and high or low option.</li>
            <li> It will dry your hair completely and fast and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> But i love that i can get my hair dry while on the couch watching TV, albeit very loud TV.  </li>
            <li> :) The hose connects to the bonnet a little higher up</li>
            <li> When feeling her hair under the hooded dryer while deep conditioning,  only the top of her head would be hot.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;warm\\&quot; settings were exactly the same -- incredibly hot!  </li>
            <li> Overall this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a better cap from my other bonnet dryer which I&#x27;m going to save.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The bonnet that I recieved was black, which I loved and it is large enough to accommodate rollersets, Flexi Rod sets and whatever your heart desires.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with high hopes that it would be a great replacement for my broken dryer.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old hard hat hair dryer this one is compact and can easily travel by fitting in an overnight bag or suitcase.</li>
            <li> There is Hot Low, Hot High as well as Cool Low and Cool High, which are more or less like the fan setting on an AC—it just blows air.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up and take down!</li>
            <li> I must say my long locks dried great.</li>
            <li> When I unpacked it from the box and took it out of the plastic bag, it had fingerprints all over it and the plastic was casing was swirly and scratched, like someone had tried to clean it and sent it back.</li>
            <li> Also the elastic in the bonnet is already adjusted tight enough (right out of the box) so that it has a snug comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> really heats up on high ..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and using this soft bonnet dryer has been much more gentle on my hair than using my hand-held hair dryer with a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hot,  the bonnet is large for big rollers.  </li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot but dried my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> After an hour on heat/low air, my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry back it did warm it up quite a bit...</li>
            <li> But it worked very well and my hair felt super moisturized after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse and dense natural hair, so I was impressed!</li>
            <li> of the reviews mentioned the bonnet being very large - large enough to accommodate large curlers.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of another reviewer and tied a long scarf around the parameter of the bonnet; this kept the heat contained and made it fit (</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return it now and it does not seem like there is an option to have the cap replaced or to even contact the seller directly to see if they would be willing to help in anyway.</li>
            <li> and/or the hose being way too hot near whatever part of my body</li>
            <li> There are 4 settings, cool, low, medium, and hi.</li>
            <li> the cool feature fixes that also the flexibility to turn the bonnet from back to front and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how hot it can get.</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s pretty loud.  </li>
            <li> , it s perfect.it get hot all over and its not to loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact and fits nicely in my smallest, carry-on suitcase.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet ties at the back of your neck and has 3-4 holes at the front and sides of the bonnet that I suspect are supposed to keep it cool on your head.</li>
            <li> I promise if it wasn&#x27;t a pain in the A$$ to send back, I&#x27;d ask for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer I have used it on my 8 yrs old hair for her deep conditioning treatment for her natural hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to get small tasks done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, but I have a hard time make it right enough without it blowing off my head.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it while laying down relaxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has 4 settings: cool, low, medium, and high.  </li>
            <li> My dryer has cool,  low, medium and high.</li>
            <li> They have low &amp; high as well as cool.</li>
            <li> If you use the cool option, using high gives a stronger air flow and the low option would be a lower air flow.  </li>
            <li> This dryer comes with 4 settings though, Cool, Low, Medium and High.  </li>
            <li> The dryer also has 4 settings: cool, low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li> Hair dried fast and felt full of extra body.worth the buy:)</li>
            <li> It works fine over loose unclipped/unrolled hair as well.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that sometimes the hood can fly up if you don&#x27;t make sure to wrap the strings around the front of the hood too to tie it down.  </li>
            <li> And maybe it did for about 15 minutes or so, but I live at the beach and the whole effect</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this was a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> My conditioning treatments have gone to whole new level.  </li>
            <li> I also love the purple and black color of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Mine was purple and black, my favorite colors, and the case was rounded with the built in handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hose is a decent length, maybe 24 inches?</li>
            <li> and I just love the big white cap.</li>
            <li> Luckily i have a big head and lots of hair.</li>
            <li> but I do not notice that it dries my hair any quicker than older types, without the ion tech, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Definitely gets hot enough (on the highest setting, I put a towel on my neck just in case), and dries my hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a problem keeping the bonnet on and it drys my hair within a decent time.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the sleek contemporary design of it.  </li>
            <li> Even on the low setting the heat is HOT but not too hot.</li>
            <li> I felt like the heat was hot enough and not too hot, though I did place a towel around my neck for comfort.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to use that much heat for more than a few minutes)</li>
            <li> However.. the low heat is pretty hot too</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact, quick, and for short hair, it gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> This is the older model where the air pump keeps falling out of the bonnet.</li>
            <li> The uses the dryer at least twice per month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go past the medium setting (I&#x27;m sure those with longer hair use the higher setting)  </li>
            <li> Has anyone tried this particular model?</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it does feel like its going to fly off your head at times</li>
            <li> The older model was quite and efficient.</li>
            <li> Really cannot move very far from unit.</li>
            <li> The Hose also is very hot and if draped across the body will leave red</li>
            <li> Have to switch between hot and cool settings to stay comfortable so not good for someone with impaired sensations, could burn them.</li>
            <li> Usually have to turn it to low where it is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it gets very hot even on the lower setting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and small enough that I will be able to take it when I have to travel for work.</li>
            <li> I am fairly tall at 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;, but the hose is long enough that I can set the case next to me on the chair and it reaches the bonnet easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use and the bonnet is large enough to go over big rollers and you can adjust the bonnet over your ears so they don&#x27;t burn!  </li>
            <li> The bonnet fits over extra large rollers and the entire dryer is so compact and easy to store!&lt;br /&gt;Whoever</li>
            <li> Also where they bonnet connects to the hose this fit is so loose the hose fall off the bonnet all the time.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how long it will last as I will only be using it every six to eight weeks, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and very happy that I&#x27;ve gained back a couple of hours where I can go out in public!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but it took to long to dry my hair</li>
            <li> The high is definitely high.</li>
            <li> I put the bonnet on for 15 min, on high.</li>
            <li> You will need to protect your ears and neck from the high heat.  </li>
            <li> well I put this thing on high and lord have mercy</li>
            <li> The high setting can be used for about 15 mins.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I wrapped my hair, tied the dryer on, turned it to high</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and recommends it highly for anyone who sets their hair on rollers.</li>
            <li> She recommends this dryer highly.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried it on high heat because if it does it on medium, it probably does it sooner on high).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best thing I can say about my purchase is that the hood fit over my largest size Goody rollers (the big pink ones).  </li>
            <li> It is made of high grade plastics.</li>
            <li> It was a child sized desk, so it wasn&#x27;t high but still the dryer wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> No idea how this can be so highly rated.  </li>
            <li> I run my temp on high and place cotton around my ears and neck.</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact in size and high on heat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> High heat setting not recommended.</li>
            <li> other than I would have liked a 3rd choice in heat setting (medium)....</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer has several heat settings and dried my hair more quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> My drying results are better too because my entire head is covered and sometimes the back can take longer to dry with a hooded dryer if I&#x27;m not sitting just right under it!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how large the bonnet is.</li>
            <li> It has a large bonnet that covers all of my nearly waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> Love the little case</li>
            <li> so I can move around a little, but I did expect better quality.  </li>
            <li> Cute little carrier case</li>
            <li> I love this little dryer.  </li>
            <li> Its a cute and functional little dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this little dryer.</li>
            <li> However, for setting your hair which requires a little more heat, well this dryer will give you what you want.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this purchase because I am active and wash my hair frequently and wanted to be able to style my hair....</li>
            <li> The bonnet is rather large, and as a result the heat escapes from the back of it and causes your neck to get really hot.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough for my jumbo rollers and heat really hot.</li>
            <li> It is also lightweight and easy to carry due to the built in handle.  </li>
            <li> However, Low-Hot decreases the air flow significantly making it take a lot longer to dry than drying on the medium setting of the Laila Ali dryer.  </li>
            <li> Due to the fact that the circualting air in the dryer is strong.</li>
            <li> blowing off  due to the strong air flow by tying the strings under my chin like a bonnet.  </li>
            <li> Love this dryer - dries my thick hair very fast.  </li>
            <li> A small towel wrapped around back of neck for the high setting is a good idea.  </li>
            <li> If you use low heat then switch to cool, it&#x27;ll cool down a little but wont be a true cool feel.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and as comfortable as can be expected from a soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> Pros: dries hair fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, is purple.</li>
            <li> I am natural &amp; use this to do twist outs when I don&#x27;t have much time...</li>
            <li> Have to fit the hood on the head carefully to avoid burning the neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this bonnet dryer after my Gold N Hot became damaged and generally un-useable.</li>
            <li> I can sit still and watch TV with the sound way up for that long a time - no trouble.  </li>
            <li> The various parts fit easily back into their slots and the whole dryer is compact.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s old dryer bonnet was really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and the hot and cold buttons work well.</li>
            <li> They are bulky and loud and you feel confined to one spot the whole time you are under them.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job, drying my long thick hair in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the buttons on the  bottom back get really hot so make sure to place a towel under the bonnet in the back bottom.....</li>
            <li> Overall: we&#x27;ll worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> , I get so hot after several minutes, I switch to cool for a minute or 2 then return to low heat till I finish my treatment time.</li>
            <li> My dryer has the following settings Off, Cool, Low, Medium and Hot.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer - dried my hair fast - the bonnet was big enough for my jumbo rollers - and storage is fantastic, fits on my shelf.</li>
            <li> But I learned to turn the bottom to the top of my head spreading out the heat and that dried it faster.</li>
            <li> It gets hot and drys my hair (which is short) really fast.</li>
            <li> I have used Gold N Hot dryers that have lasted for at least 5 years for more.  </li>
            <li> My normal hair dryer was not drying my dreads fully.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that makes this product worth it is the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The results look like I just left the salon (and by the way, I rarely go to the salon...</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair with a mind of its own.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is good but not great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves her hair softer, not hard.</li>
            <li> I generally use it on low or cool simply because the medium is very hot to me</li>
            <li> Everything fits compactly in the case for storage, and it is easy to place back in the case - it is not one of those that never quite go back  the way it was.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and it allows my hair to dry with a natural look, free of frizz.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly to dry braid and twists for braid outs and twists outs, deep conditioning, and when coloring my hair so that color takes in better.</li>
            <li> I will try and sit on the couch and the outlet is right next to the couch</li>
            <li> The cord was too short and had to sit right at the outlet and not move.</li>
            <li> I just received item today, inspected the box and item inside and placed it right back in the box because it isn&#x27;t what is advertised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not too big but just the right size.</li>
            <li> I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> The button too turn it too off doesn&#x27;t always position in the right spot when turning, as I had to unplug it several times to turn off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it right now actually.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is also large enough to accommodate large setting rollers for you ladies who have longer hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the hose isn&#x27;t very long; however, because the case stays relatively cool</li>
            <li> I had a head full of flexirods I needed dry in an hour before heading out for evening libations.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t fit tight and it&#x27;s very noisy plus the heat from the hose melted the cap</li>
            <li> All other bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried either doesn&#x27;t really fit my head when I am doing a roller set</li>
            <li> The heat can become a little warm on back of neck but</li>
            <li> The back of the neck may get a little warm too.</li>
            <li> (knocks on wood) but after researching and researching this, only use i read is that if you put it on HOT and High have a towel wrapped around your neck.</li>
            <li> The dryer also has cool/ hot settings as well as low&amp; high.  </li>
            <li> My only reason for not giving it a #5 is because when I put it on high, it gets too hot, and I can&#x27;t handle it.  </li>
            <li> first, I wished this dryer had a medium air flow setting instead of just high and low.</li>
            <li> However, the high heat is too hot, the motor is louder, and the slimmer case needs to stay in the same position while I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> If these were new, the plant that makes them needs to be cleaner and wear gloves.</li>
            <li> You will have to purchase a new unit :*</li>
            <li> , I had to order a new bonnet.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try out my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new hair go to.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is big enough to fit big curlers, it gets to a pretty high heat setting.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have noted, the Hot High gets really hot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bonnet dryer in March and it came with a black tie-on bonnet that would slip off easily unless you tied it super-tight.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet could be tightened and fit well for both my larger head and lots of hair, and my mother&#x27;s smaller head and shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is really big to fit different size head or styles &amp;#34;hair rollers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Low is warm enough to dry my hair</li>
            <li> The only way I figured out how to use it comfortably is to sit on the floor next to the bed with the box on the bed.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have is that the top purple cover will keep closing over the dryer, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried a few bonnets before and only ONE I actually liked...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on you hair length and thickness,  you will dry quick.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about doing your own hair at home or if you do hair on the side</li>
            <li> Bonnet is big enough to fit any style.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry super evenly...</li>
            <li> On Monday, June 3, 2013 received a call/email at night from a representative stating the item is on back order and was available sometime the beginning of next week.</li>
            <li> Now I love the results and this little dryer is a powerhouse!  </li>
            <li> I love this little device!</li>
            <li> friend told me that most of this was probably just due to a wrong connection made at the factory and everyone else here seems very pleased with their purchase of this dryer</li>
            <li> There is a DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE between high and low hot settings unlike other dryers that have 2 hot settings but are equally hot.</li>
            <li> BUT, it is VERY, VERY loud.</li>
            <li> It is very loud.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very loud.  </li>
            <li> While the heat output was high, the motor was not as loud as I</li>
            <li> Works well but very loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, but it dries my hair well</li>
            <li> This company has raised the price far too high.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair dryer that is portable as well as hot enough to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The bonnet keeps the heat inside the bonnet, is large enough for jumbo rollers and gets much hotter than my old Gold-n-Hot dryer.  </li>
            <li> put it on hot, my hair started to dry really fast.  </li>
            <li> it really does dry fast!</li>
            <li> The Cool, Low, Med, High setting are actually for the amount of heat that you want, not the pressure that you want the air to flow.</li>
            <li> and the second is the black drawstring cap is HUGE, i use the dryer for conditioning treatments so the drawstring barley closes up enough for me to feel like its securely on my head.</li>
            <li> The dryer is VERY loud and even the low temperature is too hot.</li>
            <li> If you have a small head beware, this bonnet is HUGE!</li>
            <li> Sent back strap broke first time</li>
            <li> and it actually gets hot...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets really hot back there too</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get hot, but all you got to do is adjust the control switches, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> This cap seems to be made of a heavier grade plastic than other standard brands&#x27; bonnets I have owned, so perhaps it will have greater longevity.  </li>
            <li> The set up was pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I actually first saw this product here on Amazon, but I ended up buying it at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this dryer on a long car trip, and it was definitely worth bringing it along.</li>
            <li> used someone else&#x27;s Gold n&#x27; Hot hair dryer bonnet machine-thingy that looks very similar to this</li>
            <li> For those people who said it did not get hot enough...please take a second to play with the the settings because as I am trying it is cooking my head lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Some didn&#x27;t get hot enough, some weren&#x27;t heating evenly.</li>
            <li> The first I used it for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> is hot enough</li>
            <li> Stuck in low after the first usage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unaware (it&#x27;s no longer blowing hot air into the cap and my hair is not drying).  </li>
            <li> Each setting was noticeably different than the others, not just &#x27;named&#x27; hot or medium.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Con is that it is SO loud!</li>
            <li> The outside of the box unit doesn&#x27;t get hot in the 20 or 30 minutes I&#x27;ve used it, so I&#x27;m not too worried about fire danger.</li>
            <li> However, I can use it on Hot temperature and Low air flow and get medium results.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer woke everyone up at 11:30 at night because it was so loud!</li>
            <li> heat doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a regular hood dryer!!</li>
            <li> It gets a bit too hot for me, and there is no middle ground.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for hot oil</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a hot cap dryer, this one definitely does the job.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that this hairdryer has been upgraded and perfected since some of the video reviews done earlier.</li>
            <li> In addition, the hot air shoots out around the sides and burns your ears and all around the back of your neck.</li>
            <li> And sadly, no air seemed to get to the left side of my head at all under the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one was a Conair similar to this model but was discontinued when ionic heating grew in popularity.  </li>
            <li> My last one was the Gold N&#x27; Hot.</li>
            <li> I will try it with rollers next when I try my first rollerset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What i think could be better is that the heat is not equal in the entire head, so you have to turn the bonnet in order to the heat reach the back or</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li> I should have researched first prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do and distributes heat evenly during my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot just like a regular sized dryer</li>
            <li> I put this baby on and WOW!  </li>
            <li> LOUD!</li>
            <li> I use extra large rollers, put the soft bonnet on and click on the button (you have a choice of 4 settings: high - hot/ high - cool/ low - hot/ low - cool)</li>
            <li> But if all you want is dry hair and you&#x27;re willing to sit still for 30 minutes or so, then -- why not!  </li>
            <li> was a little longer, and didn&#x27;t slide out of the bonnet so easily.</li>
            <li> My head is considerably small and the cap fits just fine  (thanks to the adjustable string).</li>
            <li> so I use the dryer to partially dry my braid or twist outs before bed to make sure my hair is completely dry when I wake up, and I can avoid frizz.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t fit over them so I&#x27;ve had to move down to medium size</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, gets hot and my very thick shoulder length hair dries quickly, probably 20-30 minutes on high.</li>
            <li> I do like the new design, as opposed to the old briefcase model.</li>
            <li> but the new one is too LOUD and don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> This new one is so loud.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love the color and case and small enough to pack away nice and neatly, and the settings definitely are high enough to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very noisy, cheaply made, no power ..and the cap is small..</li>
            <li> The hose fit into the bonnet well, just seated it in the cutouts and turned it about a half turn until I heard it click.  </li>
            <li> I was hunting for an economical bonnet dryer that I could use with conditioners to help improve my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have really LONG CURLY HAIR and it worked BETTER than I expected...</li>
            <li> I only use it either on cool or low.  </li>
            <li> biggest downside to this product, which is why I think this is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and not worth more than 3 stars is that the low setting doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I know this hot air shooting out thing is a design defect because I had a soft bonnet hair dryer back in the day</li>
            <li> I know this hot air shooting out thing is a design defect because I had a soft bonnet hair dryer back in the day</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough and its not that loud.</li>
            <li> I recently have gone natural and needed an inexpensive hair dryer for my twist outs as well as hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> There are technically 4 settings, which is enough for what I need it for:  Deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, quick sets (twists &amp; braids).</li>
            <li> This can easily be repaired with a little masking tape, but if I wanted raggedy, I could have just kept using my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality bonnet dryer to do my deep conditioning treatments with and had researched alot of other dryers that had several complaints until I finally came across this dryer!</li>
            <li> I put it on high and hot and prayed, PRAYED that it would be dry in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict...</li>
            <li> Therefore, my positive impression was short lived.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers and the hose is long enough to reach from the bedside stand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair to wear it straight!</li>
            <li> I even tried running it on cool when the dryer itself was cool, thinking it was the stored heat in the tube and cap that was heating it up, but no... turn on a cold dryer to cool</li>
            <li> What other customers say about the heat on your neck and ears is true.</li>
            <li> It has a very large bonnet that can easily accommodate a wet set of long hair on big rollers.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out by using too much heat.</li>
            <li> The bonnet&#x27;s opening was too tight to fit over my hair without messing it up.</li>
            <li> I have long locs, which usually take a while to dry, but this dryer gets them done in about an hour/1.5 hrs, which is really great for the amount of hair that I have.</li>
            <li> No more sitting at the kitchen table under one of those super hot old school hair dryers.    </li>
            <li> It dried my natural hair super fast.</li>
            <li> like that it has a cool setting to help cool down my hair which is critical when deep conditioning so you don&#x27;t wash away all the natural and added oils and conditioning treatment</li>
            <li> The dryer has a 2 year limited warranty which should apply, but I only paid $30 for the dryer and by the time I pay postage to send the dryer back plus  add $15 more for return shipping</li>
            <li> Large enough to go over a roller set without struggle.</li>
            <li> It also has an extra large cap that fits roller sets.  </li>
            <li> bonnet is large enough for all my rollers (17 in all, 8 of them are lg, 4 med, 5</li>
            <li> The bonnet was certainly large enough to wear with rollers.  </li>
            <li> I needed a large bonnet to deep condition my hair</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large if you use big rollers.</li>
            <li> So the cap and cord and hose have little compartments that they fit</li>
            <li> It took too long and my only other option was to use a blow dryer which was not as effective.</li>
            <li> With the standard hooded dryer so much of the hot air gets out but with this soft bonnet dryer no air escaped and got my hair dry faster than normal.</li>
            <li> Would get an additional star if it had a medium setting, low is too low, and hi is really hot!</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted the hard top</li>
            <li> I was deciding between this bonnet dryer and the hard top dryers.</li>
            <li> I find I can easily sit it next to the couch and continue doing other things.</li>
            <li> So it may take longer to dry my hair, but because I&#x27;m able to still do other things</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain so much about the loudness though because of the regular blow dryer handheld is loud as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, so clearly I&#x27;ve had the dryer for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Gave two stars because she still uses the hat with her old dryer.</li>
            <li> It is too loud</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Wow, where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have waist length, naturally curly, takes-forever-to-dry hair.</li>
            <li> so far, I have had it for 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a bonnet dryer but do find it easier than the old hood dryer I had.</li>
            <li> I am a natural and needed a upright hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Laila Ali Soft Bonnet Dryer after reading some reviews, and viewing a video.  </li>
            <li> It only really dries one side of my hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I probably just never give any product top stars,  but I have nothing negative to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long extensions</li>
            <li> This  is what I need for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t not stress how loud and it is loud on every setting.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 85 yr old mother.  </li>
            <li> far as the mechanics of it, it does blow air well and does heat up for use.  </li>
            <li> When I want the natural look I scrunch my curls with curly hair product and let it have its way.  </li>
            <li> Nearly pulled off all of my rollers just trying to get it on.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 9 year old and</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the cutest soft bonnet dryers i have seen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money and get something with a company that offers guarantee</li>
            <li> The bonnet kept flying off of my head each time I turned the dryer on and the strings to adjust the tightness of the bonnet left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud, but no louder than you&#x27;d expect a hair dryer to</li>
            <li> It is loud to the person wearing it.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m completely blown away at how my hair felt after just 15 mins of use.</li>
            <li> Especially since I have very processed hair.</li>
            <li> Not too loud either.</li>
            <li> Old style but goodie.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I often wear natural hair weaves too.  </li>
            <li> My mom was lamenting that a hair dryer just didn&#x27;t set her hair like her old bonnet hair dryer did.  </li>
            <li> I like this dryer, it is not as loud as others that I have owned</li>
            <li> My hair dries in 20 minutes and comes out soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, so if you don&#x27;t like noise don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> it makes my home deep conditioning treatments so much easier.</li>
            <li> My mother got this for my grandmother and as far as we know my grandmother uses it instead of a handheld dryer every time she puts curlers in.</li>
            <li> It was loud and noisy, gave it to Goodwill.  </li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I use this to set my twist styles.</li>
            <li> : my hair is so soft and curly when used with rollers.</li>
            <li> IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LOUD.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m old fashioned</li>
            <li> The bonnet is big enough to fit over big curlers.</li>
            <li> I was completely expecting damp sections but found none.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you are in the UK.</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble hearing the audio.</li>
            <li> It works &amp; feels just like a professional salon hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient that I can sit under the dryer and sit in the bed, read, watch YouTube or even my nails without having to have a big hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I got my dryer more than 10 days late.</li>
            <li> (my hair is natural</li>
            <li> I tightened and tied the strings attached the to bonnect and had no trouble with it coming off.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is extremely loud</li>
            <li> I LUV the convenience and portability of a soft  bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> So far, this product has worked for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer after being natural for two years.</li>
            <li> : kinda too loud for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember how I did, but it was at some point near the end of what seemed a futile search for a bonnet dryer that was sturdy (e.g., hose doesn&#x27;t fall apart after 1-2 uses) and performed well.</li>
            <li> The heat from the dryer cap can also be too much for my skin at my nape when I leave the hose connected at the back.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My other cons are that the hose gets very hot</li>
            <li> Unlike the old dryer, this dryer&#x27;s bonnet is elasticized and has a toggle tightener.  </li>
            <li> The air strength of this bonnet dryer is MUCH LOWER than the earlier model.  </li>
            <li> If this bonnet had a soft (maybe terrycloth?)</li>
            <li> Not overbearingly loud.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom because ever since she watched a soft bonnet dryer on Tv</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo6W33EIYVSQ0G]]A comprehensive review of the Laila Ali Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer and demonstration.</li>
            <li> There was one reviewer who said that when she put the bonnet on it completely disrupted her rollers.</li>
            <li> big problem with this dryer is that the whole perimeter of the bonnet does not cinch (see video),</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color  - I am a purple fanatic.</li>
            <li> I went natural and needed to get a hood dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very compact, stands upright easily on a firm surface, and the cord storage cover is able to be closed during use allowing for convenient use and storage.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is able to be mounted to a wall and doing so would remove this negative factor.  </li>
            <li> and I find it easier to replace the dryer than to try and get the hose fixed.</li>
            <li> When I took the shower cap off, my hair was so soft and wavy.</li>
            <li> Unbearably loud.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4C African-descent hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud and it&#x27;s compact.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for my mom  in December 2013 because  after her eye surgery she had issues with the regular dryer which exposed her eyes to too much heat.</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> It would be much better if the hose were at least 1 foot longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have trouble keeping the bonnet secure on my head.  </li>
            <li> A healthier method to using direct heat.  </li>
            <li> I must say that the reviews on  how to use the different heat and speed settings were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the bonnet does continue to cover your head/hair and doesn&#x27;t slip up while drying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to replace an old collapsable hood dryer that was no longer working for me in regards to space.  </li>
            <li> (my old one lasted for about 10-so fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> It is loud, but does the job on my locks.  </li>
            <li> I use my soft bonnet dryer for hair treatments and for roller sets.  </li>
            <li> So far I used this on myself and 2 friends.</li>
            <li> Our hair feels soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews of this one and surprised her with it.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have a bonnet dryer from the 60&#x27;s; it makes my hair so soft, but it smells like old plastic.</li>
            <li> I needed something since my hooded dryer just completely died on me.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that if you are a natural you need this.</li>
            <li> I had never used a soft bonnet dryer before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I really wish the bonnet was litttle bigger.</li>
            <li> After almost fifteen years with natural hair</li>
            <li> Def not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This dryer is hotter than my old bonnet dryer, even on the medium setting, so the drying time is faster.</li>
            <li> I just got my soft bonnet dryer today.</li>
            <li> Its not too loud</li>
            <li> The noise is level is not too loud from my experience</li>
            <li> and the hose is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> So much easier to deep condition (DC)</li>
            <li> I needed a bonnet dryer for my 88 year old mother.</li>
            <li> The motor is not overly loud, but I did have to turn the units</li>
            <li> I really like it and will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> but so far is works like a champ</li>
            <li> Seems like a design flaw that could have been easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I USED IT FOR MYSELF &amp; MY 12 YR OLD.</li>
            <li> and I find that it dries evenly and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> is also loud on all heat settings so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I miss my old G.E. bonnet hair dryer that is no longer made.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed to replace my old overhead dryer for the longest.  </li>
            <li> After I was able to cover my head, it only partially dried my hair and then it was time to take off the bonnet and reposition.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time in de ember and was blown away about how hot the dryer got and how quickly it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I will revisit with update on this after few more uses because last night I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off after having it running for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it seems well made and worth the $40 I spent.</li>
            <li> I had done my research before buying it and thought that it would be a good purchase,  but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that during the rare times I use the High air flow setting (because on Hot, it gets VERY hot</li>
            <li> I could turn it down to the lowest selection and cool my hair off.</li>
            <li> It gets my whole head dry &amp; it seems to be really hot in the back of my head.</li>
            <li> When I use the high setting, the bonnet does shift from the air pressure, but will stay in place if I actually tie the strings instead of just pulling them tight - or if I just lightly hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started out with the hottest selection to dry and then turned it down to the middle selection as the hottest selection became too warm.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using it and although it does what it is suppose to, it is either really hot or not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have a small full service salon studio and my clients prefer this over the hooded dryer!  </li>
            <li> The beauty of it was that with the smallness of the bonnet (which had small holes here and there) the heat was easily adjustable by loosening the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s so small, it stores easily.</li>
            <li> I checked three of my rollers after the hot cycle and my hair was 97% dry.  </li>
            <li> but I usually just double tie around the whole head and then its fine.</li>
            <li> low is more slow and steady.</li>
            <li> Thankfully at least the high setting works, and it&#x27;s not too hot when the temp is set to hot.</li>
            <li> Lol idk why people are making this device to difficult!</li>
            <li> My only minor &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I did find it louder than I expected, but by no means louder than many hooded dryers.</li>
            <li> Since I have a lot of hair, I use the higher setting so that my hair will dry faster, but when it gets too hot, I switch to the low setting for a brief time.  </li>
            <li> My main use for this dryer is deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it once or twice a month for a deep conditioning treatment but when it stops working I will be going back to Sally&#x27;s and purchasing another Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> Plenty hot enough for the deep conditioning that I bought it for.</li>
            <li> However I can only use it on the low heat setting without feeling like my scalp is getting way too hot.</li>
            <li> only downfall is that the bonnet is a bit big have to tie a scarf around the edges to keep the hot air from blowing out and burning my neck or ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has various settings but it was too hot where the hose actually attaches to the bonnet.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a decent product.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is kind of awkward at first.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but get hot enough w/o burning my ears.</li>
            <li> With the older model I could sit close to the television and hear it when using the dryer on low speed.</li>
            <li> and I only had it on medium and those hose was hot and not log enough.  </li>
            <li> It does dry well, but it gets very hot on the high setting, and there are only high and low, and no moderate setting.</li>
            <li> It gets nice and hot and definitely cuts down the drying time on my thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large and is adjustable by what looks like a long shoe string for sneakers.  </li>
            <li> for locks start on high them as time progresses put it on low heat as it dries well but takes time especially if ur locs are 3 yrs and older and if they are denser.</li>
            <li> I love that it will dry my hair without the same level of damage you&#x27;d get from a drying tool such as a flat or curling iron, or one of those drying/styling brushes.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much volume, no frizz, and it really cuts down on my drying time.</li>
            <li> I am glad that Amazon has a great return policy but very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t actually get to use the product.</li>
            <li> The cool setting is a little warmer than I&#x27;d like, but still cooler than hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i previously had a tourmaline hard bonnet dryer that I paid $150 and loved, had it for  about 4 years</li>
            <li> It has elastic all around the opening, is fuller, and the material is not as stiff as the original.</li>
            <li> It takes me back to junior high.  </li>
            <li> The dryer has 3 setting low, medium, high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Xmas gift and the button to turn it on low or high doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The switch doesn&#x27;t allow you to click from low to high.</li>
            <li> There are 3 heat setting, low, medium and high.</li>
            <li> If I put it up high like I did my last dryer</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that I can&#x27;t use it on high because it pops off my head.</li>
            <li> and I use it with my big rollers on the high setting.</li>
            <li> The settting for this dryer is LOW and HIGH.  </li>
            <li> It may take longer, but you could definitely burn yourself with the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> I was careful to be aware that it may get too hot and possibly shut off (some reviews about products similar to this one had that problem)</li>
            <li> I am happy with my dryer it takes less time to dry my hair no more two hours.</li>
            <li> It is not extremely loud, because I can watch TV while I&#x27;m drying my hair without having to turn up the volume to 50, and I can also hear my telephone ringing without having the phone right next to me.  </li>
            <li> actual unit is small, easy on the eyes, and hosts very convenient packing spaces for the cord, bonnet, and actual connection.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very loud, much louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> She needed light weight and small.</li>
            <li> I have decided to go natural recently and this hair dryer works very well for deep conditioning and roller setting.  </li>
            <li> Second, the hood adjusts from the back (which I like) and is comfortable but be careful not to entangle your hair in the strings because it will pull it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure it its a defect in manufacturers product or cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is pretty lightweight, though, so be careful where you place it when using it.  </li>
            <li> Ladies,  it does get hot so be careful,  cover you neck.  </li>
            <li> a little too hot when it&#x27;s on high</li>
            <li> I use it under large rollers and, in fifteen minutes my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I use large curlers and my hair is  always dry in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, the tube/cord gets super hot and that&#x27;s really not a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> If it breaks down in a two years or so, I still I would have got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, however, the bonnet is so large, I have to hold it the entire time I&#x27;m drying my hair and that is a real big inconvenience for me.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough for my big head and two inch rollers.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough for my big rollers.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough for a big roller set</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s big enough for lots of large rollers), so it still gets 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I used it on me and my daugter and it definelty gets hot enough to dry our natural roller styles.  </li>
            <li> It works well but not exactly looking like something that will be around for very long with the cheap construction</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the heat may not be sufficient as I have very thick, curly, African-american hair that I wear natural most days.  </li>
            <li> Although they take up more room, I&#x27;ll probably go with a hard shell next time.</li>
            <li> Will get it next week, hopes the new one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I got the new dryer about a month later</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> The bonner covered my entire head full of large, hard rollers.</li>
            <li> Cons: too much movement causes the hose to disconnect from the bonnet and the extension cord isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> However, on the negative side, the bonnet tends to easily detach from the hose while using it.  </li>
            <li> For me that is a fast dry.  </li>
            <li> Then the day came I needed to dry my hair pronto AND do my nails to be ready for an event.  </li>
            <li> It takes close to 2 hours for my hair to completely dry, but again it truly depends on the length of your hair (and how much patience you have...)</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and like to partially dry it in a bonnet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
            <li> But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it Drys your hair fast but once u take your head out the dryer it seems as if it&#x27;s not as dry as u thought.</li>
            <li> Now I can dry my hair in 15 while I put on my makeup and be ready to go.</li>
            <li> even though it worked well the first time, the second time i tried to use it strange sounds and smell came out.  </li>
            <li> sure what&#x27;s the policy is with returns, but am going to return it once there&#x27;s no restocking fee:(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad because I really lone the color of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> I expect this unit will last some time, hopefully as long as my Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how much longer that&#x27;ll last and will call Helen of Troy next week to see about a replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer can be a bit loud, but not as loud (I don&#x27;t think) as a standard hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My mother wants me to get her one too, so I will be purchasing a 3rd sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with really corse hair.</li>
            <li> Which is very comparable to my last visit to my local salon.  </li>
            <li> on my recently colored hair - my hair (thick and shoulder length) and scalp never looked (or felt) better.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is large enough to accommodate a head full of rollers - some people complained about having to pull the ties around the edge of your face.</li>
            <li> the power level really heats up if it on high  or low switch it blow med-warm air and cool is cold if  place on hi switch and if on low it blow cool air</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the motor is very loud.</li>
            <li> it was still super hot til I put it down to low long story short ladies !</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair in less time, because it gets very hot on the high temp.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviews this dryer gets hot.</li>
            <li> If only it wasn&#x27;t so loud!</li>
            <li> Love the hot and cold settings as well as high and low also.  </li>
            <li> It is hot but does not blow enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li> It gets way too hot  on the back of your head where the air comes in and doesn&#x27;t give an even dry when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> but it is hot enough to dry the hair within 30 minutes (</li>
            <li> I love this dryer,  the only down side is the wholes disconnects if you move around to much so be careful.  </li>
            <li> So next time I&#x27;ll probably just cut the time in half and use the cool setting for the remainder</li>
            <li> You have to think about where to set it up, but once you have got your spot ( with a table nearby to hold the motor near to your head ( the hose is not very long)</li>
            <li> Well, any bonnet would disrupt your rollers if you don&#x27;t secure the rollers by tying them down with one of those large black triangle net things.</li>
            <li> I always wait a few extra minutes just to make sure my hair totally dry.</li>
            <li> Bonnet fits snugly, a wet set on medium and large rollers dries thoroughly within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found that by sticking a very thin pick, think the tooth of a comb size, mine is actually a plastic spear used to stir drinks or spear olives onto, so thin it fits perfectly into the slot to lock the hole that the lock cap wants to fall out of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What turned me off was the bonnet: it seemed too big for my main purposes of usage (as a deep conditioner heat tool).</li>
            <li> When I turned it back on it only would work on the high heat setting</li>
            <li> only con...is that; when its on high the heat emanates... from the back &amp; scorches your neck a bit</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head when I use the really big jumbo rollers so I will have to use the regular large ones</li>
            <li> The drawstrings tie the bonnet very tightly, and they are very long, so someone with a smaller head than mine might be able to loop the strings around and tie it around the top to make sure it holds in place if they are unsure that the bonnet will hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet can be slightly awkward to put on if you have very long hair and are drying it loose.  </li>
            <li> whenever I do a twist-out and it cuts down on the dry time significantly.</li>
            <li> and I could never really get comfortable because I had to have it on a flat surface which really limited my options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best, but it is far, far from the worst.</li>
            <li> I generally use the low/cool setting.</li>
            <li> is a bit clumsy yet fit well.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really like how close the holes are to your actual hair so there could be potential heat damage because the hot air is directly going on your strands, but you could always put a plastic cap as a small buffer I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However it is clearly made for bigger hair/rollers.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to completely secure it for small heads or short cuts like mine.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like , I find that the dryer is to loud for my comfort.</li>
            <li> What I DIDN&#x27;T like is that Amazon apparently is selling two versions of this.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> The cap barely fits  tied at its tightest and it still comes off as soon as you turn on the dryer.  </li>
            <li> even since months later the plastic ring that goes in the cap is completely detach so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white Czech girl with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> I looked at several soft bonnet dryers before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li> no regrets</li>
            <li> As of today it is barely blowing anything out and the nozzle will no longer stay attached to the hood.</li>
            <li> You get enough slack to move around a bit and not too loud.</li>
            <li> My last one still works, it&#x27;s just so old (10+ years)  and beat up</li>
            <li> My only cons are that it&#x27;s LOUD, so I couldn&#x27;t watch TV while using it; therefore, I turned to my trusty Kindle Voyage to get some reading done instead.</li>
            <li> Have used once a week for the last month and my hair is so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It functions just as I had expected and the portable case is very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works very well, just how I expected.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer once so far for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> The cord is a decent length, but I usually dry my hair in my bed</li>
            <li> but, no regrets.</li>
            <li> This dryer is affordable and so far I have only been using it to steam my hair or for conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> My daughter complained that it was extremely hot in the back where the nozzle enters the bonnet and the front and sides were not as hot.  </li>
            <li> I had to stay perfectly still, and I hated it.</li>
            <li> I usually use the cool setting, I wish it had a medium setting (perhaps the newer model does?)</li>
            <li> She had a stroke and is unable to do her own hair</li>
            <li> Gets hot really fast so have a thick towel around your neck just in case.</li>
            <li> I usually keep my setting in Hot Low and then blast it to Hot High for the last 2-5 minutes to ensure that my set is dry.</li>
            <li> Upon the first time using the dryer it only worked for about 45 seconds, then it shut down completely.</li>
            <li> I used high setting for about 40 minutes and hair was almost dry.  </li>
            <li> I was using it today to dry my hair on high.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is really high quality and works well to dry my flexirod sets and braid outs.</li>
            <li> The purple case was smudged especially around switches, and overall, it just didn&#x27;t look new.  </li>
            <li> It has to be held, right at the connection, which is frustrating because it gets hot.</li>
            <li> , moved to her wheel chair instead of having to get her to a certain height for other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair at a fast pace and wondeful for my 20-30 min deep conditioning treatments..</li>
            <li> when I diffuse my wash and gos, not only does it dry faster, my curls look really shiny</li>
            <li> My hair was really conditioned, but it left my scalp extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it has 3 temperature settings and the bonnet and hose can be stored right in the unit itself, so no problems with losing or missing parts.</li>
            <li> Plus this dryer takes up less space and is a pretty purple color.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry in normal time.</li>
            <li> It normally takes about an 45 minutes to dry thoroughly even in the salon.</li>
            <li> So yes; I&#x27;d recommend, but be aware of those slight drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Previous store purchased dryer came apart where the hose couples into the hood the first time I used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done in less than 15 minutes and my hair consistently looks great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was so excited to get this cute bonnet hair dryer and to support Laila Ali, but I have to say I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bonnet was nice and big, it dried my hair in very little time and it is hotttttt.</li>
            <li> Although nice and compact, she had a very difficult time getting the hose in and out of the main box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it works really well.</li>
            <li> so, I really cannot compare this dryer to any other dryer.</li>
            <li> the other side.&lt;br /&gt;The heat is appropiated and its very quick.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the hood is very roomy</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that I could use while comfortably seated on my couch (as opposed to being perched upright in a hard chair while using my traditional hard-hood dryer).  </li>
            <li> Had a hard time opening it because I expected the latch to be at the top of the case (</li>
            <li> It is so nice to slow down enough to relax under the dryer</li>
            <li> The bonnet stays in place just by pulling the strings tight and it does not get too hot.</li>
            <li> Even though I tie the Bonnet tight, when the high/hot setting is on, hot air escapes onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be more careful, with my clumsy self.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s on low, it doesn&#x27;t really dry the very front and very back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was so hot in places that I could not use it long enough to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I did not move around much, and can see where using it while active might cause the hose to disengage itself.</li>
            <li> I can stuff it back in far enough to use the dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moderately loud and definitely has the potential to burn your ears and/or neck-</li>
            <li> One thing I wish was different is the coil(connection) gets so warm and uncomfortable, may be they can improve on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently looking to change this hair dryer primarily because after close to two hours (granted I have thick hair)</li>
            <li> The bonnet stretches wide enough for a head full of rollers and the pull string is long enough to double wrap and tie around my head for bonnet security.  </li>
            <li> my hair was not dry..</li>
            <li> I may be jumping the gun slightly by offering up a review after only three uses of the product (maybe I should wait and see how the dryer holds up after a few months or a year), but I was so pleased with the results I thought I&#x27;d give one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sad to say that this bonnet completely flattens my hair on top while I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
            <li> cause when you turn it on high it will blow the bonnet back a little if u put it on high.</li>
            <li> I usually just make sure that I push it away from my neck area as I settle down.   </li>
            <li> Gets a little hot though</li>
            <li> /&gt;The positioning of the holes can get a little hot after a while if you use the hot setting, but nothing a little adjusting can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It did get a little hot</li>
            <li> This dryer is only useable at the lowest setting every other setting is simply too hot.</li>
            <li> carrying case gets a little hot.</li>
            <li> /low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty little purple casing.  </li>
            <li> Would not order another with such a large bonnet, as I have short hair, and only roll the top part in the small to medium small  rollers.  </li>
            <li> Not much difference between medium and high.</li>
            <li> But dried my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> I wrapped the string around twice and tied it in a bow but would still find the bonnet slipping off when I had the flow setting on High.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful because on high</li>
            <li> I was able to do a late routine, deep condition, style and still wake up with dry hair - hallelujah!  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is very large, and black, with thin straps that can be used to secure it if need be.</li>
            <li> teh noise is loud but tolerable due to teh fast dry time.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair (and braids under my sew in) super dry in a little over an hour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the length of the average laptop but so much lighter.</li>
            <li> To me, the low is too low and medium is not hot enough and hot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use smaller curlers because I&#x27;m not really looking for curl so much as volume, and smaller ones</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> As far as durability for the long haul... we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic smell that you get during use the first few times, it does go away.</li>
            <li> On my first use I swore it couldn&#x27;t have dried my hair in the time my blower gets the job done</li>
            <li> I have to sit it right next to me to have it reach to my head with a little bit of slack left over.</li>
            <li> The hose is a little short, had to turn bonnet sideways so it would reach even though the hairdryer was on the table right next to me.  </li>
            <li> elastic so when I attempted to pull it over my large rollers, half of them popped out, fell out of the clips or just collapsed to the floor</li>
            <li> So I can watch tv or anything really while having it on the bed without fearing it&#x27;ll burn the house down.</li>
            <li> A lot more mobile than the hard plastic type!!</li>
            <li> I like it for its small convenient size, but I wish it had a little more heating power</li>
            <li> I used to go to the salon every other week to have my hair done in either straight or curly hairstyles, but I have had to decrease my visits immensely because of financial reasons.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints are that the hose unlocks from the bonnet time to time which can be annoying and the hose gets extremely hot (duh)/ The cool setting is very cool if you use it prior to any other setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, and the shocking purple is so pretty and attractive.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t ever dry my hair completely even when I spend 1.5 hrs under this thing.</li>
            <li> I got this to dry my naturally curly hair without a hair drier.</li>
            <li> I use it to dry my hair woth my curlformers on and it fits them on completely.  </li>
            <li> Previous reviews on this product really helped my choice.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is huge which I&#x27;d prefer since I have thick, long hair (almost at my waist) and I&#x27;ll need to use XL rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much prefer that since it&#x27;s less bulky and clutsy.  </li>
            <li> I have long blonde naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a few extra dollars and get a real hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Did not dry the front of my hair like it did the back.  </li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars is that the product is not solidly made although on first few uses it works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a year ago and it dries my really thick hair quickly (about 20 to 30 mins)</li>
            <li> My hair is long, so I like to use large velcro curlers (the giant, pink Conair ones).</li>
            <li> My only concern is that down the road the bonnet strap will snap because I have to tighten it very close to my head.  </li>
            <li> , I really have to pull the bonnet down low</li>
            <li> Even if I needed to reach for something nearby or turn my head to look at someone it would completely mess the whole thing up.</li>
            <li> The tube is not long enough to support it staying on the cap.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is the hose and cord are not long</li>
            <li> The hose is not long enough to have the cap on correctly.</li>
            <li> Last night I opened the bonnet up and put it on my head without curlers, but today, with the large curlers I use, I found that the bonnet is quite tight on the sides of my head and is pressing the curlers into my scalp.</li>
            <li> It only takes me 50 minutes to dry my hair in rollers, which is almost 20 minutes quicker than when I get my hair done at the salon and so far I have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and moderately curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY hard for me to have frizz free hair.</li>
            <li> The Laila is lightweight and easier for me to move to various areas in the house -- my previous dryer was cumbersome and heavier and hard for me to carry from place to place and took up a lot more room to store.  </li>
            <li> This thing takes FOREVER to dry my hair, no less than three hours.  </li>
            <li> I have caucasian, fine, a little longer than shoulder length, straight, hard to curl hair, and I like doing retro style wet sets.  </li>
            <li> Remove cap, shake my hair out, open the cap completely and lay it over my head on low heat for another 15 minutes to dry the roots in the middle of my head under all my hair.</li>
            <li> the only thing I hate is that the air tunnel isn&#x27;t really long other than that this is the Best!!</li>
            <li> I really purchased this dryer for my 9 year old daughter that had such a hard time sitting under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had discovered later that the high cool setting is basically the same as the low heat setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen video reviews of the previous version with the black hose and hood and think that would have worked better with my hair as it does not sit as tight as this one does.  </li>
            <li> I realized quickly that after just a few minutes of use on Medium setting, that the cap was poofed and bent down on my mother&#x27;s neck and left red burn marks across her entire exposed neck.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to still use this by putting thin wash cloths across my mothers ears and draping a towel over both ears and along the entire area of her neck and down her back (double layered), and it prevented any further problem.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like the vacuum at a car wash.</li>
            <li> As my hair continues to grow I am noticing that this dryer is just not powerful enough to dry my hair in a timely fashion, mainly because it is only 500 watts.</li>
            <li> In all, it took about 40 minutes to dry my hair completely, whereas before, it took about 5 hours to air dry it while wearing the rollers.</li>
            <li> back inside.(the material is very thin, and if your not very careful you can easily break it).</li>
            <li> I have not found the dryer to be any noisier than other soft bonnet dryers I have owned over the years.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet stays put while I  sit in a chair or on the floor and complete other tasks...</li>
            <li> It is fairly loud, but no louder than any other hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Bonnet does not close tightly enough for flat drying, IMO.</li>
            <li> I actually have the black and purple bonnet dryer, the one that has a bonnet that looks like a very large, black shower cap.</li>
            <li> Yes you&#x27;ll feel a little heat on your neck at high setting</li>
            <li> It is hard to stay on the head if you&#x27;re doing something w/o rollers like deep conditioning because it looks like a hot air balloon in take off mode.</li>
            <li> She complained about the back of her neck and ears getting too hot.</li>
            <li> However, the air doesn&#x27;t really come out cold when on the cool setting.</li>
            <li> The only negative the cord can get hot on your neck but if u put a towel over your shoulders it would be no problem.</li>
            <li> :  The only complaint is, which i expect because its using heat, is that it gets hot around the neck area.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that falls to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I would say the ONLY downside to this product is that the long part that connects to the head piece from the machine is too short, but</li>
            <li> The cap may be a bit small for large curlers.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length locs, very thick hair, and the dryer was able to finish the job in less than an hour on the medium setting.</li>
            <li> and I have to put a towel or something heavy to keep the bonnet from coming off my head on high.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is poor, very cheap plastic, loud motor, and drying time is slow.  </li>
            <li> I did like the fact that when bonnet and hose are put in the unit,&lt;br /&gt;it really takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a second one so that my two daughters could get their hair dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> For people like me who just want to deep condition or dry hair without rollers, this bonnet is way too big.</li>
            <li> I was scared this bonnet wouldn&#x27;t be big enough or wouldn&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and was looking for a bonnet hair dryer that would dry my wet sets and twists.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Its for a person with really long hair or a big head person with jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> It is only 29 inches long.  </li>
            <li> idk how long this greatness will last....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given myself a deep conditioner with heat in so long, so i decided to order this.  </li>
            <li> how long it will last</li>
            <li> it on flat surfaces&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice that toward the center of nape so hair remains damp, but not &#x27;wet&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to layoff off my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> However, I wanted to find a way to do it without the flat iron all the time.  </li>
            <li> Seems like this will last mea long time</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s not going to last long.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting the cool setting to be &#x27;freeze dried&#x27; then I&#x27;m not sure what you would actually purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I have pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> I need that to cool the rollers off and set the curl, but alas, not from this device.  </li>
            <li> I have to first say I have thick hair...</li>
            <li> After the 3rd use, the hose to the bonnet broke loose from up inside the dryer and now it&#x27;s totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The area where the hose attaches to the bonnet became so loose that it no long connects.</li>
            <li> Also, extension cord not very long- limited travel distance while using product.</li>
            <li> I generally let my hair air dry, however, on days I need to dry my style I can sit under this bonnet for about 30-45 mins.  </li>
            <li> I used to let my hair air-dry, and the natural drying process could take days before I could take the set down if the weather was inhospitable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased to cut down on drying my natural hair and time</li>
            <li> I have not roller set  hair in over a year because my old bonnet dryer broke due to storage issues!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a little loud, which means I can&#x27;t watch TV unless it&#x27;s on 100 volume and with subtitles, but that&#x27;s par for the course with a hood dryer.</li>
            <li> Again it dried my hair well, but I wanted to try the black one as I had a similar Gold&#x27;N&#x27;Hot one and wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed to find the supplier (Amazon site) provide an item to a international location without so much of a mention that the unit was only fit for use in the USA (110 volts).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable and works very well, although I was leery due to some of the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length (to about underarm)  color-treated hair but with no relaxer (some refer to this as natural black hair).</li>
            <li> Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer, Purple and Black today(3/22/14)</li>
            <li> it could get hotter and would dry the entire head in one direction.  </li>
            <li> so I switch back and forth until my hair is dry.....</li>
            <li> Now I see that they&#x27;ve completely revamped the product, which annoys me, because the dryer itself is great, but the bonnet is AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> Now, when I wash and braid or twist my hair and pop on the dryer, my hair is dry after only 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to deep condition and/or dry your hair</li>
            <li> I can watch tv and make dry my hair without having to be stuck in one specific position.  </li>
            <li> I use it every week or week and a half and my hair is conditioned well and soft.</li>
            <li> After an hour and a half with the Conair dryer, my hair was still considerably wetter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t take up nearly as much space as a the commonly used hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This dryer leaves my hair feeling soft and slightly damp.</li>
            <li> I never use a dryer to dry my hair all the way; I use just enough heat to take the damp off</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in no time even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Now I just wash, towel dry, add product, and sit back with a cup of coffee and a book.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and use the medium setting and it takes no time to dry.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it&#x27;s dry in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> The bonnet (white) was not as big as I expected based on description.  </li>
            <li> I love the hot and cold settings but the bonnet is hard  to stay on.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is not large enough for jumbo rollers and it doe not allow for any movement at all, I had to keep my head tilted toward the unit the entire time.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I will mirror saying as did other reviewers - make certain you wrap either some cotton coil or a thin scarf around the nape of neck and ears when using the HIGH heat setting.  </li>
            <li> Bonnet was a little tight the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think is gonna give enough heat to dry this long hair</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t that long so it only takes 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that if you have relatively long hair, it can take 1 1/2- 2 hours to completely dry.</li>
            <li> , the bonnet distributes the heat very evenly and it&#x27;s cut down my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> As other commenters have stated, the bonnet is pretty big, but I just tied it very tight around my head to prevent it from slipping.</li>
            <li> For me the plastic bonnet would have been fine, For&lt;br /&gt;her, though, it was uncomfortable and the gathered plastic hurt her forehead.</li>
            <li> but only due to the size of the hat to accommodate larger size curlers etc.  </li>
            <li> Checked the outlet with other appliances to make sure there was nothing wrong with the outlet but got nothing from the dryer.</li>
            <li> The low cycle is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a little loud..</li>
            <li> Is a little loud so watching TV may be any issue.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the unit, the bonnet and the amount of heat this little gadget generates.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud</li>
            <li> This gives me just a little lift and keeps my curls in their (nearly natural) position as my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> The machine can be a little loud depending how you set it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose attaches at the base of the bonnet, and even though some other reviewers have had a problem with the hot hose touching their necks and backs while it was in use, I have found that the ballooning of the bonnet once turned on causes the hose to stand away from my body and not touch me at all.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing that I can say about this is that the hose is a bit particular about how it has to be attached into the hood to stay in.  </li>
            <li> I usually put my hair dryers settings on high--</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on high customer reviews, but was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also have long thick hair along with a large size head.</li>
            <li> I have the hot cold high and low settings which is all you really need and your not trapped under thos big bulky dryers unable to move.</li>
            <li> The drawstrings are useless when it comes to making it fit the head.</li>
            <li> Thanks for rectifying my complaint Amazon.</li>
            <li> Reasonable purchase, if clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> Those are minor things to deal with for the price and easiness.</li>
            <li> I will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> So, for that only being the minus on the product i&#x27;d say this is a must get.</li>
            <li> I sat under the cap for an hour (drove me nuts to sit in once place that long).</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal for this product or if I have a defective product?</li>
            <li> Dries my long hair in 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have purchased and used a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have long locs.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and like to use a dozen jumbo curlers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud at all so if your drying your hair</li>
            <li> I have long locks</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t long before it got stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position.  </li>
            <li> I have had dreads for five years now, which means they are long.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had owned it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> then I expected,I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I know when I wet it, it will curl back up, but the bonnet shouldn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Next time I spent 45 minutes prepping my hair with velcro rollers, put on the cap and nothing....</li>
            <li> As long as Laila continues to invest in promoting quality products I will give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair).</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s difficult to completely close the bottom and hot air escapes.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to just below the middle of my back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a constant to struggle dry my hair when I have to hold the cord in with my hand to keep it in the bonnet!!</li>
            <li> It usually take my hair about 45 minutes to dry on high under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a wet set last this long!  </li>
            <li> I would have assigned this dryer the full five stars if only Ms. Ali had offered replacement soft bonnets as well--now apparently impossible to find anywhere for any brand at any price.</li>
            <li> Only that I would have preferred the black bonnet (how it was in the picture I saw), but received it with a white bonnet.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that after 20-25 minutes under the dryer the middle of your head is dry but the front and sides where the cooling holes are still extremely wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and below my armpit and it dried in under two hours.</li>
            <li> Just got tired of not being able to do other things while I dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would allow me to sit at computer or watch TV while I wait for my hair to dry - even with a dryer it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> (my hair always takes a long time to dry) without burning my neck or ears or face.</li>
            <li> And, it takes a really long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly long dreadlocks, and getting them dry after washing is a challenge.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is that she thinks it is a little too hot on her head.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had, and eventually solved, was getting the bonnet tight enough and keeping it in place.</li>
            <li> The cord is very uncomfortable,its too short and its very hard to pull out/store</li>
            <li> must say that this dryer could be a bit uncomfortable on the high heat, high speed setting.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to use it I made sure it was twisted into position and carefully put the hose behind me.</li>
            <li> A lot of them really do not get hot enough to dry my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews where people said they had trouble with the bonnet staying on their heads if they were not using large rollers.  </li>
            <li> Well, it was&#x27;t until after I received the dryer that I realized the video posted for THIS product, is actually for the other Ali dryer.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star but the Bonnet is not big enough for my jumbo rollers, it fits but barely and because of that the air doesn&#x27;t distribute as well to the front, so I have to switch the hose to the front for at least 20 min.</li>
            <li> Only took off a star because it burns you a little in the back, after having it on for a while.</li>
            <li> Noise level is about the same as any other dryer</li>
            <li> I have updated the rating to 4 stars from 1 star due to my initial experience.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet material around the elastic cracks and splits due to hardening - probably from a combination of the heat and possibly hair products or water.  </li>
            <li> The dryer I originally wanted to purchase (portable salon dryer) was out of stock , and I felt like the other dryers would be a waste of money because of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally exploring styles other than a \\&quot;press\\&quot; or curly fro or ponytail.</li>
            <li> The dryer is extremely lightweight but also has enough heat capacity so that I do not have sit under the dryer all day!</li>
            <li> As a natural red head with long, thick, unmanageable curls this product is now my lifeline.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in less time that expected and all of my large rollers fit&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> not hot enough, takes for ever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and use 1 in rollers.</li>
            <li> I said, I had high hopes, but now I&#x27;ll be returning it and getting a hard had dryer instead.</li>
            <li> However, I went to use the product this morning to dry my hair after washing it.</li>
            <li> So, I am stuck trying to dry my hair in the front by turning the bonnet around backwards.</li>
            <li> I used to have a hooded dryer which took over an hour to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I twist and wrap it up to dry it.</li>
            <li> Takes about an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> How am I suppose to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It took 30 or 45 minutes to completely dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It does get my hair dry, but I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I prefer to let my hair air dry a bit before use to limit my dryer time.</li>
            <li> and I need them to dry</li>
            <li> I slip it on and my hair is dry within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair takes HOURS to dry and this dryer does the trick.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t dry evenly.</li>
            <li> so it takes no time for your hair to dry.</li>
            <li> - I use it to dry my hair for about an hour</li>
            <li> The drier itself is ok...convenient and will dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t intend to use it to completely dry my hair</li>
            <li> though-not even the beauty salon/high price hair dryers completely dry my hair with rollers etc.</li>
            <li> I find that using rollers lets my hair stay styled longer than blowing it dry or using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> it takes hours to air dry.</li>
            <li> and my hair is dry no matter what style I am doing.</li>
            <li> Bought to help dry my daughters hair to set curls.</li>
            <li> This dryer will dry your hair but not burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> Though it takes awhile to dry my hair</li>
            <li> so I could do styles at home and not have to wait all day for curls to dry or sleep in curlers.</li>
            <li> This product probably would work but the heating hose kept falling out of the machine when I tried to dry my hair on rollers.</li>
            <li> Dry my hair all around.</li>
            <li> The heat spreads evenly and I never have to worry about shifting the bonnet around to fully dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stay under a bonnet dryer for hours until my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> So it takes longer to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I thought that this will never get my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is dry . . .</li>
            <li> The portable overhead used to dry my hair in 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair will usually dry if I keep the bonnet on for 3 or 4 hours off and on with the curlers in.</li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair anywhere in the house</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and use rollers to dry it.</li>
            <li> but my hair was suuuper salon head-drier dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works, puts out a reasonable amount of heat, used it for 4 straight hours during a cold winter drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Laila dryer does dry my hair but does not give it the softness.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take about 2 hours to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It used to take me 1 hour to dry my hair...</li>
            <li> and I allow my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> (like write reviews on Amazon) while you dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the hair takes longer to dry because of this.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and had no body before</li>
            <li> You can dry your hair while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so it takes longer to dry those parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guarantee if you try it with curlers, it will not move around when turned on and will dry your hair while you read a book, email, etc.  </li>
            <li> I like to roll my hair on the velcro curlers and then dry it with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The product did not heat or dry evenly.  </li>
            <li> I did not have rollers in my hair, was just drying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes 2 hours just to get my hair somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> and it feels really dry</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry scalp anyways though.</li>
            <li> so I can set my style after my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I received dryer, and didn&#x27;t open it until about a few months later and it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> so you dont want it touching your direct skin, it also does tend to unhook from the cord and bonnet which is annoying because you have to keep installing it.</li>
            <li> It also was not new.</li>
            <li> What a hassle to get the item missing a major piece</li>
            <li> My old dryer needed a very particular arrangement to work which left me sitting quite awkwardly as I couldn&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li> and the hose is limited.  </li>
            <li> Also the heat setting is limited.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and usually it takes forever for my hair to dry when I twist it or braid it,</li>
            <li> My hair is past shoulder length and when doing roller sets, it is capable of drying fully in an hour, which used to take me an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it for a  deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t comment and leave negative feedback</li>
            <li> We did use a towel behind the neck just in case it got too hot, but it never felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I think the first reviewer is confused.</li>
            <li> If I turn my head the hose comes loose 80% of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad loose, you have to play with it to connect it.</li>
            <li> Hose that connects to bonnet comes loose from time to time.</li>
            <li> It requires me to sit under the dryer less than half the time of my old dryer.</li>
            <li> (it only opens to a 90 degree angle and falls down if you move around, obstructing the vent)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not enough for me to rate this dryer down, though.</li>
            <li> and it is the triangle that is actually holding it on lock down.  </li>
            <li> have eyed various hair bonnet driers due to the fact that my hair is thick and natural and takes forever to air dry.</li>
            <li> Even if I turn my head only slightly, it comes loose</li>
            <li> I use large rollers but the bonnet was very hard to accommodate over the head.</li>
            <li> Now I can lay in bed and take a nap while I dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered the white one, used it, asked Amazon to replace it with the black one and they sent me the while one AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I would make is a slightly longer cord.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in previous reviews, the hose does slip out and when I actually looked at it, it&#x27;s a design flaw by manufactures.</li>
            <li> SO when my hair was dry, I had to fluff it out</li>
            <li> Simple to use and compact enough so that it can be stored in a small space.</li>
            <li> The bonnet and hose are colored white instead of black.  </li>
            <li> I like that the whose and bonnet are both black where as in the picture they&#x27;re white.</li>
            <li> I also use a small towel on the back of my neck for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Using this model one only needs a half hour because its ionic.  </li>
            <li> the setting and especially the colors: purple and black</li>
            <li> I have long rather thick hair that is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little confused because it wouldn&#x27;t open, then I realized the bonnet cap and hose was on the side.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I also alternate between the high speed setting and low speed setting because the heat also feels uncomfortable on my scalp.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair into a tangled mess, the low setting is plenty heat......</li>
            <li> The only slight problem is that sometimes, when you move, because of the heat, the tube turns in the socket and comes apart from the bonnet (sorry if my English is not good enough to describe this precisely).</li>
            <li> The bonnet, however is a little hard to get over large curlers.  </li>
            <li> Even with product in my hair following ALL the directions I came out with a fluffy, halfway dry, cap shaped hair.</li>
            <li> The ONLY THING is that the strings do not tie on as tightly, and I wish they would change this.</li>
            <li> The elastic strings don&#x27;t pull tight enough so the bonnet starts to slip away from the front a bit.</li>
            <li> Pull the drawstrings tight, Tie the strings around the front and and then tie it in the back.</li>
            <li> Hose from dryer to bonnet too short, bonnet too tight.</li>
            <li> I am being very careful with the case, handle and bonnet connection and hope it stands up to long term usage.</li>
            <li> downfall is that the cord is not very long so you must be sitting within a few feet from the outlet.</li>
            <li> Takes less time to dry, even on the medium setting(with hard cover I always needed to use the high heat setting)</li>
            <li> The bonnet was a little big ,but adjustable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag was a little big for her head though but we made it work.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes on the medium setting and a little over an hour on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> Then a little wisp of smoke floated across my face and I realized that something inside the motor was burning with the setting switched to low.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but it was a little bothersome at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could SOMEONE put a LITTLE MONEY into making a product that will LAST FOR GOSH SAKE????  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this dryer is it burned a little on my neck</li>
            <li> After dealing with frizzy twist/braid outs due to my hair not being completely dry in the morning, I decided to jump the threshold and purchase this dryer.</li>
            <li> so when I come home at night and have to do the routine I am a little discouraged because I know that the next morning my hair will still be wet.  </li>
            <li> The one I purchased was in the flat case and it was purple and black.  </li>
            <li> Every other method I have tried....setting and sleeping on the set overnight, air dry, using a hair dryer with a bonnet attachment...</li>
            <li> it dry my hair faster than other products I tried before.</li>
            <li> but it fit  a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> who is in nursing home and can&#x27;t take getting blown dry due to the heat on her head</li>
            <li> I needed a soft bonnet as I didn&#x27;t want to be encumbered by a hard hat version.  </li>
            <li> this replaced an old hard bonnet dryer that crapped the bed after year sof faithful service.  </li>
            <li> The other problem is, if I place the hose at the back of my head, the hair in the front gets less heat.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to find a comfortable position to sit in using my hard cover dryer and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Also, the the narrow base means it&#x27;s easy to tip it over and, during operation, the thing actually &amp;#34;travels&amp;#34; on the counter (due to the vibrations caused while operating) and frequently falls over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, but I think that&#x27;s common.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m penalized for buying a Xmas gift early because it&#x27;s to late to return it.</li>
            <li> Several people who bought different brands complained that their dryer would automatically shut off after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hose from the box to the bonnet is extremely short.</li>
            <li> I had a similar dryer that my Mom had bought for me back in the late 1980&#x27;s manufactured by CONAIR</li>
            <li> but I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Also got the package a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Last time I used it ( I think my hair dried in 45 mintues).  </li>
            <li> again, it&#x27;s to be expected because of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste time and effort trying to send it back.</li>
            <li> It dries my  damp hair in about 30 minutes and wet hair in about 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say it is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I would return it, but conveniently the window of returns just closed.</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> so that I don&#x27;t go to bed with wet hair.</li>
            <li> there are only a few things i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> so i have to tie the extra string round my head to make it feel like its not going to move.</li>
            <li> The loudness of the item is as expected.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> So you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I was not too rough with the hose</li>
            <li> The settings and design are simple but not cheap.</li>
            <li> The practicality of this portable device has been totally lost as the power regulators are heavy.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful putting the bonnet on with rollers</li>
            <li> Be careful if planning to buy</li>
            <li> but i guess that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Did a deep condition with the J Beverly Hills masque and dried our hair.</li>
            <li> , the vendor shipped it faster than I expected and it came well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I expected the bonnet to be</li>
            <li> so I expected it to be a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> spent holding a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> but once u turn the heat off your hair feels a lil wet???</li>
            <li> It is noisy, like a hair dryer, but that should be expected.  </li>
            <li> I am relaxed, and did not want to use a hand dryer to style my hair after getting it wet.  </li>
            <li> Also, it can be irritating if you are sensitive in the back area of your head toward your neck.  </li>
            <li> so bonnet will lean to one side, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little stiff to get all the stuff back in the case, but overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quite well.  </li>
            <li> I have 3A type curls and long hair (down to backside)</li>
            <li> I took a long piece of satin fabric that I sometimes use to tie down my hair and I wrapped it around the perimeter of the bonnet, kinda like if you were putting on a bandana.</li>
            <li> I took a long piece of satin fabric that I sometimes use to tie down my hair and I wrapped it around the perimeter of the bonnet, kinda like if you were putting on a bandana.</li>
            <li> This Laila dryer is difficult to stuff back together, compared to that old, inexpensive conair which is the only other one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Apparently with this model the nozzle can be replaced if torn due to excessive heat or wear and tear,</li>
            <li> Laila Ali&#x27;s dryer was a last ditch effort to tame the fro.</li>
            <li> The dryer aslo gets very hot, will burn the back of your neckand ears if you dont place a towel around it, very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am African American with THICK (not sure of type) hair, currently transitioning,</li>
            <li> I sit and do things on my I-pad and have even laid down and relaxed while letting my hair dry.</li>
            <li> other than that is money well spent, thank you.</li>
            <li> The only con is the storage area for the cord and bonnet, it&#x27;s very tight.</li>
            <li> The bonnet that comes with this dryer is too small and I am unable to fit it over all the curlers without messing up the set.</li>
            <li> Can easily dry hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> The dryer DOES dry my hair in about half the time it takes under a hooded dryer...about (45min--an hour instead of 1.5-2 hrs.).</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour and a half to fully dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d need to dry my hair for about an hour to an hour and a half with the Laila Ali dryer.</li>
            <li> This works just as I hoped, so my hair is dry in 10min or less.</li>
            <li> Thick, Long, Shoulder-Length (curly-natural), Under-Shoulder Blades (straight-blow dry/heat), 4a/b around head (front &amp; back), 4c in the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I wish the hose was a little longer but these types of dryers don&#x27;t have long hoses.</li>
            <li> I have very long (waist length), thick and coarse hair that I always set in twists or braids after washing.  </li>
            <li> I use this dryer daily to dry my mid-length thick hair.</li>
            <li> the way all other latches of this type have been).</li>
            <li> I was worried about the size of the bonnet given the other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews where people are saying that the hose disconnects while in use</li>
            <li> So you may have to put a TShirt or towel around your neck to help deal with the heat but other</li>
            <li> The nozzle that fits inside the dryer has since torn due to heat.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I will recomend it.</li>
            <li> so I can do work at the computer or other things while using it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Usually I have to touch it up with a curling iron the next day, and forget about day three</li>
            <li> The bonnet was droopy due to size.  </li>
            <li> It retracted, you just pushed it back into its hole on the small side</li>
            <li> It was white like the one they are now selling through Amazon, and small.  </li>
            <li> This only happens in a small space, but I end up having to put something there to block the air, like a kleenex.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the low setting and the bonnet stays on well in that setting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to sit under it all day with my roller sets like I have to with other dryers.</li>
            <li> But other than this ...</li>
            <li> I put a  small hand towel around the back of my neck as advised in one of the reviews to avoid the heat bothering my neck</li>
            <li> Due to the cost of returning the item I decided to cut my losses.</li>
            <li> I think something was wrong with the cap because it became unbearable hot where the hose was plugged into the cap.</li>
            <li> I put one in this and tell him to brush his teeth, use a blow dryer on the other.  </li>
            <li> but I found other uses for it as well.  </li>
            <li> I usually take it out just about the same.</li>
            <li> I just noticed the other 2 types of dryers and may buy one of those as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Now can do other work while drying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return it because I failed to test out the product when I first received it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The hose is longer than on the other dryer making the positioning versatile despite the limitations from the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened this bonnet I was NOT impressed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I deceided that I would start coloring my hair at home due to the cost of salon coloring.</li>
            <li> I like that there are four heat settings (although I usually use only the \\&quot;High/Hot\\&quot; setting).</li>
            <li> For this small section I use a regular blow drier.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that all my past bonnet dryers had a similar smell.</li>
            <li> so i just rotate it to cover other areas</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely noisy no matter</li>
            <li> I can do other things while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how it holds up over the next few months, and maybe I will review my rating!</li>
            <li> other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product has been updated but the model number is the same.</li>
            <li> Other folks said they needed a towel to protect their necks from the heat.</li>
            <li> the heating levels, excelent and as stated in other reviews heat is well kept inside.</li>
            <li> Priced comparable to other bonnet dryers.</li>
            <li> On the other end I have a paper towel to hold the hose into the machine.</li>
            <li> I could do other things while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer is extremely lightweight, so I have to put it in my lap while I adjust the bonnet, and I can&#x27;t move around or it will fall,</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> In other words, my scalp be burning cause</li>
            <li> Other than that,  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> so there are no hot spots and because the air is coming out all over the hood</li>
            <li> then I had expected!  </li>
            <li> And it dries faster than her other model.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the hose to stay in due to a loose fit and kept getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful with handling it.</li>
            <li> my hair is still very wet.  </li>
            <li> have very thick and curly biracial hair (African American and Caucasian).</li>
            <li> I have a short, pixie cut and my hair is naturally coarse and very thick.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tighten/loosen the (not so) adjustable band, so the bonnet either slips down my forehead, or hangs loosely in the back.  </li>
            <li> It is not constructed well, and it is almost impossible to secure it around my head.  </li>
            <li> I usually put a small stole near my T.V. And plug up the dryer.</li>
            <li> (It would usually take that long with shorter hair not in rollers with other dryers).</li>
            <li> The only complaint is which other have stated is when you turn it on the hood can come off</li>
            <li> The hose attachment to the bonnet is a little awkward for a person lying on a pillow, but that is a special situation</li>
            <li> It gets CRAZY HOT!  </li>
            <li> I always have a hard time drying my hair with a regular dryer-my hair gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see if I can purchase some glue to seal the hose back in the hard plastic nozzle thing.</li>
            <li> Spend extra and get a hard hood dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair can be hard to manage at times, especially now in the colder months.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is hard to get back in case.</li>
            <li> My head is rather average</li>
            <li> I like the dryer, however have only one complaint.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer awhile back and have used it at least 3-4 times now.</li>
            <li> Whether drying out my 3&#x27; long locs or just setting a few rod curls on the ends, this is the woman for the job!</li>
            <li> At least this one is only $33 (now it&#x27;s that price.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is not portable.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for at least several years</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to give Laila the side eye for putting her name on a mediocre product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more annoying when it pops out of the cap</li>
            <li> have past my shoulders thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair in the same amount of time as my previous hard, heavy-duty hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It took me approximately the same amount of time to dry my hair as with my hard-hood dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I kept it tied down with a scarf.</li>
            <li> It rides up so that I have to keep pulling it down to keep it over my hair.  </li>
            <li> But when I turned the dryer over facing down, the noise level was reduced drastically.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I have to turn down the settings or rotate where the hose is blowing</li>
            <li> The heat bears down on my neck, ears, and eyes.</li>
            <li> I had to try to hold the strings down</li>
            <li> I am now laying it down with the air flow vent facing up.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with this falling down over my eyes.</li>
            <li> My solution is to put a towel around the neck under the bonnet an tie down.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the tube is a little short, but if longer, it might make the drier work too hard.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected and on time!!</li>
            <li> UNTIL, one day I just decided to twist the hose a little harder when I attached it to the bonnet, AND IT STAYED!</li>
            <li> I have been using a hairdryer with a diffuser for years- would get lazy and let it air dry halfway.</li>
            <li> I have course hair which usually takes some time to dry but not with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Probably not worth the trouble, other than just to have a project.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 2-3 hours to air dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for completely dry</li>
            <li> The cap is not that strong :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bonnet may slide down but only if you have a very small head like a child.</li>
            <li> and it barley reaches and will fall down if I move even slightly.</li>
            <li> The while one pictured and the black one from the video reviews.</li>
            <li> Odd, since you have to twist lock it in place.</li>
            <li> Looked similar, but from what the reviews said,  its not the same one at all and getting it apart and together is difficult.  </li>
            <li> With Amazon Prime I received it in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I was under the dryer for about an hour and a half but still slightly damp.</li>
            <li> But my hair always took an hour and a half with the salon dryers.</li>
            <li> My item has a black bonnet.</li>
            <li> Just remember to twist hose in helmet until a slight click is heard or felt; that hose can worm its way out.</li>
            <li> It work for less than a minute and since than I can&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> so I can be under the dryer for less than and hour</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> Stopped using it because the black bonnet was a drawstring and kept sliding off.</li>
            <li> Less drying.</li>
            <li> Less frazzled.  </li>
            <li> The unit I&#x27;d used previously consisted of just the fan unit with a bag holding the accessories.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon has updated their photo of this product since I posted my previous review.</li>
            <li> Got tired of leaving the house with wet, white (from styling creams) hair</li>
            <li> The 3rd time I used the dryer I managed to keep the hose attached to the bonnet by wrapping a piece of cloth around the connection point, only to discover after 15 minutes of drying that the hose became disconnected from the plastic piece that connects to the bonnet rendering the dryer completely useless.</li>
            <li> My previous bonnet dryer never moved out of place.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the bonnet back in its compartment after use, then it&#x27;s very hard to get it back out to use again.  </li>
            <li> I have dreaded the hard shell hair dryers for OH so long and</li>
            <li> Like previous reviewers have said that there is really no cool setting.</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid to order the dryer because I wrap my hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like it because it kept cutting off whenever it got too hot, so</li>
            <li> My hair is long and course thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is so long and thick</li>
            <li> If your hair is long and thick like mine.</li>
            <li> It took me 5 mins to figure out that you twist and turn so the hose comes out of the hose compartment and the little black door on the side opens and that is where you will find the cord and cap.</li>
            <li> Instead it&#x27;s a tight cap with</li>
            <li> I then attempted to connect the hose to the bonnet, since it would take a cirque de soleil contortionist to struggle with the tight bonnet WHILE it&#x27;s connected to the unit.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle was so tight in the area were the heat comes from it could not be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I use Conair&#x27;s Velcro Rollers and it is a really tight squeeze getting the bonnet on over them.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too tight, but it also is snug around my head.</li>
            <li> I find that the drawstring closes tightly as well.</li>
            <li> My Wife&#x27;s hair is hard to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick natural hair and my hair dries usually within one hour and some change.</li>
            <li> My proactive idea to connect after was futile because after five minutes of feeling around blindly to connect the hose, I did so, only for it to come out when I sat down to dry.  </li>
            <li> But, now it&#x27;s useless and I have to invest in something new.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry in half the time it usually takes!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this dryer worked well until piece came apart.from bonnet on first use!!!!</li>
            <li> (I had to replace my previous hair dryer--still functional--because the cap dried out over time and tore.)  </li>
            <li> and it dried evenly in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me say although I love this dryer, I am not sure as to why the hose disconnected from the base.</li>
            <li> The only thing is i have a small head and when my hair is drying the head piece slowly slides off.</li>
            <li> The 2 annoying problems, but can be easily remedied is 1, the product is designed in a slim style and you have to make a decision as to whether to stand it up and because it is lightweight</li>
            <li> I used this dryer on my roller set and they dried within less than an hr</li>
            <li> I am going to give it a little time to air out and try again</li>
            <li> I gave it to a little girl I know.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that there is a lot of profit being made on this item because it delivers so little to the consumer.</li>
            <li> But I find if I wrap or hold a towel over my ears it does help (a little).</li>
            <li> She use it even though the cap is a little had for her</li>
            <li> There is a little door that opens for the cord and to store the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little section to store the bonnet.</li>
            <li> A little tricky getting them under there, but  </li>
            <li> : The bonnet opens up around my hairline in the front and feels like little hairs are tickling my face...</li>
            <li> It smooshes my hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> Wish the tube were a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy</li>
            <li> Cord could be a little longer.</li>
            <li> using the product for a little over a year I find</li>
            <li> If I were to change anything, I would make the hose a little longer.</li>
            <li> However, ensuring no hot air blew out and burned me was hit or miss, usually miss.</li>
            <li> However, ensuring no hot air blew out and burned me was hit or miss, usually miss.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I put little clips in my hair then blowdry.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because the bonnet could be a little tighter to hold in the heat..</li>
            <li> It just needs to be a little hotter.</li>
            <li> Heats up like a little champ.</li>
            <li> A little note would have helped, I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t think that just because it&#x27;s little and compact that it will not put out the work that you rely and trust in.</li>
            <li> but this has been very disappointing and huge inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> What a let down!  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dryer but was disappointed for the following 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> My one disappointment is that the bonnet isn&#x27;t a big bigger.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all it takes for towel dried hair of my thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The cord is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I would like to return it, but I&#x27;m not going to the trouble.</li>
            <li> Poor product overall.</li>
            <li> My curls look shorter because they were completely dried with a hairdryer, rather than limp from air drying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> An improvement on the ones I had as a teenager, but does the job I need it to do -- get my jumbo curlers under wraps and dried in record time.</li>
            <li> Not Fantastic but</li>
            <li> The case tends to fall over when you stand it on the narrow edge.</li>
            <li> It seems to stay if the entire thing is behind you instead of on the side or whatever.</li>
            <li> I have only used this thing 10 times while seated, upright, on a stable surface, so I am confused as to why it has gave out.</li>
            <li> $50 wasted.</li>
            <li> This dryer dried my hair in 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> when I found it a few days ago plus shipping... breaks my heart</li>
            <li> However, the second dryer looked even worse.  </li>
            <li> Like I seen a few others say, the bonnet wouldn&#x27;t stay attached.</li>
            <li> But I have not had any trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the cord and the bonnet was missing</li>
            <li> Had one a few years ago but the cap split</li>
            <li> And I thought with a fragile item like this they will bubble wrap it or something, alas,</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> We shall see what I get for round 2.  </li>
            <li> The cap does not fit well over the largest rollers.  </li>
            <li> It is almost like there is something missing in the temp control design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dryer allows her to have her hair washed, set and dried while in bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for the replacement bonnet, which has elastic , but it is not available by itself.</li>
            <li> So I wrapped it and dried in 30 mins...  </li>
            <li> but once you move the hose closer to the front for just a few minutes thats all it takes</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have the ability to levitate inanimate objects, I put it on a rectangular waste bin shortwise like the letter</li>
            <li> Literally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> i just wish it had a longer tube to work with and a firm stand</li>
            <li> Also, it was here in a few days, not 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste my time trying it again.  </li>
            <li> the bonnets waaaaaay too big and its poorly made...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Not certain if I received a defective dryer, or if power is really this bad.  </li>
            <li> I found a way around his by just tightening it like usual AND bringing the string around to the front of my head and tying it to the front holding down the edge of the cap keeping it from sliding off.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl, and I hate how long it takes for my twists to dry.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the bonnet dryer, I was incredibly frustrated with how the hose continuously became detached from the bonnet (like previous owners had warned).</li>
            <li> faster aaand with less heat than a blow drier!</li>
            <li> AND THE BONNET IS STIFF..</li>
            <li> These type of dryers are not easy to find, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The hose is permanently attached to the unit so you have to put the bonnet on and then snap the hose on (not easy).</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly long hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about 4/5 months and already the hose has twisted and about to tear off --- I really did like this dryer but DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the side where the on/off and settings are, is the same side as the hose which makes for a oddly placed and difficult to navigate activity.  </li>
            <li> It does get alittle hot sometimes but nothing that bad.</li>
            <li> I usually have to turn the bonnet around so the front of my hair gets dried.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I would find a delicate balance that would allow me to tolerate the configuration of the bonnet and towels/fabric stuffed into the base of the bonnet but it meant that I couldn&#x27;t really move around at all.</li>
            <li> It takes hours to dry my hair (I have locks) and know the poor quality bonnet has come apart.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to wait for hours for my hair to dry after at twisting it.</li>
            <li> Hose slips, that&#x27;s super annoying.</li>
            <li> &gt; The little bit of the pessimist in me won&#x27;t allow me to give it 5 stars yet tho&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Their thick curly hair gets very dry and difficult to manage, but since receiving this as a Christmas present it has made it easier for the girls to manage their thick locks of curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it is also a little hard to do.</li>
            <li> I have very little time to nurture my hair</li>
            <li> im deployed given the climate conditions and very little access to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair</li>
            <li> I also like that everything fits neatly into the case and it takes up very little space when storing and using.  </li>
            <li> It is the thickness of a Webster&#x27;s dictionary and I takes up very little space in the closet shelf.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews on this item; this thing is too noisy!!!</li>
            <li> The high heat setting can occasionally be unpleasant on exposed skin (ears, neck, forehead).</li>
            <li> This little dryer is not very attractive but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The air hose was difficult to keep attached to the bonnet and was uncomfortably short.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why, because I put it on and sit in one place.  </li>
            <li> I usually sit in a roller-set at the hairdresser for an hour.  </li>
            <li> The air comes out of the bottom and is usually unbearable on my neck</li>
            <li> The reason this is 4 stars, is because this can be actually dangerous as far as burning you on the hose and cap, not from the air on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if i&#x27;ll recommend this bonnet.</li>
            <li> Not sure if replacing the cap will solve the problem</li>
            <li> but it is unfortunate that this item did not even last a year.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair always ends up frizzy wild woman crazy.</li>
            <li> I not sure what that is,it doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I want an exchange.</li>
            <li> that usually takes 1.5 hours under a salon dryer.</li>
            <li> so I usually read while drying my hair instead of watching TV...</li>
            <li> I usually wrap the hose in its spot and roll the hood up and place it into its spot and close it and put away.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure why it came apart</li>
            <li> However, I was left disappointed after I actually used the dryer.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that I would like this product</li>
            <li> Usually I have to sit under the plastic hooded dryer forever</li>
            <li> I usually wear a plastic cap and then a head scarf under the hood to cover my ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the material itself is --</li>
            <li> and she has the same problem as well.m of the heat shooting out, but I was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the picture you are seeing on this item, WAS NOT the picture I seen when I first decided to buy the item.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this would smush my hair and asked that question here of people who&#x27;d used this in the past.  </li>
            <li> Have used this type of dryers over the past 50 years and this one did not compare as to comfort.</li>
            <li> Every small twist of my head</li>
            <li> Was never sure.  </li>
            <li> Its sleek, small, but sturdy.</li>
            <li> There is a small compartment where the hair bag (bonet)  and cord is located.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like this</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m not sure yet if I&#x27;m keeping this or exchanging for another model yet,</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I received the item pictured (white hose, white bonnet) and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay on properly unless you sit in a somewhat uncomfortable spot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not open it in time to find out before the deadline to return this product.</li>
            <li> and I just sat in my bed and watched a movie while I dried my hair!</li>
            <li> After the first use, I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular hard bonnet dryers gave me a headache and made my neck stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium-length, very thick and extremely curly.</li>
            <li> The hose that attaches to the bonnet is very heavy</li>
            <li> The bonnet hose - while conveniently stored within the chassis of the unit, is difficult to extract and really hard to compress back into the unit.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is the hose, and it&#x27;s annoying enough to take off 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it was so hard to meet that criteria, but Laila did it and then some.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it is very difficult to get a refund on Amazon as they do not have a direct email or phone #.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and it is LOUD.</li>
            <li> dryer would not work at all on the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting (making it useless to set the curl once it was dry) and the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very disappointed that the item wasn&#x27;t available, needed it for a client that was schedule for a hair appointment on Saturday June 8, 2013.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a hard hooded dryer as a replacement for this one.</li>
            <li> She uses hard plastic rollers and the attached hood fits her well.  </li>
            <li> The tube kept detaching and the bonnet was hard to put over my curlers.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a bonnet dryer to replace my Gold-N-Hot hard bonnet dryer that died.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is hard to adjust into the lid coming off often.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I did have a hard time with getting the bonnet to stay on</li>
            <li> I looked at the hard bonnet type hood dryers and then I found this one.  </li>
            <li> But because of the fan you have to put it on a hard surface so that it won&#x27;t overheat.</li>
            <li> I have a hard bonnet dryer too</li>
            <li> Kept me from having to use my bulky hard dryer, Did the job I wanted.</li>
            <li> So if you are annoyed by this, just do a little experimenting</li>
            <li> I ordered this despite the negative feedback  I read.</li>
            <li> Air flow sucks.  </li>
            <li> The item I received appears to be cheaply made with horrible quality plastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought it in late March 2014.  </li>
            <li> My mom had one that lasted at least 40 years.  </li>
            <li> She can study opinion her room or even the common room.  </li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s no warm.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> then brush your hair with thick hair brush.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap and it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastically for my thick frizzy prone hair, mid-back length mane.</li>
            <li> and I have both thick hair and thick density.</li>
            <li> I have notably thick and dense hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for all the thick, naturalistas out there.</li>
            <li> I do have to wear a thick headband under it because the heat hits my ears and does burn a bit.</li>
            <li> , I have thick hair and it takes me about 40 minutes to try i on curlers.</li>
            <li> so I have thick twist wrapped around my head and barbie pinned and the air still got through it.  </li>
            <li> And I mean noisy.  </li>
            <li> The power that this machine has in unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Dries quicker than usual 2-4 hours!</li>
            <li> My complaints: the storage compartment for the cord and bonnet is ridiculously small at the opening!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and was not sure about buying this thing !</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this dryer due to some reviews</li>
            <li> I usually sit in bed watching tv with this on my head!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tie it at all and tuck the bonnet behind my ears, or tie very tightly around the forehead.</li>
            <li> Was hard to get over my biggest rollers and was difficult to keep tight on my rollers.</li>
            <li> Now my 17yr old is disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesnt get cold after a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Seriously, who has five+ hours to spare air drying their hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item did not distribute match air but seriously overheated in a matter of minutes,  It even had an overheated smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a serious hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Seriously tempted to break off the lid and reattach with velcro and then find a way to sawzall the extraneous parts off and just keep the fan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad at myself for not purchasing this dryer a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to use but did the job</li>
            <li> little cave can be difficult.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It has a handle on it which is a little weird to me, but I suppose people do travel with their hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> But one day I twisted the nozzle a little tighter and</li>
            <li> The hood can be a little difficult to adjust to your head size</li>
            <li> If you are tired of the hard hat dryer, get this one.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not a good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The fact that there were no real instructions was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The item is not good for drying 3c curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now early Sept and the hose is no longer attached to the base unit.  </li>
            <li> The dryer worked well but the other parts were disappointing.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe my hair!</li>
            <li> Force of air weak, won&#x27;t inflate cap.  </li>
            <li> But at least I con get a roller set at home at 10pm when I can&#x27;t get to any hair salon!</li>
            <li> have been waiting for the motor to go out on my Gold N&#x27; Hot dryer since I bought about 6 years ago because of the annoying heat settings and the awkward cover</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I had to tie the scarf so tight that it felt like I was cutting off</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I had to tie the scarf so tight that it felt like I was cutting off</li>
            <li> I have very thick corse hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which has been chemically treated and this dryer worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I decided to wash and dry my hair after my kids went to bed since that is my quite time to do work and other stuff- bad idea!!!</li>
            <li> The tube that attaches to the bonnet is tricky as you are doing it behind your head and if it rotates it might fall off.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality bonnet and hose connection.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail today 11/20/13 and its BROKEN....</li>
            <li> Where the handle is on the front the latch is BROKEN</li>
            <li> The low/high switch is broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I encountered some of the negative experiences  shared by some of the reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The hood&#x27;s spring was broken \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; by Hubby.</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s broken already.</li>
            <li> the hose could be a bit longer, making it easier to place it behind you and move around a bit&lt;</li>
            <li> and I was never happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I knocked off a star because the tube that goes from the machine to the headpiece,  is wayyy to small, which is inconvenient if you are applying your makeup (moving around) while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that Amazon did a horrible job with the shipping</li>
            <li> Sadly, the hose had broken on it</li>
            <li> Its sad when you pay your money and get a poor product.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the attachment was defective.</li>
            <li> It is also uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I returned it and went with one I found at Sally.</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy so watching TV is difficult unless you are alone and can turn volume way up.  </li>
            <li> SO ANGRY.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is a tad uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this dryer.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a big disappointment!!!!!</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t want to be uncomfortable while sitting under a dryer for hours.</li>
            <li> I was not totally impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> It sounds a bit weird because I do get bored while blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> Amazon is shipping a replacement item which I am skeptical in receiving.  </li>
            <li> Sad.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> thought I had a solution to the problem of the heat shooting out, but I was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> i brought this for my mother in law ,she loves it because she can set on the couch ,because she is unable to stand.</li>
            <li> Difficult to position cap on head.</li>
            <li> You will look quite weird while wearing it</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to keep the bonnet attached to the hose.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I feel like it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to make the bonnet stay in place when hooking it to the tube nozzle sometimes but this product still manages to deliver.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it to stay on your head unless you rig the shoelace tightening string</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird that they didn&#x27;t make it snap into place.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> However, it is very frustrating to use when the tube keep falling out of the cap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating to spend 1 hour putting flexi rods (or any form of roller set) in your hair and not have the results you were looking for because of a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Afraid of starting a fire, I turned it off and to say I&#x27;m disappointed would be an understatement :(</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and a awkward to wear.</li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> Afraid to carry it by the handle as it looks so flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This thing is just awkward.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid that without handling with kid gloves, both the bonnet and the dryer tubing will break.</li>
            <li> I used to have the standalone dryer where I had sit in one place - and that just felt inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It has a cold shot</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Still really disappointed in this dryer, but sad to say -</li>
            <li> I have had hooded dryers in the past and hated then!!</li>
            <li> too difficult to get the hood on; very awkward with the hood and the hose.</li>
            <li> The on button is very difficult to push.  </li>
            <li> what setting 2) very difficult to keep the hose attached to the bonnet.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they changed the design.</li>
            <li> Bad hose length.</li>
            <li> I DID READ THE REVIEWS, &amp; EVEN THOUGH SOME WERE BAD</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this jumped up in price so much...I need to buy another as a gift....</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have to unplug it :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a lot when it comes to these things, but was still disappointed.</li>

            <li> Ughhh, I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that today&#x27;s companies can&#x27;t make a reliable, well made portable bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this dryer</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Dryer blows cold air!</li>
            <li> Frizz like crazy!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of Laila Ali and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This item was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> That gets really annoying.  </li>
            <li> and so I end up tying the shoe string pulls around the base of the bonnet twice and then tying it up.</li>
            <li> I would stuff a towel under the base of the bonnet to catch the air at that location</li>
            <li> (That would be annoying)  </li>
            <li> I hate it  Sitting here trying to get the hose out of the case</li>
            <li> The plastic hood is sized by a pull tie, and the scrunched plastic is annoying at the hairline.</li>
            <li> I hate this dryer.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed!</li>

            <li> The worst is not guarantee at all.</li>
            <li> I would have to wash it out and restyle because it looked horrible by day 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li> and they used to be TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> The tube on the hair dryer is very annoying.  </li>

            <li> My curls look terrible.  </li>
            <li> Works well but the chemical plastic smell is awful.</li>

            <li> Girlfriend purchased this on my account. Used it twice before the dryer broke. Gave two stars because she still uses the hat with her old dryer.</li>
            <li> good but hose is short</li>
            <li> This is a great product me and my girls love it!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this and the plastic smell is so overpowering I actually cannot use it.  I am going to give it a little time to air out and try again but it&#x27;s not looking good...</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer maybe a week now. It is very convenient and as comfortable as can be expected from a soft bonnet dryer. My only recommendation is that the hose be longer so that the dryer could sit on the floor as opposed to on my lap or bed. The hose is a decent length, maybe 24 inches? The settings are good. The high is definitely high. I will normally use high first just to get the dryer warmed up then once I feel that it is getting too hot I turn it to medium. My main use for this dryer is deep conditioning. All in all it is a good dryer so far and the price is good. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good hair dryer compact and a great joy to use</li>
            <li> Bought this to deep condition my hair every couple of weeks.  On the plus side, it does heat well and the adjustable heat settings are nice.  However, on the negative side, the bonnet tends to easily detach from the hose while using it.  Also, the the narrow base means it&#x27;s easy to tip it over and, during operation, the thing actually &amp;#34;travels&amp;#34; on the counter (due to the vibrations caused while operating) and frequently falls over.  The hose is also a bit short.  In summary, it works but the design issues do not make it pleasurable to use.</li>
            <li> As a natural red head with long, thick, unmanageable curls this product is now my lifeline. I had been straightening my curls out for the last 10 yrs as the only way to control the friz. I decided to try this product and I have been able to have my curls without any friz, even when the humidity rose during the day. I put the bonnet on for 15 min, on high. That&#x27;s all it takes for towel dried hair of my thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall is that the cord is not very long so you must be sitting within a few feet from the outlet.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t ever dry my hair completely even when I spend 1.5 hrs under this thing.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say yes, the motor blew yesterday and I haven&#x27;t even had it 6 mos..love the product but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Its got a convenient size, good heat.  Only that I would have preferred the black bonnet (how it was in the picture I saw), but received it with a white bonnet.  Still, it is quite good.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer on 4/11 and received it the next day (which is awesome by the way). I opened the box the same day and everything was packaged beautifully. However, I went to use the product this morning to dry my hair after washing it. I set it up on the counter and attached the hose, turning it on and it made a noise like it was going to heat up and it died!!! Never to come on again. I am glad that Amazon has a great return policy but very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t actually get to use the product.</li>
            <li> A little giant, compact, heats great, took in my Mediterranean cruise and it worked fine, it can be moved easily, I can work comfortably while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the hose...had to find alternative ways to use this...its okay...I would not recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> This dryer is my best friend! Very compact, easy to store and powerful. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> good quality. only problem you have to tie the string around cause when you turn it on high it will blow the bonnet back a little if u put it on high. for locks start on high them as time progresses put it on low heat as it dries well but takes time especially if ur locs are 3 yrs and older and if they are denser. ;) try it.</li>
            <li> i am really enjoying my tonic soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  I would have given it 5 stars, however, the bonnet is so large, I have to hold it the entire time I&#x27;m drying my hair and that is a real big inconvenience for me.</li>
            <li> I returned this dryer. It is too loud and I didn&#x27;t like the design. Can&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine BUT, it is VERY, VERY loud. It sounds like the vacuum at a car wash. It is also uncomfortable to wear. The cord is too heavy.  I would like to return it, but I&#x27;m not going to the trouble. In my experience, it is very difficult to get a refund on Amazon as they do not have a direct email or phone #.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, works well, fits a bit funny.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift; she said it works great and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot but dried my hair just fine. I would definitely keep a towel handy just in case your ears start burning. Also, the bonnet worked fine for me but I can understand why some people find it too big.</li>
            <li> Brand new in the box perfect thanks.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this, especially for the price. It provides a nice variety in settings, blows evenly, and stores everything away in little compartments. What more could you ask, especially at this price? I&#x27;m doing my own henna hair color at home to save time and $, so this dryer is key to getting the color to bond to the hair. Paid for itself in one skipped salon visit, plus it&#x27;s a more gentle heat (on low) than the one at the salon. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  workd great and I just love the big white cap.</li>
            <li> The reasons - Not enough instructions where the parts are stored. The tube is rather short. I use large rollers but the bonnet was very hard to accommodate over the head. By the time I got it on most rollers fell off. I like Laila Ali products but not this one. I gave it to a little girl I know.</li>
            <li> I just received my dryer and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. Right off, I noticed the hose does not stay securely in the bonnet. I put it in several times and turned it and as soon as I turn the dryer on, it moves back to the insert position and falls out. The other problem is, if I place the hose at the back of my head, the hair in the front gets less heat. So, I am stuck trying to dry my hair in the front by turning the bonnet around backwards. I hope the hose doesn&#x27;t burn my face.</li>
            <li> I love this.....dries my hair in minimum time; I have relaxed shoulder length hair not very thick. I use medium heat which is very hot so never had to switch to high heat.&lt;br /&gt;I look like I stepped out of the hair salon when I&#x27;m done....one of my best purchases yet</li>
            <li> Hair dry heats up good.  Can only use medium heat.  High is to hot.  Only problem is that the motor is very loud.</li>
            <li> This Hair dryer was a great investment.  It dries my hair so quickly and the soft bonnet is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Sent back strap broke first time I used it</li>
            <li> Wanted a bonnet hairdryer to use for &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; my hair...Overall, this seemed well-made, but the pullcord for tightening the bonnet didn&#x27;t work well for securing the bonnet around my head...I sent it back.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is poor, very cheap plastic, loud motor, and drying time is slow.  The tube that attaches to the bonnet is tricky as you are doing it behind your head and if it rotates it might fall off.  I wish I had spent more money and bought a better product.  It seems to me that there is a lot of profit being made on this item because it delivers so little to the consumer.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this dryer.  Has a variety of speeds and heat settings.  All the attachments (hood, hose, electrical cord) fit inside the case, making it neat and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Heats up well.</li>
            <li> The dryer worked well but the other parts were disappointing. The bonnet&#x27;s opening was too tight to fit over my hair without messing it up. The air hose was difficult to keep attached to the bonnet and was uncomfortably short. And, the part on the hose end that connects it to the bonnet seemed like cheap plastic that might break. Over all the dryer was unwieldy to use, and I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I waited until it was on sale and bought it. I really like how the attachments has their own space. The only thing I don&#x27;t like , I find that the dryer is to loud for my comfort. I owned this type of hair dryer before and it was a quiet.(a different brand) great product but it is too noisy for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eyed various hair bonnet driers due to the fact that my hair is thick and natural and takes forever to air dry. After dealing with frizzy twist/braid outs due to my hair not being completely dry in the morning, I decided to jump the threshold and purchase this dryer. This is one of the best purchasing decisions I made thus far on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual unit is small, easy on the eyes, and hosts very convenient packing spaces for the cord, bonnet, and actual connection. The fact that it takes less than a minute to set it up and pack it away without any hassle is a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries your hair fairly quickly once you figure out how to use the hot and cool settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for those who want to quickly dry up their styles or deep condition treatments. I am very happy that I purchased this dryer.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Unfortunately I returned it and went with one I found at Sally.</li>
            <li> I love it perfect for hair treatments, easy to use</li>
            <li> It heats up wonderfully, but the hose keeps popping off.  That gets really annoying.  I am going to have to attach it permanently, which means I will no longer be able to store it.  The case does not open.  The hose, bonnet and cord are stuffed into the end of the unit. Awkward.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, naturally curly, takes-forever-to-dry hair. I wanted something that would allow me to sit at computer or watch TV while I wait for my hair to dry - even with a dryer it takes a long time. This item is perfect. It seems to be good quality and solid construction. Everything fits compactly in the case for storage, and it is easy to place back in the case - it is not one of those that never quite go back  the way it was. Just be sure to fold the bonnet neatly and compactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two settings buttons - speed and temp. The speed can be set to low or high, the temp cool or warm (this button also has an off position so it doubles as the power button). The description says three settings...I am unsure what this means. As I stated, there are two settings for each control. This provides four possible combinations...low/cool, low/warm, high/cool, high/warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use large clips to secure my curls while drying. The bonnet fits over these clips and has plenty of room - will work well for larger rollers. It works fine over loose unclipped/unrolled hair as well. I generally use the low/cool setting. The bonnet stays in place just by pulling the strings tight and it does not get too hot. When I use the high setting, the bonnet does shift from the air pressure, but will stay in place if I actually tie the strings instead of just pulling them tight - or if I just lightly hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the warm setting, the hose gets hot, but it is not uncomfortable and it might be nice in the winter to have the warm hose on my arm. :) The hose connects to the bonnet a little higher up so it does not rest on my neck at all. I have no problem with burning on the neck regardless of temp setting on dryer.  I am fairly tall at 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;, but the hose is long enough that I can set the case next to me on the chair and it reaches the bonnet easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the dryer makes noise, but I am easily able to watch TV or video on mobile device and I can hear it without any problem. I just make sure the bonnet is not covering my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s everything. I am very happy with this item and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, gets hot and my very thick shoulder length hair dries quickly, probably 20-30 minutes on high. I used to have a hooded dryer which took over an hour to dry my hair.  Plus this dryer takes up less space and is a pretty purple color.  It&#x27;s loud, but I think that&#x27;s common.  My only problem is the hose, and it&#x27;s annoying enough to take off 2 stars. The hose attaches to the bonnet by matching the notches in the hose to the notches in the bonnet and then giving it a quarter turn to lock. However it does not stay locked. If I turn my head the hose comes loose 80% of the time. I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective or if they all have this issue. But if the hose locked I would give this dryer 5 stars. Even with that issue, I would probably buy it again because it dries my hair well and that&#x27;s why I bought it, after all. :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Good for deep conditioning, rollersets. Very well made.  Durable. The compact dryer is very convenient and easy to store away.</li>
            <li> The bonnet cap is huge and it dries very quickly. My hair is long and course thick hair but it works well</li>
            <li> even though it worked well the first time, the second time i tried to use it strange sounds and smell came out.  the machine did not seem to run properly as it went on and then stopped and then started again all on its own.  the whole room smelled of burnt iron so i stopped using it.  i would not recommend it for anyone else to buy.  i am now in the process of returning it back to amazon so that i get a refund.</li>
            <li> Dryer gets hot but the tubing where the heat goes through is too hot for the neck area because it falls on the neck and shoulder area. The product dries the hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered hair dryer two times. Both times it had been used, scratched and damaged. I give up. Will return and not order again. Ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li> Have taken this on trips and after a day at the beach or pool, I can still go to dinner with my hair looking fab! :-)  It is light-weight and so far, I have had it for 2 years with no problems. Great for wrap and go, curlers, deep conditioning. The ONLY THING is that the strings do not tie on as tightly, and I wish they would change this. However, since I wrap my hair, the knots from the paper keep it in place.  Would probably be the same for curlers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December and it worked good for a while but now that cap has become detached from the tube and it does not seem that there is a way to fix it. I can&#x27;t return it now and it does not seem like there is an option to have the cap replaced or to even contact the seller directly to see if they would be willing to help in anyway.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair and it dries in an hour. Love it</li>
            <li> I works well, nice and portable and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> First time using it was great ....... excellent for hair drying straighten hair. Love the color and everything. Thank you Laila Ali for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my Granny she kept asking for a dryer so I found it &amp; she literally loves it.. Its the best thing since sliced bread...</li>
            <li> I mainly use this hair dryer when i apply deep conditions to my hair and its great. I have the hot cold high and low settings which is all you really need and your not trapped under thos big bulky dryers unable to move. i can still move around with this dryer since its sort of like a huge hat. Its easy to clean and easy to put away. Love the little case it comes in as well!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!  After the 3rd use, the hose to the bonnet broke loose from up inside the dryer and now it&#x27;s totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few extra dollars and get a real hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Very, very noisy.  And I mean noisy.  Also where they bonnet connects to the hose this fit is so loose the hose fall off the bonnet all the time. Poor product overall.</li>
            <li> Poor quality bonnet and hose connection.  The bonnet/hose connection would not stay connected within the first couple months of owning this hair dryer.  Not sure why, because I put it on and sit in one place.  Also, could not find a way to get in touch with the mftr to request a new hose fitting.  Soon after, the bonnet began ripping around the hose connector part.&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning, it was a struggle to find a way to let the bonnet rest comfortably without the hot air and/or the hose being way too hot near whatever part of my body it came into contact with: ears, shoulders, forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Just an overall hassle from day one out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Like it but the bonnet ends to not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Once you are able to hold a pose where the tube piece does not come out of the cap, you will get the results you need.  However, it is very frustrating to use when the tube keep falling out of the cap.  The tube is not long enough to support it staying on the cap.  I would not recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used it once, doesn&#x27;t seem to heat properly.</li>
            <li> Great dryer and love its portability, but i wish the hose was longer. Also the hit setting is exactly that...probably a lil too hot!</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer.  I have very thick curly long hair. I twist and wrap it up to dry it. Takes about an hour to dry. The bonnet is large enough and comfortable. You can choose from multiple heat settings.  A small towel wrapped around back of neck for the high setting is a good idea.  It is great to be able to read or go on computer while drying.  It is a bit noisy so watching TV is difficult unless you are alone and can turn volume way up.  Using subtitles works well too!  All in all I would recommend this dryer. It is fairly easy to set up...took me a while to get the hang of getting the hose in and out but everything easily fits right back in for easy storage. I have never owned a bonnet dryer but do find it easier than the old hood dryer I had.</li>
            <li> Works well for our braid-outs. I just purchased a second one so that my two daughters could get their hair dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom who is in her 70&#x27;s &amp; still uses rollers to set her hair. She loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> Feels like it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job! I use it for deep conditioning treatments. It might take some adjusting to stay on and it is sometimes really hot where the hose is. Those are minor things to deal with for the price and easiness. It also was well designed for storage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now. LOVE IT! GET IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall great product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. Pros: dries hair fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, is purple. Cons: too much movement causes the hose to disconnect from the bonnet and the extension cord isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> I actually like the dryer. I used it and it dried my hair very well. What I DIDN&#x27;T like is that Amazon apparently is selling two versions of this. The while one pictured and the black one from the video reviews. I ordered the white one, used it, asked Amazon to replace it with the black one and they sent me the while one AGAIN. I now have two and have to return the second one I got. I will just keep it and use it. Again it dried my hair well, but I wanted to try the black one as I had a similar Gold&#x27;N&#x27;Hot one and wanted to try it out. Other than that, this is a pretty good dryer and I would wear this any day over having to sit under a salon dryer type for over an hour. Also, High DOES get really hot. It was scorching my ears and I had to cover them with a towel, but I&#x27;m Dominican, I&#x27;m used to that lol. Anyways, I do like it. I will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I am a natural and needed a upright hair dryer.  This product is the bomb! (slg) This dryer is perfect for me because I natural and have low perosity hair (naturals will understand this).  I have very little time to nurture my hair so when I come home at night and have to do the routine I am a little discouraged because I know that the next morning my hair will still be wet.  Not with this product.  I was able to do a late routine, deep condition, style and still wake up with dry hair - hallelujah!  Furthermore, the product is lightweight, easy to carry and store and can be tucked away in a suitcase when you have to just go.  I absolutely love this dryer and very happy that I invested.  The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> This is very good but it can get really hot on the high settings and as one other review suggested, use the medium settings and you will be ok.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Really works when conditioning.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this at first, but found that it really works.  It&#x27;s not as loud as a blow dryer and was able to sit in my recliner and watch t.v while drying my hair.  I usually sit in a roller-set at the hairdresser for an hour.  But I wanted the flexibility to do it myself if needed.  You will need to protect your ears and neck from the high heat.  I used high setting for about 40 minutes and hair was almost dry.  When I un-twisted my braids, some parts were damp and I went back under for another 15 minutes.  I have shoulder length (to about underarm)  color-treated hair but with no relaxer (some refer to this as natural black hair). I&#x27;ve only used it once, and hope it holds up for future uses.  The container does not get warm either....</li>
            <li> This dries great and fun.  It takes me back to junior high.  The only issue is the hose and cord are not long so you have to have machine so close to you and positioned just so.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT!  I purchased the Laila Ali Soft Bonnet Dryer after reading some reviews, and viewing a video.  Well, it was&#x27;t until after I received the dryer that I realized the video posted for THIS product, is actually for the other Ali dryer. Great.  Since I now have it, I thought I&#x27;d use it.  WELL, my first order of disgust was to discover the bonnet does not have a drawstring.  Instead it&#x27;s a tight cap with elastic so when I attempted to pull it over my large rollers, half of them popped out, fell out of the clips or just collapsed to the floor....SO ANGRY.  I salvaged what I could then went to the next step.  I then attempted to connect the hose to the bonnet, since it would take a cirque de soleil contortionist to struggle with the tight bonnet WHILE it&#x27;s connected to the unit.  Didn&#x27;t matter.  My proactive idea to connect after was futile because after five minutes of feeling around blindly to connect the hose, I did so, only for it to come out when I sat down to dry.  Arrrrgh!  It&#x27;s true what others have said, put a towel around your neck or feel the burn.  Also, the side where the on/off and settings are, is the same side as the hose which makes for a oddly placed and difficult to navigate activity.  This will be my only time using this thing.  I urge you to search around.  I just purchased another one from Amazon.  Will get it next week, hopes the new one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time opening it because I expected the latch to be at the top of the case (the way all other latches of this type have been). Finally, I saw that the latch was at the bottom of the case (bottom when it is standing up like a case with a handle). It would be nice if they were more explicit about this in the instructions. I will review again after using it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer.  It is is compact and lightweight -- I take it on business trips -- and it is still powerful.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is as described. It only really dries one side of my hair at a time. The air comes out of the bottom and is usually unbearable on my neck but that&#x27;s easily remedied by wearing a scarf when using this dryer. I *struggled* to get the bonnet to fit over a head full of rods. After I was able to cover my head, it only partially dried my hair and then it was time to take off the bonnet and reposition. After the effort it took to get it on the first time, I just gave up and held the hose and pointed it at my head. I&#x27;m buying a hard hooded dryer as a replacement for this one. This works and is convenient if you&#x27;re on the go or traveling but it just can&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product.  The hose continuously disconnects and it feels like the heat concentrates on one side of my head.  It&#x27;s okay but I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIS</li>
            <li> I have used it about 3 times and I&#x27;m very impressed. It gets very hot immediately and does an excellent job. It&#x27;s light, easy to use and worth the price. The only con is the storage area for the cord and bonnet, it&#x27;s very tight. Not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago.  I probably just never give any product top stars,  but I have nothing negative to say about this product.  It&#x27;s very hot,  the bonnet is large for big rollers.  I love the portable convenience of it,  so I can sit on my bed and use it. It has a high and low fan setting and a hot and cool settings.  Worth the $$$$. No regrets.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer works really well....</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! and loved the price. I got the merchandise quickly with no problems. I have really LONG CURLY HAIR and it worked BETTER than I expected... Definetely recomend the product</li>
            <li> Puts out a lot of heat and fits over all my hair with a butterfly clip, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Gets extremely hot on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! I have pretty long extensions&lt;br /&gt;22&amp;#34; and it dries my hair in 35 minutes I use to pay 50$ at the salon every week this thing is a pocket and life saver best of all u can take it evey where Bc it looks like a suitcase at first I was like where&#x27;s everything ! How am I suppose to dry my hair I don&#x27;t think is gonna give enough heat to dry this long hair well I put this thing on high and lord have mercy it was HOT! Then I put it in medium it was still super hot til I put it down to low long story short ladies ! It&#x27;s worth the money ! It dries UR hair pretty good and in no time :)</li>
            <li> Good heat.  Good quality, but loud</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life.  This  is what I need for my natural hair.  Easy to use very compact.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very good and it actually gets hot...</li>
            <li> Malfunctioned on the first use</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair. I can only go 2 days without washing it- after that it just frizzes. I have been using a hairdryer with a diffuser for years- would get lazy and let it air dry halfway. Just got tired of not being able to do other things while I dried my hair. Used this for the first time today and I loved it! Only con is that the hose kept falling out. I used root clips for volume under the bonnet. It took 30 or 45 minutes to completely dry my hair. My curls look shorter because they were completely dried with a hairdryer, rather than limp from air drying. New favorite beauty product! Maybe I&#x27;ll tape the hose!</li>
            <li> This item has changed my life! I will love it forever... I wish that the hose locked into the cap with more security so I can easily move around... But aside from that, I give it a A!</li>
            <li> So I was so excited to get this cute bonnet hair dryer and to support Laila Ali, but I have to say I am disappointed. While the dryer looks nice it has some problems. It is very loud. I can&#x27;t not stress how loud and it is loud on every setting. The biggest issue for me is that it gets so hot that you need to put a towel or something around your neck. It also doesn&#x27;t have have much slack. I will try and sit on the couch and the outlet is right next to the couch and it barley reaches and will fall down if I move even slightly. It does get my hair dry, but I do not like it. I will continue to use it once or twice a month for a deep conditioning treatment but when it stops working I will be going back to Sally&#x27;s and purchasing another Gold N Hot. I had one that lasted me for 5 years and I used it weekly. I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not a good hair dryer.  The fan does not push much warm air to dry the top and sides of hair, so you end up with dry hair in the back and wet hair on the top and sides.  Also when the dryer heats up the hose that connects to the bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay hooked.  Then when you go to put the hose back in the case, you have to fight with it to fit in.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use. I just wish the hood fit a little better. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great and I love it!</li>
            <li> Yes this dryer exceeds my expectations.. Gets extremely hot on medium setting.. Works well with my 2 inch magnetic rollers..Dry hair at a fast pace and wondeful for my 20-30 min deep conditioning treatments.. As for sound.. Yes it&#x27;s a little loud.. But, I just pop in my earbuds and watch Netflix on my iPad.. :-)..Love it.. Glad I made the purchase..</li>
            <li> I certainly appreciate the great quality in this product. Everything about it is strong and sturdy and built to last. I love the convince of being able to move about while watching tv or reading a book etc. It easily fits under the cabinet or under the bed. I Love it and use it to dry my twist/braid out styles. It can be used to accelerate deep conditioning too. Although I have a steamer for that purpose I would certainly be able to use this as well. The price was right. I went to sallys to price them. Amazon beats the competition and also free shipping too!! can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> Works well with my deep conditioning and roller setting. I wish it would stay on better but I kept it tied down with a scarf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful, compact, comfortable (considering what it is) and exactly what I hoped it would be. An improvement on the ones I had as a teenager, but does the job I need it to do -- get my jumbo curlers under wraps and dried in record time.</li>
            <li> The reason this is 4 stars, is because this can be actually dangerous as far as burning you on the hose and cap, not from the air on the hair.  I use this on my 85 yr old mother.  I realized quickly that after just a few minutes of use on Medium setting, that the cap was poofed and bent down on my mother&#x27;s neck and left red burn marks across her entire exposed neck.  I was upset of course and used the sunburn ointments the rest of the day.  The Hose also is very hot and if draped across the body will leave red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to still use this by putting thin wash cloths across my mothers ears and draping a towel over both ears and along the entire area of her neck and down her back (double layered), and it prevented any further problem.  I keep the towels wrapped with the dryer to prevent forgetting to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the mechanics of it, it does blow air well and does heat up for use.  The hose and electric cord both push back into the carry motor which is really nice.  Most importantly, my mom LOVES purple!  Very compact and light weight</li>
            <li> Works well, but I wish the hose and electrical cord were longer.</li>
            <li> this dryer has come in handy. it works perfectly every time I use it to deep condition my hair. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews for various hair dryers before purchasing this one. I was worried about the size of the bonnet given the other reviews I read. But the dryer works perfectly. The bonnet could be tightened and fit well for both my larger head and lots of hair, and my mother&#x27;s smaller head and shorter, thinner hair. The heat was fine, the low setting gets the job done, we&#x27;ve tried the high setting too, and that works too. We did use a towel behind the neck just in case it got too hot, but it never felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom. The bonnet was a little big ,but adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;She is 82 and just loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I wish I could of given this 0  stars.  The cap barely fits  tied at its tightest and it still comes off as soon as you turn on the dryer.  If the cap doesn&#x27;t come off then the house pops off the back and you are having to hold  it in place  which by the way burns your hands.  Not worth it for a  deep conditioner.  I am definitely sending it back. very very very very very disappointed and disgusted  with this product.  You&#x27;re  better off getting the cordless  turban.</li>
            <li> works well I like it better that air drying my hair</li>
            <li> I love it, it drys your hair quickly and it is portable. What else could you want.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use but did the job</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer is so handy especially when doing a hot oil treatment it braid out. Easy to assemble not to noisy and it get really hot so be careful. The bonnet is really big to fit different size head or styles &amp;#34;hair rollers&amp;#34;. I find it better to put the hose part to the side in stead of the back so that the heat wouldn&#x27;t burn your neck.</li>
            <li> So I have been new to maintaining my own hair instead of going to the hair salon. Buying this product was one of my first and BEST investments. I read the other reviews where people are saying that the hose disconnects while in use and I have not had this happen to me. This dryer gets so HOT that I had to turn down the heat which was SUPER IMPRESSIVE. Its very convenient, light weight, easy to use and well worth the price. This is definitely a HOT BUY (literally) and I would buy it again. Actually my daughter saw me using it and said how cool it was, so I will be purchasing another for her!!! Its just my opinion but this dryer works for me.</li>
            <li> Please note that the review videos shown are for a different model. One with a different bonnet.  The bonnet that comes with this dryer is too small and I am unable to fit it over all the curlers without messing up the set.</li>
            <li> This is a great portable unit.  The bonnet is so roomy and easy to store.  It heats very well and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great portable hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I like the dryer but when the cap fills with warm air it will not stay in place.  It rides up so that I have to keep pulling it down to keep it over my hair.  This kind of defeats the purpose of being able to do something else, such as read a book, while the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair with a mind of its own.  When I want to look sleeker I set my hair on rollers.  When I want the natural look I scrunch my curls with curly hair product and let it have its way.  This dryer is perfect for either style and dries my hair in about 45 minutes.  For me that is a fast dry.  The highest setting is not too hot and the packaging is wonderfully compact.  Could not be happier with it.  And the price is totally reasonable.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best hair dryer I have used.&lt;br /&gt; I use it with 1&amp;#34; rollers and it takes about 30 min to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remove the rollers immediately just let it cool completely for 10-15 min then brush your hair with thick hair brush.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets too hot (even on the medium setting)  where the hose enters the bonnet and does not distribute the heat around to the front. I damaged my hair after two uses.  Otherwise, the design is great and compact.</li>
            <li> The power that this machine has in unbelievable! I use it under large rollers and, in fifteen minutes my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect dryer bonnet out there. The pros of this one are that it has multiple heat settings and if you can keep it on it seems to work well. It&#x27;s also nice that it can be so compact when you&#x27;re putting it away. The cons are the hose keeps falling out of the cap, the bonnet doesn&#x27;t fit quite so well but manageable, and it&#x27;s very loud, much louder than I expected. I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain so much about the loudness though because of the regular blow dryer handheld is loud as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets a little hot though but nothing you can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> So happy with this bonnet hair dryer! Been eying it for years now. I use jumbo rollers to straighten my hair and get lots of volume. This works great for that!! Bonnet was a little tight the first time I used it. Nearly pulled off all of my rollers just trying to get it on. Didn&#x27;t have any isises with lifting while the dryer was on. It did get pretty darn hot around where the hose attaches. So you may have to put a TShirt or towel around your neck to help deal with the heat but other then that I would highly recommend this! My hair is so much healthier already since now I don&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair to wear it straight!</li>
            <li> Not Fantastic but Okay&lt;br /&gt;Worked OK but took longer to dry than my older bonnet dryer from the 1980&#x27;s. Needs more air volume.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star but the Bonnet is not big enough for my jumbo rollers, it fits but barely and because of that the air doesn&#x27;t distribute as well to the front, so I have to switch the hose to the front for at least 20 min. But I use jumbo rollers on my whole head so this most likely wont be the case for everyone. Also the hose is a bit short but still good to work with. Other than that, truly amazing. VERY hot which is perfect for my long thick hair, very compact and portable, the bonnet distributes the heat very evenly and it&#x27;s cut down my drying time in half. I truly recommend it, it&#x27;s been a life saver. Also got the package a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Love it I can dry my hair and watch tv without straining my neck.  Great purchase worth the money I paid</li>
            <li> It requires me to sit under the dryer less than half the time of my old dryer. Everything stores very conveniently  and the temperature settings are perfect. I tried it on my 9 year old and the hot setting was too hot but the the cool setting was just right. The bag was a little big for her head though but we made it work. I definitely recommend this dryer, it is all I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t circulate well. All of the heat is centered where the hose connects the cap. It&#x27;s gets really hot back there too</li>
            <li> I just received this today. Two day shipping was fast and on time. This is probably one of the cutest soft bonnet dryers i have seen. If you have a small head beware, this bonnet is HUGE! Its for a person with really long hair or a big head person with jumbo rollers. Luckily i have a big head and lots of hair. I have not used it yet thats why i gave it 5 stars. I will write an update when i do.</li>
            <li> Loved the compact size of this dryer. It gets pretty hot and fits over just about any style.  The elastic gathered in the front was a bit uncomfortable otherwise a perfect item.</li>
            <li> This dryer is the worst.  I was using it today to dry my hair on high.  Can you believe the hose melted and fell right off.  It didn&#x27;t even last a year. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> The hose detaches itself from the bonnet quiet easily. The bonnet is a tad uncomfortable. The cord is short. When using, you have to be sure that you have nothing else to do but sit there.  Not as hot as I would like but it serves it purpose well which is to heat your hair.</li>
            <li> After placing my order it arrived in two days. The color  is beautiful. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times. The dryer has 3 setting low, medium, high. I use the medium setting and it&#x27;s pretty hot. The high setting can be used for about 15 mins. after that it gets too hot for me. I love that you can use it while laying down relaxing. The dryer is very compact. You can not go wrong with this dryer. It will dry your hair completely and fast and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it! It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable and efficient! Plus I like that its a Laila Ali product. I do admire her.</li>
            <li> I have owned the dryer for just over 2 months and the plastic bonnet has come apart.  I have had to spend time looking on the internet for a replacement.  Like the idea of a hair dryer, dries well in a short space of time.  Don&#x27;t like that I will have to replace the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I use this every week to deep condition my hair. I have used it to steam my hair, silk wrap, and rollar sets.  The high heat setting gets very hot. But I find if I wrap or hold a towel over my ears it does help (a little). I am very glad that I bought this. I have had it for four months and I think it has made a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> great product huge adjustable bonnet, worth the price that I paid for it. I would definitely recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> Gave the dryer as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The person who used it said it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;They were extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer - dries my thick hair very fast.  I just put a towel around my neck to keep the hot hose from touching it and I&#x27;m good.  Love the portability of it - great for traveling. It is pretty lightweight, though, so be careful where you place it when using it.  One quick turn of your head and it could easily fall.</li>
            <li> It a good product.  The only thing is the flex hose is too short.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> This is not the model that I purchased in 2013 so my review has changed.  The one I purchased was in the flat case and it was purple and black.  The nozzle that fits inside the dryer has since torn due to heat.  The nozzle was so tight in the area were the heat comes from it could not be replaced.  Apparently with this model the nozzle can be replaced if torn due to excessive heat or wear and tear,</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I have a terrible experience since day one. First time the dryer didn&#x27;t want to turn off while it was hot and no even since months later the plastic ring that goes in the cap is completely detach so I can&#x27;t use it at all. The worst is not guarantee at all. Not company to call. Don&#x27;t waist your money and get something with a company that offers guarantee</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Cord does get hot when heat is on high. I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> I was sold by all the great reviews of this item but I just tried to use it for te first time and it started smelling of burnt plastic. Afraid of starting a fire, I turned it off and to say I&#x27;m disappointed would be an understatement :(</li>
            <li> I must say that this hair dryer has truly proven to be worth the money. The fact that I can sit on the couch or in my lounge chair while drying my hair is a plus in itself. No more sitting at the kitchen table under one of those super hot old school hair dryers.    The dryer hair bag is super huge and provides heat throughout my entire head / hair. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to find a comfortable position to sit in using my hard cover dryer and decided to try this. This dryer is much more efficient, heat doesn&#x27;t escape into the air, all of the heat is directed to my hair. Takes less time to dry, even on the medium setting(with hard cover I always needed to use the high heat setting) and I have pretty thick hair. Most importantly, I can sit where ever I want to sit. So comfortable and efficient. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I won&#x27;t ever be without one again..</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. It took me a while to figure out how to put it all together, and I do wish the cord to plug into the wall were longer.</li>
            <li> Works great! I prefer to let my hair air dry a bit before use to limit my dryer time. Medium setting is perfect, switch to cool a bit before disconnecting and you have perfect hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who wanted a lightweight bonnet style hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t know the dryer was unsafe. The description did not show there was no safety device on the cord. It is possible to receive an electrical shock from this device if it isn&#x27;t plugged into a GFCI receptacle.</li>
            <li> It heats very quick and overall is a great product. Wish the hair bonnet was bigger so it can fit jumbo rollers. Other than that, I will recomend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with high hopes that it would be a great replacement for my broken dryer. Wrong! I love that it is compact, but the bonnet is a no-no. It doesn&#x27;t fit at all!! The bonnet kept flying off of my head each time I turned the dryer on and the strings to adjust the tightness of the bonnet left much to be desired. After tightening it to it&#x27;s limit, it still didn&#x27;t fit. The item was returned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Xmas gift and the button to turn it on low or high doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m penalized for buying a Xmas gift early because it&#x27;s to late to return it. The switch doesn&#x27;t allow you to click from low to high. This is a manufacture error and someone should have caught this. Now my 17yr old is disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  I use it with a plastic cap for deep conditioning and it does a great job.  I also use it with curlers.  I can fit a full head of bouffant (large) curlers in the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 4 settings: cool, low, medium, and high.  (Cool has no heat.)  I only use it either on cool or low.  Low is warm enough to dry my hair gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud, but no louder than you&#x27;d expect a hair dryer to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the deep purple color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet, hose, and power cord all fit in the case for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 reasons that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I wish the hose was longer.  It is only 29 inches long.  I have to sit it right next to me to have it reach to my head with a little bit of slack left over. (I&#x27;d like to be able to put it on the floor so I can do work at the computer or other things while using it.)&lt;br /&gt;2.  The case tends to fall over when you stand it on the narrow edge.</li>
            <li> it was everything I was expecting. when I have on a curler set and I need them to dry I slip it on and my hair is dry within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head when I use the really big jumbo rollers so I will have to use the regular large ones</li>
            <li> Awesome product..  it dries really well and it is so easy to store.  All of the attachments store inside of the actual heating unit.  It is also lightweight and easy to carry due to the built in handle.  Really nice product.</li>
            <li> It kinda works kinda doesn&#x27;t. My experience was that the bonnet was too slack at the bottom so air just escaped.</li>
            <li> I love the way the bonnet look and the compactness of it, After 3 uses some parts of my hair is not getting the heat and I have to keep spinning the bonnet around on my head to get all parts of my hair to get in contact with the heat.  To me, the low is too low and medium is not hot enough and hot is way too hot.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what&#x27;s the policy is with returns, but am going to return it once there&#x27;s no restocking fee:(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad because I really lone the color of the bonnet.  One more thing, The cord that contact to the bonnet kept falling off although I head a clicking sound when I attach it.  Not sure if i&#x27;ll recommend this bonnet.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these items. One of them was a gift and the person liked it so much I bought one for myself. Mine continues to work fine but the person I gave this to as a gift was not as fortunate. The area where the hose attaches to the bonnet became so loose that it no long connects. Not sure if replacing the cap will solve the problem but it is unfortunate that this item did not even last a year.</li>
            <li> Cool is warm.  Hot is really hot, and cool is about right, but that leaves us with no cool.  I need that to cool the rollers off and set the curl, but alas, not from this device.  I even tried running it on cool when the dryer itself was cool, thinking it was the stored heat in the tube and cap that was heating it up, but no... turn on a cold dryer to cool and you get WARM.</li>
            <li> Upon the first time using the dryer it only worked for about 45 seconds, then it shut down completely. I waited until the next day to try again and it still wouldn&#x27;t work. So I&#x27;m returning it totally dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It is hot but does not blow enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase this dryer.  It is just like the ones I grew up with as a child.  I have should length relaxed hair.  It takes about 45 minutes on the medium setting and a little over an hour on the low setting.  The plastic tubing can get a bit warm on your neck, however, I put a towel between the tubing and my skin.  It was easy to assemble. Very easy to disassemble.  Stores very nicely.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very good at drying but at times it can burn. Overall, very nice resullts.</li>
            <li> Works great ,compact thanks so much, Debi</li>
            <li> Get pretty hot but that&#x27;s what its suppose to do...</li>
            <li> She use it even though the cap is a little had for her but it does do the job.  It was good to finally find a bonnet type for her.  She needed light weight and small.</li>
            <li> The hose is a little short, had to turn bonnet sideways so it would reach even though the hairdryer was on the table right next to me.  This model only had one dial,  low was plenty warm.  It is loud to the person wearing it.  The hose pushes back up into its hole.  There is a little door that opens for the cord and to store the bonnet.  Afraid to carry it by the handle as it looks so flimsy.  Did a good job.  Easy to store, nice compact shape.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Powerful dryer, but the cord does not stay attached to the bonnet. It&#x27;s a constant to struggle dry my hair when I have to hold the cord in with my hand to keep it in the bonnet!!</li>
            <li> I do like the new design, as opposed to the old briefcase model. However, I will note that getting the hose back in it&#x27;s little cave can be difficult.  Other than that, this dryer is definitely a winner. Makes deep conditioning a breeze. The heat evenly flows throughout the bonnet onto my whole head. I haven&#x27;t needed to use it above the low setting.</li>
            <li> This really works, dries my hair fast because it gets really hot.  I find that I have to cover the back of my neck if I am under the dryer for over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Stores well.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was properly packaged. The hose does get hot when on high so make sure you cover your back with something or you will get burned. Overall it is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this dryer! I really purchased this dryer for my 9 year old daughter that had such a hard time sitting under a hooded dryer. She complained about the back of her neck and ears getting too hot. When feeling her hair under the hooded dryer while deep conditioning,  only the top of her head would be hot.  So a friend told me about Laila Ali&#x27;s dryer and I decided to give it a try. This dryer is made very well! The bonnet provides plenty of room and your hair is heated evenly while the bonnet is on. I tried it myself and love it. I layed in the bed and watched a movie while my hair way drying! Comes in a super cute case and very easily stored! Laila has a customer for life!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am natural &amp; use this to do twist outs when I don&#x27;t have much time... Dries quicker than usual 2-4 hours! Last time I used it ( I think my hair dried in 45 mintues).  I love this thang &amp; would recommend this to any thicked haired girl in the world :)</li>
            <li> I just received  my beautiful Laila Ali LADR5604 Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer, Purple and Black today(3/22/14) and i&#x27;m completely blown away at how my hair felt after just 15 mins of use. I used it on the cool/low setting and my hair is sooo amazingly silky soft. I&#x27;m super happy with this product. I would recommend this product :) i have not had any problems yet. (knocks on wood) but after researching and researching this, only use i read is that if you put it on HOT and High have a towel wrapped around your neck. So, for that only being the minus on the product i&#x27;d say this is a must get. GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Motor died and totally stopped working within 2 months after purchasing. I only used it about 8 times. Amazon only allows returns or exchanges within 30 days, so all I can do is throw it out and accept the money loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, those 8 times I used it hair was left shiny and smooth. Really wish it would have survived longer.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s great for when you want to deep condition your hair or you want your hair to dry faster. I have kinky 3c/4a hair and it&#x27;s great to use when my twist/braid outs from the night before still aren&#x27;t dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positioning of the holes can get a little hot after a while if you use the hot setting, but nothing a little adjusting can&#x27;t fix. I also don&#x27;t really like how close the holes are to your actual hair so there could be potential heat damage because the hot air is directly going on your strands, but you could always put a plastic cap as a small buffer I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, it&#x27;s to be expected because of the price. Overall this product is really great, if you are not a professional hairdresser but want a hairdryer at home I would strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I ordered the model whose case opened and has a different bonnet. The model I received was different. The hose it attached and pulls from the side of the unit. The bonnets and power plug are tucked away through a separate access panel on the side of the unit. The bonnet design allows for adjustments for smaller or larger heads. There are 3 heat setting, low, medium and high. there is also a cool setting. the setting all work as described. Love the upgraded unit. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer! I always have a hard time drying my hair with a regular dryer-my hair gets everywhere! This is great to use just out of the shower, put the cap on and proceed to get your face ready, etc. I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit with the jumbo rollers I purchased, but I was able to wear the bonnet with 18 jumbo curlers on my head. Plus the results were great a and all of my hair was dried.</li>
            <li> This dryer works! You can take it and use it anywhere. I have medium length hair and it drys it in an hour and 10 minutes.  I always wait a few extra minutes just to make sure my hair totally dry. Especially since I have very processed hair. But it leaves it shiny and smooth.  I also use it for deep treatments and hair color.  It really deserves 10 stars.  Go ahead and buy it.  Best money spent.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about 4/5 months and already the hose has twisted and about to tear off --- I really did like this dryer but DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> When I received the dryer yesterday, I was excited to try it out today. My hair is long, so I like to use large velcro curlers (the giant, pink Conair ones). I don&#x27;t use smaller curlers because I&#x27;m not really looking for curl so much as volume, and smaller ones just get tangled when I try to take them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the reviews mentioned the bonnet being very large - large enough to accommodate large curlers. I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case. Last night I opened the bonnet up and put it on my head without curlers, but today, with the large curlers I use, I found that the bonnet is quite tight on the sides of my head and is pressing the curlers into my scalp. It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable. I would have preferred more space for better air flow. The bonnet fits in a kind of mohawk or Portuguese man o&#x27;war (jellyfish) shape (tall at the middle of the top, short at the sides). I might try finagling the bonnet and wear it in a different direction to see if it&#x27;s more comfortable. Or maybe I just have a big head, and won&#x27;t be able to get the bonnet to fit with my huge curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside to this product, which is why I think this is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and not worth more than 3 stars is that the low setting doesn&#x27;t work. At all. Thankfully at least the high setting works, and it&#x27;s not too hot when the temp is set to hot. The cool setting is a little warmer than I&#x27;d like, but still cooler than hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was writing this review, I flipped the dryer to the low setting just to make sure I was correct that it wasn&#x27;t working. Then a little wisp of smoke floated across my face and I realized that something inside the motor was burning with the setting switched to low. So that&#x27;s that. I had qualms about returning or keeping this product as I want a bonnet dryer and this is nice that it takes up less space than a standing one. But I don&#x27;t need a fire hazard or something that seems perilously balanced on the brink of malfunctioning. If this dryer worked properly on all settings, I probably would have kept it.orked properly on all settings, I probably would have kept it.</li>
            <li> Bought as xmas for girlfriend (item on her wish-list). She love it. I still honestly have no idea what this thing does. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I like the lower wattage of this dryer, and the dual heat settings.  The high heat setting can occasionally be unpleasant on exposed skin (ears, neck, forehead). Excellent for roller sets. Bonnet does not close tightly enough for flat drying, IMO.</li>
            <li> Purchased for doing coconut oil treatments and home hair color. Have been very pleased with the quality and hot temp. Have to switch between hot and cool settings to stay comfortable so not good for someone with impaired sensations, could burn them. Nice large bonnet, stays in place with ties at chin and easily fits my hair in largest rollers. Very pleased. Hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blow dryer.  Got this to see how it would look if I actually used regular, old-fashioned rollers once in a while.  It worked.  Took longer than a blow dryer, of course.  I have very long hair.  I color my hair, and it&#x27;s probably very gray underneath.  Some people with gray hair find that the strands get frizzy when they go gray.  That reduces the shine.  Plus, treated hair isn&#x27;t very shiny anyway.  So, I had thought that putting the hair on rollers might straighten and shine-up those strands.  And maybe it did for about 15 minutes or so, but I live at the beach and the whole effect only lasted about 10 minutes after I removed the cap.  I didn&#x27;t even make it to the meeting without having the curly waves come back . . . and loss of shine.  So, it didn&#x27;t work on that count.  But if all you want is dry hair and you&#x27;re willing to sit still for 30 minutes or so, then -- why not!  Saves having to foof it up with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it, it got the job done. It did get a little hot and I had to put a towel under the plastic piece but other than that it did great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much since I haven&#x27;t been to the pool in awhile but when I return this is the best purchase I could have made.  My hair takes HOURS to dry and this dryer does the trick. Easy to use, lightweight, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works well,bonnet fits fine,not too big..Plenty hot enough for the deep conditioning that I bought it for. Easy to pack back up and store. Not too loud either.</li>
            <li> Old style but goodie.  Fabulous for conditioning hair and for curls.  Easy to move around the house with it.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very noisy, cheaply made, no power ..and the cap is small..I&#x27;m returning ..hopefully. I can&#x27;t believe Laila Ali would put her name on this product.</li>
            <li> I expected more. I was a little disappointed that the attachment was defective. I had to glue it properly in order to properly insert the hose. I guess manufacturing problem. Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t dry evenly. Perhaps I am not doing something right. However, I am happy with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it leaves it silky, smooth and shine so I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer; however, it requires some extra effort to make using it comfortable. The bonnet seems to be mostly designed for those who are doing huge roller sets. For people like me who just want to deep condition or dry hair without rollers, this bonnet is way too big. The drawstrings are useless when it comes to making it fit the head. Therefore, heat escapes from the perimeter and causes the ears and perimeter of the head to burn from the heat that is escaping from the bonnet (valuable heat that should be used for drying the hair!). I took the advice of another reviewer and tied a long scarf around the parameter of the bonnet; this kept the heat contained and made it fit (alternative to the drawstring feature). I also tied another scarf around the parameter of my head, covering ears, to prevent feeling the burn of the heat. I love the compactness and portability of this unit. Very easy to set up and take down!</li>
            <li> I have medium length natural hair.  I often wear natural hair weaves too.  This product works well with the huge flexi rods (purple/gray).  As most of the reviews state, you do have to play with the edges a bit as when on high it&#x27;s hot on your ears.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! Get&#x27;s nice and hot, dries my hair quickly. I have long locs, which usually take a while to dry, but this dryer gets them done in about an hour/1.5 hrs, which is really great for the amount of hair that I have. Also, the bonnet is quite large (roomy enough for all my hair) and the drawstring in addition to the elastic band is great.</li>
            <li> I used this once. And on the first use the hose broke. I&#x27;m not going to waste time and effort trying to send it back. I&#x27;m going to see if I can purchase some glue to seal the hose back in the hard plastic nozzle thing. Also this thing doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would have liked. I cannot say that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian, fine, a little longer than shoulder length, straight, hard to curl hair, and I like doing retro style wet sets.  Every other method I have tried....setting and sleeping on the set overnight, air dry, using a hair dryer with a bonnet attachment...all these methods I ended up with frizz every time and would have to apply pomade.  I set my hair for Christmas Eve today and used this dryer for the first time, with plastic rollers and Elan setting lotion.  Smooth, silky soft, beautiful curls!  I did not have to use ANY pomade for the first time ever!  What a fantastic job it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the cap has the drawstrings so it stays on your head.  Better than that cheap bonnet attachment for the hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t cook your hair or flies off your head!  Do yourself a favor DO NOT buy one of those cheapy bonnet attachments for your hair dryer, like I did, and spend the extra money on this!  It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot, but all you got to do is adjust the control switches, no big deal.  I like how the bonnet detaches so if you need to get up and do something, you can detach yourself from the unit.  I love it and I hope it hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Update Dec 26.  I wore my wet set finished hair Christmas Eve, looked just as good the next day on Christmas Day, and I&#x27;m still wearing today in more relaxed waves.  I&#x27;ve never had a wet set last this long!  Usually I have to touch it up with a curling iron the next day, and forget about day three, there was no day three! I would have to wash it out and restyle because it looked horrible by day 2 or 3.  This dryer is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in September 2013. It takes hours to dry my hair (I have locks) and know the poor quality bonnet has come apart.</li>
            <li> My mom was lamenting that a hair dryer just didn&#x27;t set her hair like her old bonnet hair dryer did.  She had an ancient hair dryer from about 40 years ago that she bought after graduating from college.  Sadly, the hose had broken on it and she couldn&#x27;t find a replacement locally.  So onto Amazon we went and found this bonnet hair dryer.  We watched some youtube videos on how it worked and got it.  Very happy with it and the two different settings.  It&#x27;s compact and cute and works a little better than my mom&#x27;s old old one.  It has a handle on it which is a little weird to me, but I suppose people do travel with their hair dryers.  The bonnet is nice and big and has a cinch on it to make it fit.  Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hot, which is great, but it is too small for flexi rods.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it&#x27;s comfortable, and bonnet very roomy which allows for effective and even drying.  The only improvement I would make is a slightly longer cord.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, it is not as loud as others that I have owned but I do not notice that it dries my hair any quicker than older types, without the ion tech, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Such items do not last forever and if I need to in the future, I would purchase this dryer again.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot so it takes no time for your hair to dry. Its sturdy and pretty..:-) very good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  My hair dries in 20 minutes and comes out soft and shiny.  I would recomend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Love it!  Just as I expected and on time!!</li>
            <li> Great purchase for the price.  Love it and as a result, I use it often.</li>
            <li> I got this to dry my naturally curly hair without a hair drier. I sit with the cap on and do my makeup and check emails in the morning. It gets good and hot and has a cool setting. It does a great job, drying my long thick hair in about 20 mins. My only complaint would be that the tube is a little short, but if longer, it might make the drier work too hard. I love it and no longer use my blow drier. It&#x27;s great!!!!</li>
            <li> I like having a heater at home, but you have to sit still, otherwise the hose will detach from the bonnet. I DO like how everything fits into the purple case. Also, it smelled like burning plastic the fist time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, so if you don&#x27;t like noise don&#x27;t buy this. But if you don&#x27;t mind the noise it&#x27;s worth the money. I use larger curlers and fits perfectly, i get beautiful curls everytime.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer. I&#x27;ve used the Conair version of this and I have to say this one is so much better. You are able to keep the dryer on High without burning your scalp. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more.  Thougt it could get hotter and would dry the entire head in one direction.  I usually have to turn the bonnet around so the front of my hair gets dried.</li>
            <li> I like  this product ...works great for my hair issues. i have reccommedned to friends . will order again in the future. I appreciate this product on line .  Thanks for your prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This is my first bonnet dryer, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to outside of beauty shop experiences, but I LOVE IT. It gets my hair (and braids under my sew in) super dry in a little over an hour (my hair always takes a long time to dry) without burning my neck or ears or face. It&#x27;s super easy to use. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a little loud, which means I can&#x27;t watch TV unless it&#x27;s on 100 volume and with subtitles, but that&#x27;s par for the course with a hood dryer. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a high quality and super comfortable and very convenient to store in my NY apartment. So happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white Czech girl with natural curly hair. If there&#x27;s a product made for us curly girls I&#x27;ve bought it. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked. My hair always ends up frizzy wild woman crazy. Laila Ali&#x27;s dryer was a last ditch effort to tame the fro. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work. I sat under the cap for an hour (drove me nuts to sit in once place that long). Even with product in my hair following ALL the directions I came out with a fluffy, halfway dry, cap shaped hair. Granted my hair was soft, but soft helmet hair isn&#x27;t any better than frizzy crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have recommendations?</li>
            <li> The picture is not the dryer I received. The on button is very difficult to push.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> It works very well. But as others have noted when it gets hot, the tube will separate from the bonnet. Odd, since you have to twist lock it in place. I have to reattach repeatedly. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any issues. But this has happened during every subsequent use.</li>
            <li> I kept this in a wish list for the longest .... I am soooooo happy I finally bought it .. works great .. really heats up on high .. It is so nice to slow down enough to relax under the dryer</li>
            <li> o.k. if you like a really hot dryer.  I returned this one, because it was too hot for comfort.  Would not order another with such a large bonnet, as I have short hair, and only roll the top part in the small to medium small  rollers.  The bonnet was droopy due to size.  Also, the case was tipping and rolling on the couch I was sitting on.  Its lid had to be opened for it to work, so it seemed very bulky.  I may be comparing it to the old Conair portable I bought way back 15 or more years ago.  It worked with the hose coming out the side.  It retracted, you just pushed it back into its hole on the small side--it went easily in and locked with a twist.  The bonnet fit easily into a compartment next to the hose&#x27;s.  A cover went over this side when stored. The beauty of it was that with the smallness of the bonnet (which had small holes here and there) the heat was easily adjustable by loosening the bonnet.  It was white like the one they are now selling through Amazon, and small.  Looked similar, but from what the reviews said,  its not the same one at all and getting it apart and together is difficult.  This Laila dryer is difficult to stuff back together, compared to that old, inexpensive conair which is the only other one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this bonnet dryer! Im so happy to have been able to find this it makes my home deep conditioning treatments so much easier.</li>
            <li> Good product and it dry my hair faster than other products I tried before. Doesn&#x27;t make to much noise. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Good quality, strong material, easy to store, I bought 2 conair but the bonnet is very light, the hose is not a good material and it stopped when it gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I love my new one.</li>
            <li> When my gold and hot broke and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to buy; I panicked!  I looked at several soft bonnet dryers before deciding on this one.  I do wish the hose was longer, but it does a great job.  I like that there are different settings.  I sit at my desk and do my makeup while drying my hair!!  Life saver!!</li>
            <li> Nice and compact great air flow. Gets real hot. With Amazon Prime I received it in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive, lightweight, and efficient old fashioned soft bonnet dryer, which is exactly what I was looking for.  The cap fits well over jumbo rollers and big hair with room to spare that can be tightened/adjusted with its string and elasticized front.  I would have assigned this dryer the full five stars if only Ms. Ali had offered replacement soft bonnets as well--now apparently impossible to find anywhere for any brand at any price. (I had to replace my previous hair dryer--still functional--because the cap dried out over time and tore.)  This cap seems to be made of a heavier grade plastic than other standard brands&#x27; bonnets I have owned, so perhaps it will have greater longevity.  I have not found the dryer to be any noisier than other soft bonnet dryers I have owned over the years.  I can&#x27;t speak to the motor&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only owned the dryer for a couple of months, but so far, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased my dryer from wal*mart. At first I was a little confused because it wouldn&#x27;t open, then I realized the bonnet cap and hose was on the side. The set up was pretty simple. You just attach the hose on to the cap and lock it in place. There are 4 settings, cool, low, medium, and hi. When you put the bonnet on there is a drawstring to tighten it, and it stays in place really well. After use, I just unlock the hose from cap, place the cap back into the side component,  push the hose back in, and put it back in the box. Really simple and works great.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this sit under dryer for my daughter in college.  This dryer is well built &amp; well priced, it works great.  She uses hard plastic rollers and the attached hood fits her well.  The dryer also has cool/ hot settings as well as low&amp; high.  I loved it so much that I will be purchasing my own dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I made in 2014! I am so happy I didn&#x27;t invest in the hood dryer, this allows me to hear and see everything and drys my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> super cute hair dryer. i&#x27;ve been looking for a good soft bonnet cap dryer for a while, then i stumbled across this one. not a bad price either..</li>
            <li> This dryer is really high quality and works well to dry my flexirod sets and braid outs. It dries my  damp hair in about 30 minutes and wet hair in about 1.5 hours. However I can only use it on the low heat setting without feeling like my scalp is getting way too hot. Other than that this is awesome! Switching it to cool occasionally is also nice. This dryer is so pretty with the purple case and everything fits inside so it can travel easily.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the conair brand.  The hat is strong and sturdy so it will not rip.  I purchased this over a year ago and it still working great!!!!</li>
            <li> My mother got this for my grandmother and as far as we know my grandmother uses it instead of a handheld dryer every time she puts curlers in.</li>
            <li> I actually first saw this product here on Amazon, but I ended up buying it at my local Walmart. The price wasn&#x27;t significantly different, but I happened to be there and decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this thing. It&#x27;s so easy to use and store. The temperature is pretty good though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it unless it&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this dryer for the most part since I got it for deep conditioning my natural hair. It does a really good job. Like I said I really love this thing and I think for the price it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Works well to dry hair in twists etc...not ideal for big fros but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my salon, for conditioning treatments straighteners.., .  and I love this ... It gets really hot and seem to be comfortable, I love that I can just put it up when I am done..;. and we don&#x27;t have to hold up my dryers.... The only thing is that the buttons on the  bottom back get really hot so make sure to place a towel under the bonnet in the back bottom.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well,  light weight, portable, dries my hair fast, and it reminds me of the old days when you did your own hair at home. I can do a ten minute conditioning, a roller set, or a twenty - thirty minute perm. Who could ask it for more?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this.  It was loud and noisy, gave it to Goodwill.  Spend extra and get a hard hood dryer.</li>
            <li> Initially wrote a review that gave this dryer 4 stars.  It&#x27;s now early Sept and the hose is no longer attached to the base unit.  I can stuff it back in far enough to use the dryer. I also added some duct tape around the opening so I can move around a little, but I did expect better quality.  The dryer has a 2 year limited warranty which should apply, but I only paid $30 for the dryer and by the time I pay postage to send the dryer back plus  add $15 more for return shipping I could almost get another dryer..... Guess I&#x27;ll use it as it is.  Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Heat wattage is excellent. Can easily dry hair in half the time. Excellent bonnet. Large enough to go over a roller set without struggle. Nice length on the air duct and on the cord. My complaints: the storage compartment for the cord and bonnet is ridiculously small at the opening! Also, door to this compartment is so flimsy and cheaply made that I contemplated keeping the bonnet a separate place but ended up not doing because knowing myself will end up losing the bonnet entirely. Overall handle and plastic encasement...Laila Al cheap cheap cheap. It works well but not exactly looking like something that will be around for very long with the cheap construction I&#x27;m very careful with handling it. Would I buy one for a friend? Nope would continue searching for a better one.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works really nicely - I use it to dry my hair for about an hour whenever I do a twist-out and it cuts down on the dry time significantly.</li>
            <li> I love that this is so gentle on hair.  The bonnet, however is a little hard to get over large curlers.  I can do it, but it takes patience!&lt;br /&gt;This is great for deep conditioning...put your favorite deep conditioner in damp hair (I use BioSilk Fruit Cocktail Reconstructing Treatment) and put a disposable shower cap on, followed by the dryer bonnet and let the heat do its work for about 15 minutes.  Rinse out and hair is silky soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and I absolutely love this. Trust me when I say it is money well spent. It get Very hot but it has different levels. Is a little loud so watching TV may be any issue. I also use an extension cord with it as well and haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. The hood is very large as well.</li>
            <li> my wife ordered this dryer and she just loves it...no regrets</li>
            <li> This is a very durable, light weight, high quality soft bonnet dryer.  The design style and luscious purple color are so chic.  This dryer is great to use at home and traveling abroad. I read some reviews complaining about the noise, and initially I agreed with them.  But when I turned the dryer over facing down, the noise level was reduced drastically.</li>
            <li> Although, I purchase this dryer last year I have only  used it maybe three times and now it want come on. The reason I ordered the dryer was because the first one cap came apart and now this one has  stop working.  Its sad when you pay your money and get a poor product.</li>
            <li> Came very quick without express (anyone in Hawaii will definitely understand). As mentioned in previous reviews, the hose does slip out and when I actually looked at it, it&#x27;s a design flaw by manufactures. When I was ready to use it I made sure it was twisted into position and carefully put the hose behind me. It seems to stay if the entire thing is behind you instead of on the side or whatever. Also, the hot setting is that ... HOT!! Even with a towel around my neck, it was too hot for me to handle. The medium setting was pretty hot on my ears but I just moved the bonnet from over my ears when they got to hot. All in all so far I love it!! I was able to deep condition and try my hair very nicely! Love it!</li>
            <li> Its compact, versatile and does the job with my medium to large roller set. Much better than my hard hat dryer, glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this dryer in November I was beyond excited to use it. I used it for the first time in de ember and was blown away about how hot the dryer got and how quickly it dried my hair. 2 weeks ago I think the motor gave out. The dryer wasn&#x27;t blowing as fast. As of today it is barely blowing anything out and the nozzle will no longer stay attached to the hood. I have only used this thing 10 times while seated, upright, on a stable surface, so I am confused as to why it has gave out. The only thing I can think of is that it&#x27;s a piece of junk.  I would return it, but conveniently the window of returns just closed. JUST GREAT! $50 wasted.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I use this to set my twist styles. Works well and fast, but needs a longer tube. It&#x27;s a little loud--but overall a great styling tool. Lightweight, easy to store and move about!</li>
            <li> We all love it in my family.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets hot enough (on the highest setting, I put a towel on my neck just in case), and dries my hair pretty quickly.  I love that the bonnet tube is long enough so that I can work on my computer or read comfortably while my hair is drying.  I&#x27;ve taken this dryer on a long car trip, and it was definitely worth bringing it along.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and was not sure about buying this thing ! It is just amazing, I guess it depends on your type of hair !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE: my hair is so soft and curly when used with rollers.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and size of it.  I have not had a problem keeping the bonnet on and it drys my hair within a decent time.  I have very thick natural hair and my hair dries usually within one hour and some change.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I needed a soft bonnet as I didn&#x27;t want to be encumbered by a hard hat version.  This thing packs heat, has various settings and the bonnet is fully adjustable.</li>
            <li> I really, really lke this product.  It&#x27;s convenient and has a somewhat soothing noise--when it&#x27;s on the low setting.  My only reason for not giving it a #5 is because when I put it on high, it gets too hot, and I can&#x27;t handle it.  It is soothing and does the job, but I just wish it had a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting.  When it&#x27;s on low, it doesn&#x27;t really dry the very front and very back of my hair.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good hair dry, and I would purchase the soft bonnet again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use the medium heat setting because high is too hot for me. It is great for my conditioning treatments. I recommend this dryer to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it and although it does what it is suppose to, it is either really hot or not hot enough. I m only using this as a deep conditioner dryer and roller-setting for now. It will also come off your head if it is not tight, so I tie my band around the front to secure it.</li>
            <li> I love this Dryer!  Was not confident it would work like a conventional dryer, but it works just as good and the convenience is priceless.</li>
            <li> I wanted a drier that could heat and cool, not just another heated head wrap. This one works great. The only drawback for me is the feeder tubing is about a hair too short. I would prefer a longer one by another foot.  Overall: we&#x27;ll worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This works well and gets really hot!! Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of African, Native-American &amp; Caribbean descent, and have been chemical-free (relaxer) since 2008.  I used to go to the salon every other week to have my hair done in either straight or curly hairstyles, but I have had to decrease my visits immensely because of financial reasons.  So, I have been doing my own hair since about December 2012.  This dryer is perfect for me because it dries my thick hair quickly (about an hour, which falls into my normal drying range at the salon) without a great deal of heat.  It is not extremely loud, because I can watch TV while I&#x27;m drying my hair without having to turn up the volume to 50, and I can also hear my telephone ringing without having the phone right next to me.  The dryer is also light weight &amp; though this should not matter, it is also stylish.</li>
            <li> I wish that there was a better way to adjust the cap. It has a draw string on it (shoe string) that doesn&#x27;t quite work for me. The drier itself is ok...convenient and will dry your hair. It good when I don&#x27;t feel like sitting under my hood drier.</li>
            <li> This was just what I had been searching for as I am doing some deep conditioning treatments and this unit fits the bill. It also has an extra large cap that fits roller sets.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully used for the purposes that I intended to use it for but, using it as a heater for my deep conditioner/color have been fabulous! After an hour on heat/low air, my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry back it did warm it up quite a bit...I also intended to use it for when I put in my curl-formers when I&#x27;m on the go-haven&#x27;t tried it for that purposes yet, but when I do I will probably update this review...I don&#x27;t intend to use it to completely dry my hair though-not even the beauty salon/high price hair dryers completely dry my hair with rollers etc. But with the price and ease of use I&#x27;d give it a 5 but for a con that I had with it, I give it a 4 (unless it does a wonderful job with the curlformers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used someone else&#x27;s Gold n&#x27; Hot hair dryer bonnet machine-thingy that looks very similar to this and I was comparing the 2 in order to decided which one I would purchase and I am satisfied with the Laila Ali version because of price, a little more even-ness of air flow under the bonnet, and that this bonnet stays put as with the Gold n&#x27; Hot constant has to be adjusted and it feels like it gone with the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair Type: Thick, Long, Shoulder-Length (curly-natural), Under-Shoulder Blades (straight-blow dry/heat), 4a/b around head (front &amp; back), 4c in the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy Setup, some even air flow, compact, the price (under $40).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: LOUD, could use more air flow in the front of the head.</li>
            <li> Wow heat up great and cool down great also good price and stores wonderful in small spaces.</li>
            <li> It all in one compact. Easy to read temperatures settings (4 settings from cool to hot).&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is adjustable in case you use different rollers or flex rods to deep treatment (with a plastic cap.&lt;br /&gt;Compartment for cord and bonnet. and a convenient storage for the hose.  Especially for natural hair girls perfect to set your curls and avoid heat damage. Love it. I have shoulder length hair and did a flex rod twist. I was under the dryer for about an hour and a half but still slightly damp. But my hair always took an hour and a half with the salon dryers. Next time i will just use the flex rods without the twist.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing that I can say about this is that the hose is a bit particular about how it has to be attached into the hood to stay in.  There could be more room for hood storage but it will fit in the space available.  A compact, easy to carry and use hair dryer for those of us who still roll our hair the old fashion way. Be forewarned:  IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LOUD.</li>
            <li> The bonnet fits really good and true to the temperature setting.I would highly recommend it to a friend.One thing I wish was different is the coil(connection) gets so warm and uncomfortable, may be they can improve on that.</li>
            <li> It did just what I needed perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer. I have curly hair, and it allows my hair to dry with a natural look, free of frizz. And I really love how easy it is, I just put it on and let it work while I work on my computer or watch TV.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m old fashioned but I like to set my hair in rollers.  I had been looking for a portable dryer for years, and this one works great.  It is very compact and can be carried and set up anywhere.  The bonnet top is large and will work with even large rollers.  I can now set my hair in rollers and sit for 30 to 45 minutes and take out the rollers and am ready to go.  I would recommend this dryer for anyone who still uses rollers.  I find that using rollers lets my hair stay styled longer than blowing it dry or using a curling iron.  So, all I can say is I just love it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a bonnet dryer for months and had only run across cheaply made ones. I found this one on Amazon and the reviews are spot on. This thing is AMAZING! I&#x27;m actually typing this review while I&#x27;m wearing it and I have zero complaints. For those people who said it did not get hot enough...please take a second to play with the the settings because as I am trying it is cooking my head lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight which is great and easy to store and travel with. The bonnet is generously sized so I&#x27;m certain I could easily fit over head full of rollers if I tried. I used while deep conditioning and I can&#x27;t complain. Evenly distributed the heat. I used on medium setting and it was sufficiently warm. The price is reasonable for quality. My only minor &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I did find it louder than I expected, but by no means louder than many hooded dryers.</li>
            <li> I love the compact size and the performance of this dryer. The bonnet is big enough to fit over big curlers. It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns anything. The airflow is good and the heat setting is comfortable.  As an added bonus, it comes in my favorite color!   Review Update:  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and still love it!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much because it was a soft bonnet dryer and they used to be TERRIBLE.  This one did not dissappoint.  I wrapped my hair, tied the dryer on, turned it to high and it dried evenly in less than 30 minutes.  I was completely expecting damp sections but found none.  I wish I could give it a 10!</li>
            <li> I remember growing up and this was what most people used. I always liked these better than blow dryers and was happy when I found they were still available. DO YOUR RESEARCH! Several people who bought different brands complained that their dryer would automatically shut off after 20 minutes. Some didn&#x27;t get hot enough, some weren&#x27;t heating evenly. After weighing all the pros and cons, I chose this one and am very glad I did. It&#x27;s just like the one I had when I was younger! It heats up quickly and evenly. I use mine for about an hour at a time and have had no problems at all. The bonnet is large enough to accommodate a head full of rollers - some people complained about having to pull the ties around the edge of your face. This didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The ties stayed in place and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I had a Sasson bonnet dryer and the soft bonnet was very cheap and the nozzle attachment ripped.  This bonnet is very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t seem as if the attachment is going to rip.  One of the reviewers stated that air comes out of the sides of the bonnet because there is no elastic.  I agree that having elastic all around the bonnet would help, but this way you can hear people talk because of the opening.  It still dries the hair without a problem.  My ears don&#x27;t burn, just the back of my neck where the hose attaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely happy with this dryer. It is affordable and works very well. The temperature is just right and it doesn&#x27;t take up any space. No complaints...yet lol</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed and works very well!  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that and you&#x27;ll not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a very good product .Glad I made the purchase. Very satisfied. Will recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer with the intention of using it for deep conditioning my hair and occasionally speeding up the drying process of my twist outs. The first I used it for deep conditioning it was fine. The second time around I used for the same purpose and it shut off on me while it was on the low heat setting. I read in the manual that it may shut off if one of the air ducts is blocked so I unplugged it and let it cool off for about 7 minutes or so. When I turned it back on it only would work on the high heat setting so I had to finish deep conditioning my hair with blazing hot air. Unfortunately, I had discovered later that the high cool setting is basically the same as the low heat setting. So if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself just use the high cool setting for deep conditioning and the low cool setting for drying.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this dryer due to some reviews but I&#x27;m so glad I did. I put it on, turned the heat to medium (high is too hot), and in 40 mins, voila! Frizz free, bouncy, soft curls. I could hardly believe my hair! It&#x27;s VERY hard for me to have frizz free hair. I have 3A type curls and long hair (down to backside) that needs a lot of moisture. Before i was using a diffuser but I&#x27;d still end up really frizzy. My hair is so long and thick it takes hours to air dry. So....I highly recommend this dryer for curly haired women who want to reduce drying time, frizz, and have bouncy hair! I only wish I did a comparison video because I&#x27;m that impressed! Oh and I bought mine from Walmart but it&#x27;s about $10 cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great bonnet to use for deep conditioning, and drying twist out styles so that I don&#x27;t go to bed with wet hair. Dries quickly and the cool setting is great for natural hair so that you can dry a style without necessarily using heat. Also the bonnet uses a shoestring type tie which is sturdy and helps keep the bonnet secure. A nice bonus over a regular dryer is that your ears don&#x27;t get hot! None of the heat escapes the bonnet for me and it&#x27;s very comfortable to keep on for the 20-30 minute deep condition I do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on 11/19/13 I ordered one day shipping because I wanted to use it for this weekend which is my birthday. It came in the mail today 11/20/13 and its BROKEN....when I first opened the box I saw a big SCRATCH on the top part of the storage case. Where the handle is on the front the latch is BROKEN so I cannot open the case and see what the actual dryer looks like!!!! This is a big disappointment!!!!! Called amazon and they should be sending me another one tomorrow!!! Lets see how That one comes smh laila....not the greatest -_-</li>
            <li> Even though I tie the Bonnet tight, when the high/hot setting is on, hot air escapes onto my skin.  This only happens in a small space, but I end up having to put something there to block the air, like a kleenex.  Since I have a lot of hair, I use the higher setting so that my hair will dry faster, but when it gets too hot, I switch to the low setting for a brief time.  These type of dryers are not easy to find, in my opinion.  Otherwise the dryer does the job that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, the tube/cord gets super hot and that&#x27;s really not a pleasant feeling. I&#x27;ve mastered how to get it to not touch my neck but you don&#x27;t want to be uncomfortable while sitting under a dryer for hours. It does do what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which is produce heat but I would go for another brand if i was you (person looking at this item).</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for over a month now and I have used it around 5 or 6 times and I must say I like it.The casing is beautiful and is not cheaply made but once you open it up and get inside you do get a &amp;#34;gimmicky&amp;#34; feeling, like this is another product that may stay in the box untouched in your closet most of the time. But I find that I actually like using it. Setup is pretty self explanatory, I cannot imagine what you would need instructions for. There is a plastic smell that you get during use the first few times, it does go away. I found that it does a great time maintaining optimal heat levels under the bonnet and has no problems with getting entire head heated, even nape area.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I have with hair bonnet is not a deal breaker, but the bonnet is really more for someone who is drying hair with rollers rather than someone simply deep conditioning. The bonnet is huge and so I end up tying the shoe string pulls around the base of the bonnet twice and then tying it up. I even once tied it around my head once and then under my chin to prevent the bonnet from lifting, because it does blow up like a hot air balloon, feeling as if it would like to lift up from off your head.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, especially for this price.</li>
            <li> the hoodie keeps coming off the hose, it works great if you can get it to stay on, I guess its duct tape time!!</li>
            <li> I brought this via Walmart and just got it shipped to the UK last year. I thought I could use my travel adapter.&lt;br /&gt;The thing just smoked and that was it. Do not waste your money if you are in the UK.</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase! First, let me say that Amazon absolutely fulfilled their &amp;#34;One Day Guaranteed&amp;#34; shipping. I needed this product in a hurry and Amazon did their part. It was waiting for me when I got home from work the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and curly biracial hair (African American and Caucasian). My hair can be hard to manage at times, especially now in the colder months. I recently discovered using Jumbo sized rollers to straighten my hair (and the rollers leave nice, bouncy curls and the ends). The bonnet on this dryer DID fit over my head full of Jumbo sized roller. It took just a bit of maneuvering to get it over, but it does fit. The hose that attaches from the dryer unit onto the bonnet is a good length and it didn&#x27;t get too hot. It was warm, but I also had a sweatshirt on to protect my back. The unit was not overly noisy. I was able to watch a movie on my laptop (using headphones) and I had no trouble hearing the audio. In all, it took about 40 minutes to dry my hair completely, whereas before, it took about 5 hours to air dry it while wearing the rollers. I am thrilled that this dryer has drastically reduced my drying time. Seriously, who has five+ hours to spare air drying their hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
            <li> My first dryer came scuffed up so I had to exchange but it was done very quickly. I will revisit with update on this after few more uses because last night I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off after having it running for 30 minutes. I will see if it happens again. It does get hot on high!!! Medium is definitely more tolerable. Update to come on durability...</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to cut my henna processing time from 4 hours to 2 hours.  And it does the job!  I like the fact that you can switch the heat settings easily.  I used it mostly on medium heat as the high heat can get really hot, but I&#x27;m glad that I have that option. Only time will tell how long it will last as I will only be using it every six to eight weeks, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and very happy that I&#x27;ve gained back a couple of hours where I can go out in public!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as I write this review!!! I love it let me tell you what to do!  1)style hair as desired or just detangle as normal 2) turn or Netflix or your favorite show 3) stack your pillows on you bed to prop your back comfortably 4)plug in your dryer and assemble now enjoy! Lol idk why people are making this device to difficult! Put the thing on your bed and make sure you have a towel around your neck so it doesn&#x27;t burn, that&#x27;s the beauty of this dryer!!! You can lounge around the house with it! Get you and extension cord and sit in the couch or the bed there is no need to be sitting on the floor or tables no longer ladies! And it heats up fast and medium setting is hot enough</li>
            <li> This dryer is great as far as the motor. The blower blows so good that I have to only put it on low. If I put it up high like I did my last dryer it would be too hot. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that the vibration cause it to hit the floor a couple times before I knew why. Didn&#x27;t break so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful !</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. The heat distributes very evenly.  My wife and I were impressed with how much quieter it is compared to our last one.</li>
            <li> The cord is very uncomfortable,its too short and its very hard to pull out/store back inside.(the material is very thin, and if your not very careful you can easily break it).</li>
            <li> The second time I went to use it the white hose come unattached from the hair dryer. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I like everything else about it. Now what?!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago and by looking at it wasn&#x27;t too encouraged to try it right away.  Then the day came I needed to dry my hair pronto AND do my nails to be ready for an event.  The darn thing worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> An amazing product that I use weekly for my deep conditioning treatment.  It is easy to use, and does the job everytime.  One of the best purchases that I made this year!</li>
            <li> This dryer works great on my curly hair, the only problem is, since I&#x27;m not using curlers, it flattens the hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I puchase this dryer about a month ago. The bonnet is full size and very comfortable.The hi setting is very hot, I could keep it there for about 10 minutes. But the low setting will do the job. I have very thick corse hair. It usually take my hair about 45 minutes to dry on high under a hooded dryer. This dryer dried my hair in 25 minutes. It is very easy to store and set up. Do yourself a favor and purchase one for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made compared to others like it.  The bonnet is of a good quality plastic, the hose is of a good quality and it&#x27;s not too noisy.  Also, I like the sleek contemporary design of it.  It has 500 watts of power (most others have 400 but that extra 100 makes a difference in drying time) and does have 4 settings on it.</li>
            <li> I brought it for $40 at Walmart &amp; I am very happy with it. I used it on the low heat setting for 26 minutes to process my hair color. I wore a plastic cap on my hair. The heat was comfortable &amp; pleasant. I am going to use it to do a roller set next. It works &amp; feels just like a professional salon hooded dryer. I used it while sitting on my couch watching a movie. Even on the low setting the heat is HOT but not too hot. I am so glad i got this dryer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this jumped up in price so much...I need to buy another as a gift....but now its $11 more the when I found it a few days ago plus shipping... breaks my heart lol...now I have to spend time looking for a lower price</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward for this dryer, for the most part I like it but it fit  a little uncomfortable.  It heats hotter on certain areas of my head than others.  Will see how it work out.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic find! The dryer is really cute, compact, and best of all-portable! I primarily use the lowest heat setting as it provides plenty of heat! It&#x27;s moderately loud and definitely has the potential to burn your ears and/or neck-my advice: wear a damp towel and keep it moving! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!!  I LOVE it!! :-)</li>
            <li> I like the portability of this product (it wraps up nicely inside the case) there are only a few things i didn&#x27;t like. The first being that part where the cap connects to the tube gets really warm i just wish the heat was a tad bit more evenly distributed. and the second is the black drawstring cap is HUGE, i use the dryer for conditioning treatments so the drawstring barley closes up enough for me to feel like its securely on my head. My head is rather average so i have to tie the extra string round my head to make it feel like its not going to move. other than that I&#x27;m very glad i got this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to Use, Dries my hair quickly. It does get hot around your neck because of the air holes in the dryer but that you can put a towel around your neck. Out side of that this is a great portable hair dryer. Love IT!!</li>
            <li> My item has a black bonnet. Maybe the colors have changed since I ordered some months ago. I really like the item and have made adjustments for keeping the bonnet on. I don&#x27;t tie it at all and tuck the bonnet behind my ears, or tie very tightly around the forehead. I usually use the low setting and the bonnet stays on well in that setting. The loudness of the item is as expected. I close the lid some, to muffle the sound. I really like having it compact and easy to store and travel with if necessary. Great product!</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, and isn&#x27;t as bulky as a hooded dryer.  It&#x27;s easy to put up and tuck away.  I also like that I can sit comfortably while wearing it anywhere, even in bed.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  Just remember to twist hose in helmet until a slight click is heard or felt; that hose can worm its way out.</li>
            <li> This dryer was perfect for our family. The bonnet was nice and big, it dried my hair in very little time and it is hotttttt.</li>
            <li> The hose could be just a LITTLE bit longer and it would be great if the lid opened all the way (it only opens to a 90 degree angle and falls down if you move around, obstructing the vent)...I really like have a bonnet versus those inexpensive hood dryers (ie the ones sold at Wally World) my hair dries faster. Note: mine is not made like the picture with the hose coming out of the side. I have the one that opens like a clamshell and the hose kind of curls around the motor and there&#x27;s a little section to store the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I ultimately wanted a Pibbs hooded hair dryer but I don&#x27;t really have room for it right now. All other bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried either doesn&#x27;t really fit my head when I am doing a roller set or it just doesn&#x27;t work that well. That was not the case with this one. The first one I received didn&#x27;t have the bonnet included in the box, but Amazon sent me out another one pretty quickly and I&#x27;ve loved it every since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fit. I love the amount of heated air coming out of the dryer. I don&#x27;t have to sit under it all day with my roller sets like I have to with other dryers. I&#x27;ve already had it for a year and it still works just as great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I bought it so I could set my mother&#x27;s hair in between her weekly salon appointments &amp; we love it!</li>
            <li> I have Nubian local and this dryer works great. I need another bonnet as I tore mine.  How can I get another bonnet?</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use, efficient, well-priced, and oh such a pretty purple!! On the negative side however,some hot air does escape and bonnet at times needs to be adjusted during use, but overal a good product for the price. Bottom line, hair dries quickly and fits over head nicely, with or without rollers. Will be purchasing one as a a gift or my sister who loved it when she used it to do my hair. So glad it&#x27;s back in stock.  Had to wait for a while for this to be back in stock to buy for my sister. She also loves it!</li>
            <li> The first dryer I ordered looked as if it had been a returned item.  The purple case was smudged especially around switches, and overall, it just didn&#x27;t look new.  I tried to clean it up but then decided to ask for an exchange which was no problem at all.  However, the second dryer looked even worse.  You could tell the box had been opened, as it was ripped where the tape to close the box was located.  Also the case was scraped up.  I really don&#x27;t know if this was a new dryer.  There was different packing in each. The caps looked different from each as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did keep the second one, but I haven&#x27;t even tried the dryer to know if it works well. If these were new, the plant that makes them needs to be cleaner and wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Great dryer. I use it for deep conditioning, diffusing my wash and gos, and rod sets mostly. Awesome dryer, I get my hair dry within an hour, rather than having to air dry for 8+ hours. Also like that when I diffuse my wash and gos, not only does it dry faster, my curls look really shiny and they don&#x27;t feel crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really excited to use this for whatever else I can think of in the future. Only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase it sooner.</li>
            <li> This was okay.  I was not totally impressed with it.  I didn&#x27;t particullarly care for the hood. and the hose is limited.  Also the heat setting is limited. I used it once and havent taken it back out since.</li>
            <li> Using the dryer at first sucked! Like I seen a few others say, the bonnet wouldn&#x27;t stay attached. But one day I twisted the nozzle a little tighter and bam! It was on like glue! My head is considerably small and the cap fits just fine  (thanks to the adjustable string). And the heat settings range perfectly. Glad I purchased this bonnet, so much better than that big plastic one you see in the salon.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer. It gets really hot so I put a towel around my neck because of the heat. I sit under it for about 30 minutes with conditioner on my hair or for an hour if I have rods in my hair. It is very convenient that I can sit under the dryer and sit in the bed, read, watch YouTube or even my nails without having to have a big hair dryer. It works very fast and my daughter uses it as well and I have not had any problems. It is a very nice color too.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and I was nervous that this may not work well for me. It does! I sit under it for an hour and my hair is dry no matter what style I am doing. I have natural hair and usually it takes forever for my hair to dry when I twist it or braid it, but now I don&#x27;t have to worry. My only criticism is that I can&#x27;t use it on high because it pops off my head. low is more slow and steady.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer. I have dreaded the hard shell hair dryers for OH so long and how sedentary I&#x27;ve always felt sitting underneath them. The mission for this bonnet dryer was simple...I had a head full of flexirods I needed dry in an hour before heading out for evening libations. I put it on high and hot and prayed, PRAYED that it would be dry in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict...err, maybe 90 minutes (I had A LOT of product in my hair) but my curls were absolutely perfect. I thought for sure this bonnet would only be suitable for deep conditioning but it is a very HIGH quality product. Kudos to Laila Ali for not putting a bunch of junk out there for consumers to consume in vain. This was a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought a hardshell dryer a week ago and I&#x27;m going to toss it now. If you&#x27;re looking for a bonnet that can handle a roller set with ease, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Dries hair pretty fast. Love it...</li>
            <li> Extra large bonnet which is great. I wish the hose was a bit longer but it works. Main problem is that the medium setting is too hot. Not much difference between medium and high. Usually have to turn it to low where it is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot. Hose slips, that&#x27;s super annoying. But it does the job</li>
            <li> The first one was defective - started smoking the first time I use it!  Returned it though Amazon.com and 2nd one shipped with no problems.  At first I was afraid to order the dryer because I wrap my hair - I thought it would slip off since I&#x27;m not roller setting it.  But I have not had any trouble with it.  However it is clearly made for bigger hair/rollers.  If I don&#x27;t tighten it around my head, it will slide off.  I can dry my hair in less time, because it gets very hot on the high temp.  My only concern is that down the road the bonnet strap will snap because I have to tighten it very close to my head.  For now, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> i LIKE THE OLD MODEL BETTER.  THIS ONE SLIPS OFF SURFACES MORE EASILY</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer, It really does the job.....the cool setting is warm and the hot gets really hot!! so I switch back and forth until my hair is dry.....</li>
            <li> The low/high switch is broken. Stuck in low after the first usage. I am very very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> I like it, Its noisier then I thought it would be. I thought I would be able to watch tv and hear it, you can&#x27;t.  My hair isn&#x27;t that long so it only takes 30 minutes to dry. I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about their ears burning. Do they leave them under the cap? I had no problems. I have huge rollers and it fit under the cap. A little tricky getting them under there, but  they fit. I don&#x27;t have to use it all the time just when I am in a hurry. There is a funky smell that comes from the tube that blows the air to the cap. I not sure what that is,it doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic.  Would I buy it again. Yes. I love you can pack it all in one case.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a dryer before. The only type I have is a blow dryer but nothing where you sit and wait. I love it! I bought it for my birthday hoping to relieve myself from standing while drying my hair and it&#x27;s awesome! It sounds a bit weird because I do get bored while blow drying my hair but with this I can just sit at the computer and do some work or read a book.</li>
            <li> This is like being in a salon in the confines of your own home I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The only con...is that; when its on high the heat emanates... from the back &amp; scorches your neck a bit so I always use a towel around my neck before applying the hat on my head.  I don&#x27;t believe that this is a defect though but only due to the size of the hat to accommodate larger size curlers etc.  But other than this ... I get an excellent steam treatment and hair drying with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mandy...</li>
            <li> Have had this product for a month. I use it to deep condition my hair. It heats up quickly, the bonnet has a drawstring so it stays put even when delivering hot air. The compact size is an added advantage for the space-challenged. The compact size has not diminished its effectiveness. Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I love my dryer. So much easier and cheaper to sit at home rather than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> The tube kept detaching and the bonnet was hard to put over my curlers. I like the mobility of this though and the lowest setting is super hot.</li>
            <li> So far I like this hair dryer very easy to carry and everything fits right into to side compartments at first I thought that the cord and the bonnet was missing but as I looked on the side of the dryer there it was.</li>
            <li> Compact and I finally found something to hold my jumbo rollers! You get enough slack to move around a bit and not too loud. Good product!</li>
            <li> I actually have the black and purple bonnet dryer, the one that has a bonnet that looks like a very large, black shower cap. It works well. Pros: The dryer DOES dry my hair in about half the time it takes under a hooded dryer...about (45min--an hour instead of 1.5-2 hrs.). I have very thick, coarse and dense natural hair, so I was impressed! The bonnet stays put while I  sit in a chair or on the floor and complete other tasks...Like the first time I used it, I was sorting hair products on the floor, and was able to move around with ease. I also read books and watched TV the 2nd time I used it. It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use. I had it out of town and it fit wonderfully in my carry on bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The bonnet opens up around my hairline in the front and feels like little hairs are tickling my face...but it&#x27;s the air from the dryer coming out. ALso, the bonnet tube that the air travels in gets REALLY HOT! So you have to be careful. It smooshes my hair a little bit. SO when my hair was dry, I had to fluff it out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it looks like the version pictured on AMAZON is an improved version than from what I have, so it should be better. But what I have is still good.</li>
            <li> Am very satisfied with the soft Bonnet Dryer</li>
            <li> Finally a bonnet dryer that fits all my rollers!  Been in the market looking for one like this for over a year.  So glad I made this purchase. Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the dryer, however have only one complaint.  The bonnet is rather large, and as a result the heat escapes from the back of it and causes your neck to get really hot.  I would recommend putting a towel around your neck to prevent it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice dryer for a while. I couldn&#x27;t really test any out, but I decided to buy this one for about $55. It&#x27;s perfect. It does get hot af after a while lol, but the cooler setting that it has works just as well. I recently just cut my hair off, so I needed a dryer for wrapping. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to dry, which is great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time. Honestly, I&#x27;ve been to beauty salons that had dryers that weren&#x27;t this good. But I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month, so idk how long this greatness will last....</li>
            <li> Works great...only downfall is that the bonnet is a bit big have to tie a scarf around the edges to keep the hot air from blowing out and burning my neck or ears.</li>
            <li> I love this item it works well and is so sturdy and well made for the price. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Was looking for a bonnet dryer to replace my Gold-N-Hot hard bonnet dryer that died. Was not expecting this dryer to be so hot or powerful. Like previous reviewers have said that there is really no cool setting. You get warm or hot air only. Great for deep conditioning with heat. My only complaint is that Amazon did a horrible job with the shipping and I got my dryer more than 10 days late.</li>
            <li> Only took off a star because it burns you a little in the back, after having it on for a while. But, I use it for pre-pooing and deep conditioning and it works great. Been using it for about a year or so and I love it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it allows the flexibility to move around while drying my hair.  I really love it.  It gets &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; hot.  I have course hair which usually takes some time to dry but not with this dryer.  I use it on low temp.  It is a good value for the money.  My daughters use it and they love it as well.  Thanks Laila</li>
            <li> This dryer is great! I would recommend it to anyone. Especially if you want something neat and compact. The only thing that I&#x27;m still trying to get use to is the cap. I&#x27;m still playing around with how to keep it on my head in a comfortable way without it falling off. I think I found a way to do that, which is to pull the draw strings around to the front of my head (kinda like a head tie you sleep with at night). Overall, I love this thing, great for my DC&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a strong, hot dryer. Because it is so strong, the bonnet, when the dryer is on high, wants to blow right off your head! A lil creativity with tying the strings can help, but I am still perfecting this technique...lol. Also, the hose gets very hot when its running...just in case you have kids around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seems well made and worth the $40 I spent. It&#x27;s a big improvement over the vintage bonnet dryer I used to use.  The bonnet is large enough for my big head and two inch rollers. Its nice and compact when closed up.</li>
            <li> Bought to help dry my daughters hair to set curls. Dryer worked great and has a very roomy bonnet. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that I could use while comfortably seated on my couch (as opposed to being perched upright in a hard chair while using my traditional hard-hood dryer).  I was able to do just that with this dryer. It took me approximately the same amount of time to dry my hair as with my hard-hood dryer.  The bonner covered my entire head full of large, hard rollers. I felt like the heat was hot enough and not too hot, though I did place a towel around my neck for comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used portable hair dryers for years. My last one still works, it&#x27;s just so old (10+ years)  and beat up it was time for a replacement. This product looked like the perfect solution. Lots of great features. The case is solid and sturdy, and I like purple. The hood and electric cord fit inside easily for storage. This dryer gets HOT! Have to fit the hood on the head carefully to avoid burning the neck. Temperature can be modulated by using the HOT/COOL and HI/LOW features. Everything was great the first two uses. However, on the third use, the hose separated from the plastic connector. This can easily be repaired with a little masking tape, but if I wanted raggedy, I could have just kept using my old dryer.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife wanted, but found we couldn&#x27;t use it because the voltage here in Australia is 240 volt &amp; the voltage of the dryer was 110 volt, so we had to dump it. I would advise anybody buying electrical appliances from overseas to check out the voltage first, as you are not advised of this when you buy online. Amazon were top class because they refunded the full price when they actually didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this dryer.  I haven&#x27;t given myself a deep conditioner with heat in so long, so i decided to order this.  It&#x27;s convenient, I love the color and it get&#x27;s the job done!!!</li>
            <li> Fiance loves it. Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s 500 watts so I do have to stay under it for a while but with the TV and iPad...the time flies by.</li>
            <li> The hose does not lock in to the cap well, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> This dryer was exactly what I needed.  It worked well, got very hot, was compact and very easy to store.  I had read a few reviews where people said they had trouble with the bonnet staying on their heads if they were not using large rollers.  I had no rollers in my hair (my hair is natural so I was drying my twists).  I tightened and tied the strings attached the to bonnect and had no trouble with it coming off.  I put a  small hand towel around the back of my neck as advised in one of the reviews to avoid the heat bothering my neck and I had no prolbem at all.  I also love the purple and black color of the dryer.  It looks sleek and stylish.Overall, I was very impressed with the performance and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair in the same amount of time as my previous hard, heavy-duty hair dryer.  The Laila is lightweight and easier for me to move to various areas in the house -- my previous dryer was cumbersome and heavier and hard for me to carry from place to place and took up a lot more room to store.  I didn&#x27;t need to put the bonnet dryer back in the case it came in so I don&#x27;t know if it would be easy or not.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, comfortable, however use a towel around your shoulders it tends to get very hot, other than that is money well spent, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  It is very easy to use and I love that it is portable and convenient.  I have used a hooded dryer for years and this is so much better.  I can lay back on the sofa with my feet kicked up and read or watch TV while my hair drys! My drying results are better too because my entire head is covered and sometimes the back can take longer to dry with a hooded dryer if I&#x27;m not sitting just right under it!  I love this purchase - and it was a great value!</li>
            <li> this dyer gets HOT. the bonnet is big and blows off my head even at its tightest. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and it is LOUD. save your money and get something else.</li>
            <li> its a wonderful addition to my beauty regimen. It&#x27;s easy to use and assemble, its  efficient and stores neatly in my closet.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed. Ordered the bonnet Tuesday, got it today (Thursday). I was so excited to use this bonnet dryer. I was impressed with the compact, common sense hose, bonnet and cord storage but when I pushed the Hi/Low on buttons nothing happened.  Checked the outlet with other appliances to make sure there was nothing wrong with the outlet but got nothing from the dryer. I am so bummed. Not sure I want an exchange. I don&#x27;t want the next one to quit working on day 31 when I can no longer return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this despite the negative feedback  I read. Unfortunately, I encountered some of the negative experiences  shared by some of the reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two of these from different vendors. Returned both. The first one did not appear to be new.  It had visual wear and tear. Signs around the seams made me think it had been rebuilt. I checked to see if it worked.  Strong air flow but got very hot even in the low setting. Did not want a used item so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another dryer from a different vendor. This item had dirt marks on the tube and the casing had finger prints, etc. It also was not new. Checked to see if it even worked.  Item did not distribute match air but seriously overheated in a matter of minutes,  It even had an overheated smell.  I sent both items back to their vendors and have no intention of ever ordering any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns were handled without any issues by both vendors</li>
            <li> Great item. Very easy to use and store.It does get hot pretty quickly and sometimes I have to turn down the settings or rotate where the hose is blowing</li>
            <li> After the first use it stopped working. Due to the cost of returning the item I decided to cut my losses.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well, but the hose does not stay attached to the bonnet. It has to be held, right at the connection, which is frustrating because it gets hot. If the hose would stay attached, it would be great. Not sure if this is normal for this product or if I have a defective product?</li>
            <li> I only used this Dryer once, and I like it a lot. I found it easy to use and the bonnet is large enough to go over big rollers and you can adjust the bonnet over your ears so they don&#x27;t burn!  A great find.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer. It&#x27;s about the length of the average laptop but so much lighter. It fits perfectly in my carry on tote bag; so I take it with me when I travel. Enjoying the fact that I can attach this to an extension cord and can multi task (vaccum, wash/fold laundry). The cap fits easily over my rollers. And because it&#x27;s so small, it stores easily. Dries my long hair in 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this is the best dryer.  Gets very hot (will not burn or anything like that) but my hair feels like silk after using for conditioning treatments and my hair is relaxed but 4c texture.  My conditioning treatments have gone to whole new level.  Anyhow, this is a great dryer,  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly!  My favorite part is that I don&#x27;t feel hot because the heat is concentrated within the bonnet. Even on the hot/high setting, it is still very comfortable (i.e., I&#x27;m not sweating or my head doesn&#x27;t feel like it is overheating.) Glad I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps I have very long hair and use 1 in rollers.</li>
            <li> I have decided to go natural recently and this hair dryer works very well for deep conditioning and roller setting.  I have a good amount of hair (past my shoulders) and this dryer gets the job done.  As some reviews have stated, this dryer is extremely hot and that&#x27;s just on &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; heat.  I never feel a need to set it on &amp;#34;high.&amp;#34;  It takes close to 2 hours for my hair to completely dry, but again it truly depends on the length of your hair (and how much patience you have...) I highly recommend ear protectors when using this dryer as my ears tend to heat up rather quickly.  You will also need to keep a towel around your neck as my neck heats up quickly and the tubing gets very hot...not a good feeling when it rubs up against your neck or shoulders.  I usually just make sure that I push it away from my neck area as I settle down.   I am able to use this dryer while seated on my couch or on a chair.  The dryer is very loud.  I do not have problems with the tubing popping out as some reviews have stated.  It has only popped out twice and that is because I was reaching for something...This dyer is very easy (and quite convenient) to set up and store away.  It can slide right under you bed, closet, cabinet, or on a shelf.  2 Reasons why I gave this dryer a 4/5: This dryer is extremely loud I wish the tubing was a bit longer to allow more flexibility and allow me to shift without it popping out  Overall, a great dryer that I would recommend.  (The dryer looks exactly like the picture listed)  1 year update:  The tube on the hair dryer is very annoying.  It&#x27;s even more annoying when it pops out of the cap and I&#x27;m unaware (it&#x27;s no longer blowing hot air into the cap and my hair is not drying).  I&#x27;m currently looking to change this hair dryer primarily because after close to two hours (granted I have thick hair) my hair is still very wet.  It&#x27;s very frustrating to spend 1 hour putting flexi rods (or any form of roller set) in your hair and not have the results you were looking for because of a hair dryer.  Being natural is a full time job and I really need a quality hair dryer that will give me excellent results.  I&#x27;m a mom of three and really don&#x27;t have time to waste.</li>
            <li> This is the best bonnet I&#x27;ve tried.  LOL  It is a riot to see yourself in the reflection of the mirror with this on, but I wanted to find a dryer for deep conditioning.  This is my second bonnet, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.  Most impressed with its large bonnet (plenty big for many jumbo rollers) and the tie that secures the bonnet.  It was a purchase I&#x27;ll use only once a month, but I&#x27;m glad I found one I&#x27;m happy with.  :D</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  My wife loves it and recommends it highly for anyone who sets their hair on rollers.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of the hard hat dryer, get this one. It is quiet and you can actually sit at your desk and work while your hair is drying. This dryer will dry your hair but not burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> ...but I absolutely LOVE this dryer. It&#x27;s portable and works very well, although I was leery due to some of the previous reviews. As other commenters have stated, the bonnet is pretty big, but I just tied it very tight around my head to prevent it from slipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this bonnet dryer after my Gold N Hot became damaged and generally un-useable. I was surprised by the size of the unit, the bonnet and the amount of heat this little gadget generates. I have shoulder length locs, very thick hair, and the dryer was able to finish the job in less than an hour on the medium setting. Very impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* I love the four settings. Each setting was noticeably different than the others, not just &#x27;named&#x27; hot or medium.&lt;br /&gt;* While the heat output was high, the motor was not as loud as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;* The bonnet was sizeable. Fit all my hair with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;* Storage on the unit was impressive. I like that the unit is very self-contained.&lt;br /&gt;* The bonnet to hose attachment was the selling point. This is what broke on my Gold N Hot. Instead of tabs that lock into the bonnet, this unit has notches on the hose that fit into a groove on the bonnet, making for a more stable connection and less chance of breaking those tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I wish the hose were longer&lt;br /&gt;The hose to bonnet connection needs some sort of locking mechanism to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come apart during use. That happened a couple times. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but it was a little bothersome at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Laila Ali put her name on a good product. I expect this unit will last some time, hopefully as long as my Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because it was very easy to use and effective. With the standard hooded dryer so much of the hot air gets out but with this soft bonnet dryer no air escaped and got my hair dry faster than normal.</li>
            <li> The hood doesnt stay up. Doesnt seem like the air is getting everywhere. Product issue not seller issue</li>
            <li> Heats up very well and drys my semi-long  hair.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the cord was short other than that it is an excellent bonnet hairdryer&lt;br /&gt;and very compact.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a wonderful and convenient tool to be used while im deployed given the climate conditions and very little access to a hair salon. It works great, the only downfall is that it is very noisy when in use.</li>
            <li> great buy very pleased</li>
            <li> I actually bought it for my elderly mother. Although nice and compact, she had a very difficult time getting the hose in and out of the main box.&lt;br /&gt;It has various settings but it was too hot where the hose actually attaches to the bonnet. For me the plastic bonnet would have been fine, For&lt;br /&gt;her, though, it was uncomfortable and the gathered plastic hurt her forehead. I did like the fact that when bonnet and hose are put in the unit,&lt;br /&gt;it really takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> Pros are it has four settings and a powerful fan.  Con is that it is SO loud!</li>
            <li> Works great. My only complaint is that the hose from the box to the bonnet is extremely short. The only way I figured out how to use it comfortably is to sit on the floor next to the bed with the box on the bed. The outside of the box unit doesn&#x27;t get hot in the 20 or 30 minutes I&#x27;ve used it, so I&#x27;m not too worried about fire danger. But, maybe next time I use it, I&#x27;ll put it on the dining room chair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so not happy with my purchase. When I first got it I was so excited because it is portable but when I first switched it on it was VERY LOUD... I ignored that, I read the directions and decided to use it in my hot oil treatment. The low sitting was very hot and the cool sitting was cool air and there was nothing in between!! I put it on and started watching YouTube when suddenly my eyes started burning and when I looked at the dryer it was smoking!! I wish I can get my money back</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is awesome, if you want a dryer that is portable and gets really HOT this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Works well but very loud.</li>
            <li> This is a really good bonnet dryer. It is very compact and nicely designed and most important, it drys the hair well. I love the size of the bonnet and the ability to move around unlike the traditional hooded dryer. The bonnet quickly attches and detaches if needed. It works perfectly for me as I sit at my desk and do work while my hair is drying. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable. Hot air leaks out the sides and burns your neck and ears. It gets the job done though</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer awhile back and have used it at least 3-4 times now. Though it takes awhile to dry my hair that&#x27;s understandable since I have a sew in installed. I like being able to be mobile while drying my hair so that makes it pretty worth while. I can see myself getting a great deal of use out of it whether my hair is in a weave or natural. The hose gets pretty hot too, but it&#x27;s a dryer so...</li>
            <li> I love my Laila Ali bonnet dryer!  I have short hair and I use it for deep conditioning treatments.  It heats very well and is durable.  It has a very large bonnet that can easily accommodate a wet set of long hair on big rollers.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and plan to buy one for a friend.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have purchased and used a hair dryer.  I am quite pleased with the general operation of the unit... other than I would have liked a 3rd choice in heat setting (medium).... the unit has cool or hot.</li>
            <li> This unit was to replace my hooded dryer of 4-5 years. The hood&#x27;s spring was broken \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; by Hubby. The accident gave me the perfect opportunity to try another soft bonnet dryer. Had one a few years ago but the cap split and I could not find a replacement. I LUV the convenience and portability of a soft  bonnet dryer. The Laila Ali gives me exactly what I need including comfort. It is hard to stay on the head if you&#x27;re doing something w/o rollers like deep conditioning because it looks like a hot air balloon in take off mode. Probably could have more elastic or drawstring all the way thru which might correct hence only giving 4 stars. The hot setting is not uncomfortable and gets the job done. I am African American with THICK (not sure of type) hair, currently transitioning, that usually takes 1.5 hours under a salon dryer. This took the same amount of time but I was in my recliner. BONUS! Noise level is about the same as any other dryer but I can have my ears out and hear conversation, TV, put in my ear buds and watch YouTube. LUV that the cap is large enough to fit over my head and the purple setting rollers with room. I&#x27;ll be trying with Curlformers next. Received timely and was in great quality. Unit is sturdy and has no slip/slide pads on bottom so if bump whatever it is sitting on it won&#x27;t slide off. I placed it on a TV tray table and it performed perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works as indicated.  Does generate some static electricity. Do not like lid latch.. seems like it will break easily.  Do not like on/off and heat setting locations.  Seems like controls should be on outside. Flimsy lid must stay open to operate.  Wd be better if it cd operate w/ lid closed. This would not be an issue if lid latch were more sturdy or had a reliable, strong hold-open option. Anyway, drying capabilities work fine, once you adjust bonnet on head properly. I recommend this unit if u don&#x27;t want to incur damage from blow drying your hair.  Needs to rest/sit on stable horizontal surface in order to operate.</li>
            <li> Does the job for which I bought it. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> Dryer is very compact easy to store vs. hooded dryer. The dryer aslo gets very hot, will burn the back of your neckand ears if you dont place a towel around it, very uncomfortable. The hose that attaches to the bonnet is very heavy so bonnet will lean to one side, which is kind of annoying. But dried my hair very fast. teh noise is loud but tolerable due to teh fast dry time.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!! I use it to dry my hair woth my curlformers on and it fits them on completely.  My hair dryer in 30 minutes which is fast because it use to take me about 2 hours. The only problem I have is when I try and try it off after using it for a while it won&#x27;t turn off. I have to unplug it :( but still a good buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because it is compact and easy for my granddaughter to use and store in her dorm room.  She loves it. She uses it to deep condition her hair and it does a fine job.  She recommends this dryer highly.  It also was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It work for less than a minute and since than I can&#x27;t get it to work. Very disappointed. And I thought with a fragile item like this they will bubble wrap it or something, alas, non, it come in a box with no fragile sticker nor anything to cushion it from damage.</li>
            <li> Works great for coloring hair brings color up real quick.</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews are correct.  So far, this product has worked for my hair.  It dries quickly.  I did have to keep it off my ears and the back of my neck because it got too hot-even on the medium setting. I would suggest you buy the ear protectors if you can find a good pair and keep a towel around your neck.</li>
            <li> It arrived superfast,already assembled .Works as described.I set it on the warm and thats usually enough heat for me.Cute little carrier case</li>
            <li> Comfortable and fast drying time! I also love that it is purple and so easy to travel with. Get this thing a better bonnet and it is definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Apart from the most fabulous shade of purple, this dryer has the power of an Ali punch!  Whether drying out my 3&#x27; long locs or just setting a few rod curls on the ends, this is the woman for the job!</li>
            <li> Loved the color. The cord was too short and had to sit right at the outlet and not move. I think something was wrong with the cap because it became unbearable hot where the hose was plugged into the cap. Nice try but no cigar</li>
            <li> didnt make me like drying any better.Is easier to use than your traditional hood. hose not insulated so it gets hot on your neck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable, efficient, and low-priced...and I love it!  It&#x27;s so much better than the one I used in the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is just what the doctor ordered.  I find if I counter twist the hose, and then insert it into hood, the hose stays in great.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer after being natural for two years. I got tired of having to wait for hours for my hair to dry after at twisting it. I wanted to be able to two strand twist my hair, sit under a dryer and be ready to go in an hour and this is what I got with this dryer. I love it and am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. I have shoulder length relaxed hair and I use it with my big rollers on the high setting. It takes about an hour and a half to fully dry. It takes some getting used to as you need to position it over your rollers so that the air circulates evenly. I love it 100 times better than my traditional bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I love my Lalia Ali bonnet dryer cause it does the job. It has multiple settings, adjustable bonnet, and a compact carrying case. I love the fact that I can set up shop to dry my hair where ever I choose. Unlike my old hard hat hair dryer this one is compact and can easily travel by fitting in an overnight bag or suitcase. The bonnet stretches wide enough for a head full of rollers and the pull string is long enough to double wrap and tie around my head for bonnet security.  The heat can become a little warm on back of neck but the cool feature fixes that also the flexibility to turn the bonnet from back to front and vice versa.  It&#x27;s a great addition to my natural hair styling products.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium-length, very thick and extremely curly. Without a dryer, it can take, literally, all day to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I wished this dryer had a medium air flow setting instead of just high and low. However, I can use it on Hot temperature and Low air flow and get medium results. It cuts down on drying time significantly, which is a huge plus. I also use it on low heat during deep conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to neatly package it away when not in use. My only minor complaint is that during the rare times I use the High air flow setting (because on Hot, it gets VERY hot and I don&#x27;t want to use that much heat for more than a few minutes), I really have to pull the bonnet down low so it stays in place, even with the chin ties. That&#x27;s not enough for me to rate this dryer down, though. I love it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this dryer for Christmas. I really wanted a dryer so I could do styles at home and not have to wait all day for curls to dry or sleep in curlers. I thought I wanted the hard top but this is so much better and he did all the research himself. Its super comfortable and easy to use. You pull it out of the box, plug it in, click the hose to the bonnet, put it on and tie it, then click on. No craziness. The motor is super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get hot. So I can watch tv or anything really while having it on the bed without fearing it&#x27;ll burn the house down. The bonnet is huge. I&#x27;ve used extra long/wide curlformers and flexirods; both fit great. My hair is super thick and below my armpit and it dried in under two hours. This is definitely worth the buy. If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth it or if you&#x27;ll use it, you will. It&#x27;s light weight and so compact. Definitely a great gift :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite birthday gifts this year!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have past my shoulders thick natural hair. (Thanks to Wen). And this is a huge asset in my hair care regime. It&#x27;s my moment to relax sip tea and while my hair is drying or setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot. But it has multiple heat settings. I simply adjust when needed.</li>
            <li> I put one in this and tell him to brush his teeth, use a blow dryer on the other.  Helps me move them out faster... will be useful until they can use hair dryers themselves. Wish the tube were a little longer.  Really cannot move very far from unit.</li>
            <li> Dazzled by the gift&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughters love the present.  Their thick curly hair gets very dry and difficult to manage, but since receiving this as a Christmas present it has made it easier for the girls to manage their thick locks of curls.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased that it was easy to use and came in a portable case. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Efficient and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This thing is just awkward. I reallly want to like it. I love Laila and I love purple. I don&#x27;t expect a lot when it comes to these things, but was still disappointed. The vent kept blowing HOT air on my neck. It was so uncomfortable, I had to sit at a perfect angle and cover my neck for it to even be bearable. It is now sitting in my closet collecting dust. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews on this item; this thing is too noisy!!! I decided to wash and dry my hair after my kids went to bed since that is my quite time to do work and other stuff- bad idea!!! This hair dryer woke everyone up at 11:30 at night because it was so loud! It is also very flimsy in my opinion as it tips over very easily. I really don&#x27;t know what all the rave is about with this product. &amp;#34;Gold &#x27;N Hot&amp;#34; is a much better product</li>
            <li> Pros: compact, everything in one place, all items fit into case, it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair into a tangled mess, the low setting is plenty heat......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: kinda too loud for me</li>
            <li> It is a good product, for the price! But from time to time, the bonnet pulls out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer, except for the connection to the actual dryer from the bonnet.  It&#x27;s a tad loose, you have to play with it to connect it.</li>
            <li> The settting for this dryer is LOW and HIGH.  They both work well, but it would have been helpful to have a medium setting.</li>
            <li> Very convenient love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The conair I purchased did not last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Oh gosh, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  But I did break the hinges on the lid.  Product still works great.  I just have to be more careful, with my clumsy self.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and compact enough so that it can be stored in a small space. I personally used it for deep conditions. Only reason it has 4 stars is because I have only used it once. But it worked very well and my hair felt super moisturized after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have long locs. After re-twisting or a wash this is perfect for getting every single loc dry and set in all types of styles. The bonnet is really big. I tie it twice around, but if I put rods to curl my hair it fits perfectly. It&#x27;s a little noisy but I think all of these bonnet dryers are noisy. It is pretty and its just the right size. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this bonnet sauna/dryer, I use for many things: deep conditioning oils, add heat to the rollers, after wash creams &amp; lotions.. etc. The high heat setting is super hot, I never use it, I don&#x27;t know how can anyone resist it &amp; for what use they designed it on that much heat!! It may be more resistible when having rollers on, will try it on high it &amp; see. However.. the low heat is pretty hot too, I get so hot after several minutes, I switch to cool for a minute or 2 then return to low heat till I finish my treatment time. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my lady. She loved it She says it works great for her.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work all that great. But boy was I fooled. I use this for my deep conditioning treatments. The only problem I have is that the bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay on my head and I have to put a towel or something heavy to keep the bonnet from coming off my head on high. Other than that, it works great. My daughter now uses it too!</li>
            <li> Love this! My jumbo rollers fit with no problem. I can easily put it away with no issues compared to a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that I heard about this dryer. I can&#x27;t even remember how I did, but it was at some point near the end of what seemed a futile search for a bonnet dryer that was sturdy (e.g., hose doesn&#x27;t fall apart after 1-2 uses) and performed well. I&#x27;m not sure why it was so hard to meet that criteria, but Laila did it and then some. Been using this for a few months now. I no longer dread setting up and sitting under my hair dryer.  Reliable and hassle-free, THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I purchased this bonnet dryer after reading reviews on blackgirllonghair.com. It works exactly as advertised and shortened the drying time for my waist-length locs from three days to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer about two months ago.  I bought it so I could reduce the use of a curling iron on my hair.  Have used it regularly, including taking it on a trip for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The bonnet is nice and big - goes over big curlers.  It all fits back into its case easily and is convenient to travel with, or carry around.  Gets very hot (also a con) and has very high speed, so it dries fast.  The hose is easy to connect and disconnect from the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Gets very hot,  burns your ears if you don&#x27;t cover them.  There is no &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;, even though there is a setting that says so.  The two heat settings should be called &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;very warm&amp;#34;.  The electrical cord is quite short, so if you travel with this dryer you&#x27;ll need an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably would look for a different brand when shopping for a replacement</li>
            <li> I just received this dryer.  The concept is good since everything is in one unit and it&#x27;s portable and lightweight.  It gets CRAZY HOT!  The problem is that the cord keeps separating from the bonnet.  I&#x27;m sitting under the dryer now and every time that I move, the cord detaches. So annoying!  I thought that I could walk around with this, but I&#x27;m stuck sitting in one place.  I&#x27;ll keep trying and submit an update,</li>
            <li> I really liked it but does have some issues. Just broke after 6 months and I used couple times per week.&lt;br /&gt;1. But  the heat from the lid melted the bonnet&lt;br /&gt;2. The bonnet is hard to adjust into the lid coming off often.&lt;br /&gt;3. The air scape easily ( you can cover up with towel or something&lt;br /&gt;Overall is ok for the $, saved me some $ in beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it is very reliable and convenient!</li>
            <li> This product probably would work but the heating hose kept falling out of the machine when I tried to dry my hair on rollers.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap and it is very noisy.  Sounds like it will disintegrate before much time go by.  Air flow sucks.  Nothing good to say about this other than they should stop making it.</li>
            <li> Great so far. The hose can be a pain however and I find it best to place the hose connected to the front of the cap and allow the hose to rest on my head. The heat from the dryer cap can also be too much for my skin at my nape when I leave the hose connected at the back. Every time I place the connection at my nape, the hose tends to disconnect. I think the hose connector could have a more secure mechanism to stop the hose detaching so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the multi heat settings and I tend to use medium and the high is simply too hot for my skin. I also love how the air flow is distributed evenly over my head and so I get an even drying for my short hair. The great thing is that the dryer is also grat for deep conditioning and works well even over another steam cap.</li>
            <li> I just love this dryer!  It is one of the easiest dryers to maneuver where u need it to be.  I bought it to use to do deep conditions on my hair but I found other uses for it as well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was sending electric shots every time I touched it on my head. To be honest it didn&#x27;t feel safe at all ...&lt;br /&gt;so I got rid of it ..</li>
            <li> When I first received the bonnet dryer, I was incredibly frustrated with how the hose continuously became detached from the bonnet (like previous owners had warned). I had to stay perfectly still, and I hated it. UNTIL, one day I just decided to twist the hose a little harder when I attached it to the bonnet, AND IT STAYED! It actually snaps into place. I can once again move my head like a real person while drying my hair. I do wish that the hose was longer, but I can understand why they opted to make it the length that it is... It is a little loud so I usually read while drying my hair instead of watching TV...Lastly, I love the size of it. I was deciding between this bonnet dryer and the hard top dryers. SO glad I picked this one. dries my hair nicely and stores away so easily. And it&#x27;s excellent for travel. I&#x27;m going to the beach next week, and it&#x27;s small/light enough that I&#x27;m actually considering packing it in my suitcase to help me keep up with my hair while on vacation. Couldn&#x27;t do that with a hard top dryer! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as drying, I think that the product does an excellent job. I have natural hair so I use the dryer to partially dry my braid or twist outs before bed to make sure my hair is completely dry when I wake up, and I can avoid frizz. The Cool, Low, Med, High setting are actually for the amount of heat that you want, not the pressure that you want the air to flow.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!!! The best drier I have ever used!!! It dries quick, and my hair is silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is large enough for all my rollers (17 in all, 8 of them are lg, 4 med, 5 sm)!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical to purchase this item at first but I have dreadlocks and I needed a dryer that I can use at home. This dryer is good but not great. My problem with it is the hose to the hair bonnet, it doesn&#x27;t fit well or it doesn&#x27;t snap and stay in place. Other than that it works really well. Its portable, light and it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well.  It dries my mid-length hair in an hour which is fine.  I can sit still and watch TV with the sound way up for that long a time - no trouble.  My one disappointment is that the bonnet isn&#x27;t a big bigger.  I use Conair&#x27;s Velcro Rollers and it is a really tight squeeze getting the bonnet on over them.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a great hooded dryer. I have used hooded dryers for over 20 years and this is close to beauty shop quickness drying.  I purchased it about a year ago and it dries my really thick hair quickly (about 20 to 30 mins) Second, the hood adjusts from the back (which I like) and is comfortable but be careful not to entangle your hair in the strings because it will pull it. Ouch! Third it is space efficient and easy to clean off hood and case with mild soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me say although I love this dryer, I am not sure as to why the hose disconnected from the base. I usually wrap the hose in its spot and roll the hood up and place it into its spot and close it and put away. I usually take it out just about the same. In my opinion, I was not too rough with the hose and I am not sure why it came apart so I just purchased another one. I will do a follow up review after another year to see if the same thing happens. I am leaving as 4 star because of hose disconnect problem. I think they should make the hose sturdy enough to not come apart so easily because it cannot be replaced or fixed easily. You will have to purchase a new unit :*(</li>
            <li> The dryer is very convenient to move around, it dries very well, and it is easy to attach and put up.  It does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> Because this dryer isn&#x27;t really anything to write home about! I bought it from another catalog company for about $10 more. Truly wasn&#x27;t or isn&#x27;t worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;It really does nothing spectacular.  My hair wasn&#x27;t any different after my treatments and drying.  I should&#x27;ve returned but I kept the darn thing...</li>
            <li> I used this dryer two times and the hose that attaches to the dryer melted and detached from the dryer.</li>
            <li> I have a small full service salon studio and my clients prefer this over the hooded dryer!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great product, have not tried it yet. I purchased for drying braids under weave. The unit is self-contained and cute.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Too noisy, not as flexible as I thought. I wish I bought the table hair dryer.</li>
            <li> works great. so convenient</li>
            <li> Temperature-wise, it is the best soft bonnet dryer that I have ever had.  A lot of them really do not get hot enough to dry my very thick hair.  The problem is the bonnet itself.  It is not constructed well, and it is almost impossible to secure it around my head.  It is hard to tighten/loosen the (not so) adjustable band, so the bonnet either slips down my forehead, or hangs loosely in the back.  If it were not for that, it would be great.</li>
            <li> Stylish (love, love, love the purple color!), Portability is a good feature, Heat generated by the dryer is excellent!  My dryer has the following settings Off, Cool, Low, Medium and Hot.  I put on a plastic conditioning cap, my ear shields, and used it on the medium setting to deep condition (DC) my natural hair. The HOT setting was too hot for me even with my ear shields on!  I also used a Diane microfiber towel around my neck to protect my skin.  The hose fit into the bonnet well, just seated it in the cutouts and turned it about a half turn until I heard it click.  My only cons are that it&#x27;s LOUD, so I couldn&#x27;t watch TV while using it; therefore, I turned to my trusty Kindle Voyage to get some reading done instead. :)  My other cons are that the hose gets very hot so be careful what you lay it on or near. Also, the hose isn&#x27;t very long; however, because the case stays relatively cool I can just place the dryer on my lap while I am using it.  All things considered, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It keeps pulling off of my head when the air is on</li>
            <li> Very good dryer I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great dryer. I&#x27;ve used it several times. The bonnet is large. My dryer has cool,  low, medium and high. This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> It is so convenience. I carry it everywhere in the house when drying my hair. Go from the table to the computer to the room. Dry my hair all around. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> So far, so good- but I ony used it twice. You have to think about where to set it up, but once you have got your spot ( with a table nearby to hold the motor near to your head ( the hose is not very long) it is quite comfortable and I could work at the comuter while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This thing saves my life.  Portable and right amount of heat on high or cool settings.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this dryer worked well until piece came apart.from bonnet on first use!!!!</li>
            <li> It has behaved very very well up to now. The only slight problem is that sometimes, when you move, because of the heat, the tube turns in the socket and comes apart from the bonnet (sorry if my English is not good enough to describe this precisely). What other customers say about the heat on your neck and ears is true. I simply put a towel around my neck and pull my ears out of the bonnet. But the advantages of drying the hair and keep your hands free compensate everything. Strong, well built, great buy.</li>
            <li> I loved this compact hairdryer.  So easy to use..  Everything fits inside the purple case. The bonnet was certainly large enough to wear with rollers.  The three settings were perfect.  I started out with the hottest selection to dry and then turned it down to the middle selection as the hottest selection became too warm.  Best of all I could turn it down to the lowest selection and cool my hair off.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer for my rollersets and ot heats up pretty good. There are 4 different combinations of heat settings. There is Hot Low, Hot High as well as Cool Low and Cool High, which are more or less like the fan setting on an AC—it just blows air. The bonnet that I recieved was black, which I loved and it is large enough to accommodate rollersets, Flexi Rod sets and whatever your heart desires. There is also an adjustable drawstring which helps you fit it to your head. Like other reviewers have noted, the Hot High gets really hot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for an extended period of time. I usually keep my setting in Hot Low and then blast it to Hot High for the last 2-5 minutes to ensure that my set is dry. It only takes me 50 minutes to dry my hair in rollers, which is almost 20 minutes quicker than when I get my hair done at the salon and so far I have had no issues with it. The heat spreads evenly and I never have to worry about shifting the bonnet around to fully dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a consistent Amazon Prime customer and shop almost weekly on here and this by far is my first 1 star review.  I just received item today, inspected the box and item inside and placed it right back in the box because it isn&#x27;t what is advertised.  I didn&#x27;t even try it yet because it&#x27;s going back to Amazon immediately.  The item I received appears to be cheaply made with horrible quality plastic.  The bonnet and hose are colored white instead of black.  This item does not look like what is advertised on the video review By IsaReviewer on May 7, 2013, on the first page of this item.  Ughhh, I am so disappointed.  Amazon is shipping a replacement item which I am skeptical in receiving.  I really want this product, but I want the one that is being advertised everywhere.  We shall see what I get for round 2.  I will update this review upon receipt of the replacement item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 4/3/2014**  I received my replacement today as promised and I am completely satisfied that I received the dryer as pictured.  First thing I notice was the packaging is completely new and when I investigated the actual dryer I smiled because it was what I wanted :)  The item is completely new, no marks, no discoloration or scratches compared to the first dryer I received.  The quality is even a lot better.  I have updated the rating to 4 stars from 1 star due to my initial experience.  Once I try out the dyer I may update this review again with my hands on experience.  Thanks for rectifying my complaint Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the portability.  I do wish the hose part was longer , and that the hose and cord were retractable, but I guess it would then cost more money.  Everyone was right when they said it got hot on their necks. Next time I&#x27;ll have to use a towel.  It dried my hair really quick however, and I&#x27;m happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Ideal to allow conditioner to penetrate you hair. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to use when I deep condition, and it has worked perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not great.  The cap doesn&#x27;t fit tight and it&#x27;s very noisy plus the heat from the hose melted the cap and I had to duct tape the hose back on after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and value. 800watts didn&#x27;t seem enough , but it is. Very storable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, but I have a hard time make it right enough without it blowing off my head. I have to angle it right, but it does it&#x27;s job wonderfully when adjusted.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it weekly for hot oil treatments at home. Excellent quality components. However, the air doesn&#x27;t really come out cold when on the cool setting. it&#x27;s more like cold is warm and hot is actually hot. The hot setting is not too hot though so it&#x27;s okay. Overall, I am happy!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the hose to stay in due to a loose fit and kept getting frustrated. Decided to give it away as a gift instead. Maybe they&#x27;ll have better luck than me.</li>
            <li> I think the first reviewer is confused. In 2 places on the box it says there are 2 settings: but there are are actually 4: 1) High - hot (good for the first 20 minutes); 2)low hot (good for the next 10 minutes then 3)cool (a. high or b. low) for the  final finishing. There is a DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE between high and low hot settings unlike other dryers that have 2 hot settings but are equally hot. This is a well-engineered dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this dryer last week and used it Sunday, Nov. 25th on my recently colored hair - my hair (thick and shoulder length) and scalp never looked (or felt) better. as for its features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - the motor is powerful without generating a lot of extra heat&lt;br /&gt;Second - the hood is ROOMY and COMFORTABLE and accommodates the largest of rollers&lt;br /&gt;Third - this is the most important - this dryer does not create uncomfortable hot spots which burn your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally - the case is well made, stylish and a joy to use ( I LOVE the color) - everything cools off quickly and can be replaced without bulging or popping out of their original storage places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent dryer for the money. I strongly recommend it. I just noticed the other 2 types of dryers and may buy one of those as a back-up.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It&#x27;s so easy to use and compact for good storage. Have used once a week for the last month and my hair is so silky and soft. So glad I took chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li> Cool hair dryer with bonnet.</li>
            <li> Force of air weak, won&#x27;t inflate cap.  Not unusable, just takes forever.  Made me wish for the one I HD in the sixties!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dryer but was disappointed for the following 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1) The hose keeps coming unattached when I&#x27;m using it.  Even if I turn my head only slightly, it comes loose and I have to stop the dryer and re-attach it.  This may occur several times while I&#x27;m using it, which adds to the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  The cap does not fit well over the largest rollers.  I have long hair and like to use a dozen jumbo curlers.  The cap doesn&#x27;t fit over them so I&#x27;ve had to move down to medium size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;(3)  The combo on/off switch and temperature control malfunctioned the first time I used it and is now stuck, so the unit cannot be turned off.  I have to unplug it to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I had high hopes, but now I&#x27;ll be returning it and getting a hard had dryer instead.</li>
            <li> I have this dryer in the older configuration (black bonnet) and I used to like it.  I was using it for deep conditioning treatments and roller sets as I started to grow my hair out from a pixie cut.  I have relaxed and color treated AA hair. As my hair continues to grow I am noticing that this dryer is just not powerful enough to dry my hair in a timely fashion, mainly because it is only 500 watts. I am now looking into getting Laila&#x27;s hood dryer because it has 1875 watts. The compact nature of this dryer is great and I love that there are storage compartments for the bonnet and cord. I also like the handle. it&#x27;s like Laila thought of everything with this dryer. I usually use the cool setting, I wish it had a medium setting (perhaps the newer model does?) because the cool setting is too low and the hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp on the top of my head. I just can&#x27;t stay under a bonnet dryer for hours until my hair is dry. I look forward to getting a hood dryer with faster drying time, however I will still use this dryer for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bonnet dryer in March and it came with a black tie-on bonnet that would slip off easily unless you tied it super-tight.  Now I see that they&#x27;ve completely revamped the product, which annoys me, because the dryer itself is great, but the bonnet is AWFUL.  So now I&#x27;m stuck with a great dryer with an ill-fitting and unwieldy bonnet.  That&#x27;s why I give it three stars.  I&#x27;m going to call the company (Helen of Troy) and see if they&#x27;ll let me exchange the unit if I can&#x27;t get one of the new-styled bonnets.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 1/8/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;within a week after I posted the above review, I contacted Helen of Troy about the bonnet problem and they told me to send the unit back and they&#x27;d send a replacement.  I got the new dryer about a month later and it&#x27;s the one pictured in this listing (the LADR5604).  Unlike the old dryer, this dryer&#x27;s bonnet is elasticized and has a toggle tightener.  The bonnet is comfortable and easy to use - but CONS:  The air strength of this bonnet dryer is MUCH LOWER than the earlier model.  So it takes longer to dry my hair.  Also, the unit itself is much cheaper in quality.  The bonnet hose - while conveniently stored within the chassis of the unit, is difficult to extract and really hard to compress back into the unit.  Also, when the bonnet heats up during use, the bonnet hose sometimes snaps out of the groove that attaches it to the bonnet.  So don&#x27;t expect your bonnet to stay on the hose if you&#x27;re doing an extended wet-set at medium heat (I haven&#x27;t tried it on high heat because if it does it on medium, it probably does it sooner on high).  I&#x27;ve ended up having to hold the hose at a funny angle to keep it from popping out of the bonnet hole if I have to sit under the dryer for an extended period of time.  Having to do this kinda defeats the purpose of sitting under a dryer in the first place!  Sure would like to read my book or multitask with both hands instead of having to use one hand to hold the (hot)bonnet hose!  Sad.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a pretty decent dryer with better heat than the basic Conair bonnet dryer.  I wish Helen of Troy hadn&#x27;t cheapened the quality of this unit - a better bonnet for the old unit would have been awesome.  I really liked the old unit, save for the craptastic bonnet....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 9/29/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet on the replacement model is cracking at the elasticized edge, and therefore snags your hair when you put it on, AND scratches your face while in use.  WHY CAN&#x27;T SOMEONE MAKE A DECENT PORTABLE BONNET DRYER?!?! If this bonnet had a soft (maybe terrycloth?) elastic headband, it would have been much more comfortable to use.  Calling Helen of Troy today to beg them to send me a replacement bonnet.  Really peeved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 11/12/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Helen of Troy in October and learned that the bonnet isn&#x27;t covered by warranty, so for $6.00 (plus $3.50 shipping), I had to order a new bonnet.  Still really disappointed in this dryer, but sad to say - it&#x27;s better than a Conair bonnet dryer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 12/9/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, so clearly I&#x27;ve had the dryer for 2 years.  I bought it in late March 2014.  My views about the bonnet are the same - it&#x27;s garbage.  I&#x27;ve had to buy replacement bonnets three times in two years.  The bonnet material around the elastic cracks and splits due to hardening - probably from a combination of the heat and possibly hair products or water.  I use my bonnet hair dryer almost every day for about 15 minutes of drying time.  The dryer works really well, but it is CHEAPLY MADE.  Here we are in December 2016, and today the ENTIRE HOSE DETACHED FROM THE BODY OF THE DRYER.  I was like - what the heck??  Could SOMEONE put a LITTLE MONEY into making a product that will LAST FOR GOSH SAKE????  So I&#x27;ve had to push the hose back in and wedge it in the tube.  Don&#x27;t know how much longer that&#x27;ll last and will call Helen of Troy next week to see about a replacement.  I was looking on Amazon for other options, but the reviews on the Hot Tools and the Andis dryers aren&#x27;t any better.  At least this one is only $33 (now it&#x27;s that price.  who knows what it&#x27;ll be next week).  I say BUYER BEWARE - IT&#x27;S A CHEAPLY MADE DRYER BY A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN HAIR TOOLS.  WHAT&#x27;S THAT TELL YOU?  I&#x27;m disappointed that today&#x27;s companies can&#x27;t make a reliable, well made portable bonnet dryer.  My mom had one that lasted at least 40 years.  This thing is cheap.  I&#x27;ve reduced my review to one star.</li>
            <li> Great bonnet dryer...except the body is to light fall over way to much....but overall it&#x27;s a great product, light and easy to store.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!! DOES IT&#x27;S JOB. Not overbearingly loud. Cord could be a little longer. Bonnet with some elastic maybe for a more secure fit. Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> This portable Hair Dryer is one of the prettiest ones I&#x27;ve seen. When it arrived I was pleasantly impressed by the design and packaging. However, I was left disappointed after I actually used the dryer. Once you turn the dryer on, you&#x27;re fighting to keep the bonnet on. It was uncomfortable and a awkward to wear. Therefore, my positive impression was short lived. I haven&#x27;t used it since because everytime I think about using it, I get arm pain flashbacks. What&#x27;s the point of having a beautiful umbrella if it doesn&#x27;t sheild you from the rain?</li>
            <li> I def needed this hair dryer and love it. Straight out the box it was impressive. I&#x27;ve only used twice but it does the job great. Going to use tonight actually. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like the case it comes  in because there a place for bonnet ,hose and it will not get damaged and it  can conveniently  be stored under bathroom sink. the power level really heats up if it on high  or low switch it blow med-warm air and cool is cold if  place on hi switch and if on low it blow cool air</li>
            <li> This dryer looks great, portable for travel and dries my hair in 45 minutes.  heat doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a regular hood dryer!! That is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I have not roller set  hair in over a year because my old bonnet dryer broke due to storage issues! I dreaded buying another - then saw the collapsible dryer from gold n hot and thought about buying it - then I came across this dryer with its great reviews and decided to give it a try. I love this dryer - dried my hair fast - the bonnet was big enough for my jumbo rollers - and storage is fantastic, fits on my shelf. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was not sure that I would like this product but I love it. It dried my hair in less time that expected and all of my large rollers fit&lt;br /&gt;in with no problem. I have very thick hair which has been chemically treated and this dryer worked like a charm. It is worth the&lt;br /&gt;cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a while now, and its still working just like when I first received it. The bonnet is large and will fit over extra large rollers. Only problem I have is that the top purple cover will keep closing over the dryer, but that&#x27;s to be expected so i&#x27;m not taking any stars off for that. All in all great product, one of the best hair dryers i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the most is how quiet it is, the compact design and the cool setting is perfect to keep from putting too much heat on my hair!  It also dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago and feel in love the first time I used it! Usually I have to sit under the plastic hooded dryer forever and I could never really get comfortable because I had to have it on a flat surface which really limited my options. But with this bonnet dryer I can sit it on the arm of the couch and watch TV with no problem. Plus it dries my hair evenly so I can be under the dryer for less than and hour and my hair is dry. Which is a huge bonus for busy college student like myself. Plus it is cute and compact so it stores easily.</li>
            <li> Using the dryer for the first time.  Easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t see the hot/cool setting on the left.  So....I thought that this will never get my hair dry.  Had it on high cool.  The minute&lt;br /&gt;I put it on hot, my hair started to dry really fast.  Bonnet was easy to place and held all curlers without a problem.  Like it alot.  Now can do other work while drying.</li>
            <li> I like the detachable hood. It gives you the ability to move around without having to take the cap all the way off. It gets a bit too hot for me, and there is no middle ground. Its either low or high, hot or cool. I always have to take breaks because my ears and neck are burning. I usually wear a plastic cap and then a head scarf under the hood to cover my ears. I have only used it for hot oil treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a hot cap dryer, this one definitely does the job.  I just wish that there was a middle setting, and that there was more ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: This is my first cap dryer so, I really cannot compare this dryer to any other dryer. Maybe this is how all cap dryers operate. Overall this is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to give this product a 5 star rating.  However, after 2 uses the hose tore away from the air output and now it&#x27;s useless.  I did have a hard time with getting the bonnet to stay on but I managed.  I tried looking on the website to see if there were replacement parts but no such luck.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer.  It is hot and does what it is supposed to do!  It works - love it!</li>
            <li> Works well but I had to keep attaching the hose to the bonnet. Every time I moved it came apart.</li>
            <li> I love the soft bonnet dryer. It dries my hair fast but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out by using too much heat.</li>
            <li> Holy cow! The only thing that keeps this from being perfect is the tube length. I&#x27;d love to have an even bigger bonnet to cover my 3 in rollers. The packaging is compact and easy to put away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to store in addition to drying my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again!</li>
            <li> not hot enough, takes for ever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Quickly dries my hair in rollers in 20 min or so. Hose that connects to bonnet comes loose from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have to first say I have thick hair... after 3 hours under this bonnet dryer my hair was not dry.. I was looking forward to this purchase because I am active and wash my hair frequently and wanted to be able to style my hair.... I am really disappointed in this dryer</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer for the most part except for the hood keeps sliding off of my head and I end up keep pulling it back on.  I have tried tying it several different ways and it still slides off my head.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this hairdryer has been upgraded and perfected since some of the video reviews done earlier. The Bonnet is tighter fitting and the case with the opening lid is no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Bonnet fits snugly, a wet set on medium and large rollers dries thoroughly within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;I love the compartments for storage of the cord,hose and bonnet. Great slimline.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 5 stars if it were a bit quieter, though. Quite noisy.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this to others.everyone in the house.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;after using the product for a little over a year I find&lt;br /&gt;1. The loudness will get on your nerves and irritate everyone in the house!&lt;br /&gt;2.The hose keeps falling out of the bonnet, even after locking it in initially.The slightest turn of the head will cause it to drop out UNLESS THE SETTING IS ON COOL AND THE BONNET IS STIFF..&lt;br /&gt;3.The medium setting is fiery hot and burns your skin. One needs to stuff tissues into the edge of the bonnet to avoid burns. The next lowest setting is very cool. It is almost like there is something missing in the temp control design.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect when your doing hair colors at friends houses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom because ever since she watched a soft bonnet dryer on Tv, I don&#x27;t even know how many years ago, she wanted one. She is very happy with it, and that&#x27;s all that matters to me. This device is very light, easy to carry around, easy to store, easy to use, easy to clean and something she will definitely make me repurchase.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I love it. perfect for setting you curlers.</li>
            <li> I am going to review this product a second time. I used it once to do a hot oil treatment on my hair. I like that the dryer gets really hot and the oil treatment penetrates my hair. My gripe with this product is the bonnet. I find that it is very large and even though I  adjust it to my head by pulling on the strings it has some difficulty staying on. Due to the fact that the circualting air in the dryer is strong. I am going to try it with a roller set and then I will make a final decision on this product.</li>
            <li> Love it !sometimes the hose comes attached but it&#x27;s easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> Works well but I wish the hose was longer.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a bonnet dryer that had a true cool setting.  This one&#x27;s cool setting is almost hotter than on hot.  Also... the lid broke off during the first use.  Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works really well, is surprisingly fast to heat up &amp; made my hair super soft. The only this I would change is I wish the hose were a bit longer. The case seems a bit cheap, so I have no idea how long it will last but I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect so many different reviews. I must say my long locks dried great. It does get hot. But I learned to turn the bottom to the top of my head spreading out the heat and that dried it faster. Do wish the cord was longer. But all and all great buy!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  It is large enough for my jumbo rollers and heat really hot. It is simple to use and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I received dryer, and didn&#x27;t open it until about a few months later and it didn&#x27;t work.  I can&#x27;t return it because I failed to test out the product when I first received it.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!  I just gave away money.  MAD!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does dry well, but it gets very hot on the high setting, and there are only high and low, and no moderate setting.</li>
            <li> I may be jumping the gun slightly by offering up a review after only three uses of the product (maybe I should wait and see how the dryer holds up after a few months or a year), but I was so pleased with the results I thought I&#x27;d give one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This baby does the job.  I have very long (waist length), thick and coarse hair that I always set in twists or braids after washing.  I used to let my hair air-dry, and the natural drying process could take days before I could take the set down if the weather was inhospitable.  Now, when I wash and braid or twist my hair and pop on the dryer, my hair is dry after only 45 minutes.  It&#x27;s a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very well constructed.  It comes in a durable plastic case which houses the drying mechanism, and the dryer nozzle, bonnet and plug have their own tidy compartments.  The nozzle attaches to the bonnet very easily and securely, and the bonnet itself is very thick but flexible.  I&#x27;m not sure what the material itself is -- maybe some kind of thermal heat resistant silica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two temperatures and two speeds, so you have four drying options.  The hottest and highest setting doesn&#x27;t strike me as being especially hot -- some other reviewers have found the hot setting uncomfortably hot, so it might just be my particular unit that doesn&#x27;t heat up to the level that others do.  I&#x27;m very comfortable with the level of heat that I get, though.  It dries effectively and I&#x27;m confident that my hair won&#x27;t be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very big head, so the bonnet size is perfect for me.  It ties up snugly and I don&#x27;t feel any air escaping from anywhere it shouldn&#x27;t once the bonnet is secure (there are ventilation holes throughout the bonnet).  The drawstrings tie the bonnet very tightly, and they are very long, so someone with a smaller head than mine might be able to loop the strings around and tie it around the top to make sure it holds in place if they are unsure that the bonnet will hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet can be slightly awkward to put on if you have very long hair and are drying it loose.  It took a bit of maneuvering to get all of my braids/twists into the bonnet without any of them peeking out, but I eventually found a method and it&#x27;s not a problem now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose attaches at the base of the bonnet, and even though some other reviewers have had a problem with the hot hose touching their necks and backs while it was in use, I have found that the ballooning of the bonnet once turned on causes the hose to stand away from my body and not touch me at all.  Maybe the product was re-engineered after the earlier reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer can be a bit loud, but not as loud (I don&#x27;t think) as a standard hair dryer.  I&#x27;m not distracted by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am as happy with this bonnet dryer as I think I could ever be about any bonnet dryer.  It&#x27;s comfortable, drys my hair quickly and safely and it was totally reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  20 minutes and my hair is dry . . . and somehow it seems to make my hair very shiny.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier or more convenient.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is incredible. It&#x27;s not loud at all so if your drying your hair u can watch T.V. at the same time. Also it&#x27;s portable you can bring it any where u want. It&#x27;s also not too big but just the right size. I usually put a small stole near my T.V. And plug up the dryer. The quality is great it drys your hair fast but doesn&#x27;t burn you like most dryers. But I recommend putting a hair net or something under if you have product in your hair. The great thing about this hair dryer it has a head dryer so instead of having to hold a dryer to your head u just tie this one to your head. Also the amazing thing is,is that the tube that puts heat in the head dryer is insulated so it won&#x27;t burn the tube or even feel hot! Over all this is an AMAZING hair dryer I HIGHLY recommend getting this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dryer was purchased as a gift for an elderly woman who is confined to bed.  The dryer allows her to have her hair washed, set and dried while in bed.  The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers and the hose is long enough to reach from the bedside stand.  For a small machine it puts out very good heat and airflow and it runs reasonably quietly.  The higher heat setting gets quite hot.  The hose attachment to the bonnet is a little awkward for a person lying on a pillow, but that is a special situation and you can work around it.  The machine is lightweight and compact, works well, and is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I Packed this item for  a 7 day cruise to roller set my hair. My hair was dry in normal time. My style came out perfect. This is a must have item for roller setting hair while traveling.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo6W33EIYVSQ0G]]A comprehensive review of the Laila Ali Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer and demonstration. I love to use it for styling and for heat treatments.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great. It&#x27;s light and easily transportable and tucks away without taking up too much space. The settings and design are simple but not cheap. It is worth every penny! I first purchased 1 for myself and then I got another for my sisters. My mother wants me to get her one too, so I will be purchasing a 3rd sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Motor blew within 2 minutes of starting.. I returned it and will NOT replace with this product.  I would not have given even 1 star but it was needed for writing the revew</li>
            <li> when you could find a decent heating cap or hair dryer for those occasions when you just want to curl up with a good book (now on your ipad) and be nice to your hair.  No longer.  This thing is OK however the cord is very short - so get your snacks and supplies ready beforehand.  Also, it advises that you not &amp;#34;place it on flat surfaces&amp;#34;.....Ummmm....where would  you like me to place it?&lt;br /&gt;Did the job, could have done it better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I don&#x27;t mind sitting under a dryer.  This gets hot quickly.  Everything arrived in great condition.  I have used it several times and had no issue.  If I were to change anything, I would make the hose a little longer.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! A lot more mobile than the hard plastic type!! So glad I decided to purchase this item!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer bonnet was just what I was wanting for conditioning my hair.  I love that it has 4 heat settings and the bonnet would be big enough to fit over curlers if I chose to do so.  It has a nice long hose so I can move around some without pulling it off.</li>
            <li> I use this for my home deep conditioning sessions, and it works like a charm.  It takes under a minute to plug up, attach the hose, and flip on.  Great price as well.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this for two reasons.  I needed a large bonnet to deep condition my hair and I love the color!  It is so compact and easy to store away.  Product performed as expected and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  If you are looking to deep condition and/or dry your hair I think you will be as happy as I.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the reviews were spot on.  I adjust the hood for my ears and tuck a towel for my neck and the heat is not an issue.  This dryer is compact, quick, and for short hair, it gets the job done!  A great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I brought 2 one for me and one for my neice that love it also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the overhead, not the bonnet.  The portable overhead used to dry my hair in 45 minutes.  This thing takes FOREVER to dry my hair, no less than three hours.  It&#x27;s a good backup, but for thicker hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3JGDKMUMKQVLX]]PROS&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it looks. The various parts fit easily back into their slots and the whole dryer is compact. I was surprised at how large the bonnet is. I had a full head of 2 inch rollers on and it fit over them quite well. There was one reviewer who said that when she put the bonnet on it completely disrupted her rollers. Well, any bonnet would disrupt your rollers if you don&#x27;t secure the rollers by tying them down with one of those large black triangle net things. Since I do that, I had no problems with it disrupting my rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE DEAL-BREAKER CON!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem with this dryer is that the whole perimeter of the bonnet does not cinch (see video), only the back part so I can&#x27;t get a good tight fit.The elastic strings don&#x27;t pull tight enough so the bonnet starts to slip away from the front a bit. In addition, the hot air shoots out around the sides and burns your ears and all around the back of your neck. Putting a towel around the neck doesn&#x27;t help because the burn starts to happen at the edge of the bonnet, kind of like just inside of the bonnet so a towel wrapped around the neck does not work like how it does when you use sit-down dryers. I tried stuffing a towel or fabric into the areas that burned but that didn&#x27;t work either. So, for example, the back of my neck would burn so I would stuff a towel under the base of the bonnet to catch the air at that location but then the air would shoot out up by my ears. Occasionally, I would find a delicate balance that would allow me to tolerate the configuration of the bonnet and towels/fabric stuffed into the base of the bonnet but it meant that I couldn&#x27;t really move around at all. Even if I needed to reach for something nearby or turn my head to look at someone it would completely mess the whole thing up. This meant that the time I had to spend under the dryer dragged on for an inordinate amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had a solution to the problem of the heat shooting out, but I was sadly mistaken. I took a long piece of satin fabric that I sometimes use to tie down my hair and I wrapped it around the perimeter of the bonnet, kinda like if you were putting on a bandana. However, ensuring no hot air blew out and burned me was hit or miss, usually miss. Furthermore, I had to tie the scarf so tight that it felt like I was cutting off circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got aggravated by it and went to pull the strings and one just popped, which means the bonnet won&#x27;t close and I will have to buy a bonnet attachment. I know this hot air shooting out thing is a design defect because I had a soft bonnet hair dryer back in the day and I never had this problem--ever. Now I have to go spend $17 to buy a replacement bonnet because the shoelace thing popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. my mom bought one these dryers as well and she has the same problem as well.m of the heat shooting out, but I was sadly mistaken.

            <li> International buyers please BEWARE. We were disappointed to find the supplier (Amazon site) provide an item to a international location without so much of a mention that the unit was only fit for use in the USA (110 volts). It cost us an additional amount of monies for power transformers just so we could make use of it. The practicality of this portable device has been totally lost as the power regulators are heavy.</li>
            <li> Convenient and dries my hair quickly.  The bonnet is large enough for my big rollers.</li>
            <li> linda racist with 3 start having use this item heater yet but its what I wanted so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to like it</li>
            <li> Bought this for deep conditioning my hair since the caps that are sold for that purpose just don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This one is portable and works great for this purpose and also for drying with curlers (kinda old school but I think it is better than the high-heat curling irons/flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a cool setting to help cool down my hair which is critical when deep conditioning so you don&#x27;t wash away all the natural and added oils and conditioning treatment</li>
            <li> It works OK. Was hard to get over my biggest rollers and was difficult to keep tight on my rollers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best thing I can say about my purchase is that the hood fit over my largest size Goody rollers (the big pink ones).  Other than that, it was a flop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dryer would not work at all on the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting (making it useless to set the curl once it was dry) and the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and \\&quot;warm\\&quot; settings were exactly the same -- incredibly hot!  It was so hot in places that I could not use it long enough to dry my hair.  It kept burning my scalp in spots and so I had to shut it off for minutes at a time to let my head cool.  And sadly, no air seemed to get to the left side of my head at all under the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me that most of this was probably just due to a wrong connection made at the factory and everyone else here seems very pleased with their purchase of this dryer so I&#x27;m just putting my experience out there in case it helps someone else.</li>
            <li> This bonnet hair dryer is the best dryer I have ever purchased by far. I absolutely love the color  - I am a purple fanatic. The dryer is so neat and compact and puts out more heat than any dryer I have ever purchased.  I usually put my hair dryers settings on high-- but this dryer gets so hot that the low or medium settings work just perfectly for me..  Thanks Laila Ali.  This product rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and compact. Fits anywhere and not bulky at all. I was surprised at how hot it can get.</li>
            <li> Works well. Light weight. Multiple speeds to,adjust for your needs. Fits both my daughter and I well.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It fits my head perfectly. It isn&#x27;t too tight, but it also is snug around my head. It&#x27;s perfect for deep conditioning, and for drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with my purchase.  I had done my research before buying it and thought that it would be a good purchase,  but boy was I wrong. The unit refused to turn off after the first use.  I thought it was on a timer or something so I left it running to see but eventually I just had to unplug the it. The switch refused to go to the off position.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is great! If you are on the fence just buy it! My only complaints are that the hose unlocks from the bonnet time to time which can be annoying and the hose gets extremely hot (duh)/ The cool setting is very cool if you use it prior to any other setting. If you use low heat then switch to cool, it&#x27;ll cool down a little but wont be a true cool feel. I never use the high setting because the medium setting is super hot already. I recommend using a towel to cover your shoulders. You must adjust and tighten the bonnet to avoid the air blowing onto eyes and ears but its not a big deal. I use this mostly to dry braid and twists for braid outs and twists outs, deep conditioning, and when coloring my hair so that color takes in better. Overall this is totally worth it! It would be 5 stars if the hose would stay on better</li>
            <li> I went natural and needed to get a hood dryer.  I looked at the hard bonnet type hood dryers and then I found this one.  I really love this one because it is more mobile than a hard hood dryer.  I can watch tv and make dry my hair without having to be stuck in one specific position.  The only complaint that I have is that sometimes the hood can fly up if you don&#x27;t make sure to wrap the strings around the front of the hood too to tie it down.  Also, it can be irritating if you are sensitive in the back area of your head toward your neck.  Other than that, it does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works fantastically for my thick frizzy prone hair, mid-back length mane. Hot is HOT. Bonnet well sized even for big rollers. Very pleased and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very hot dryer works great. Will recommend!</li>
            <li> The best dryer ever.  Previous reviews on this product really helped my choice.  I sent this to my daughter in college.  She can study opinion her room or even the common room.  It works great!  Awesome product in quality, portability and size!  We love the color too.</li>
            <li> This is a serious hair dryer. I have long locks and I can roll my hair and still have room in the huge bonnet. My hair will usually dry if I keep the bonnet on for 3 or 4 hours off and on with the curlers in. (It would usually take that long with shorter hair not in rollers with other dryers). I would have given 5 stars, but the parts are really cheap and I&#x27;m afraid that without handling with kid gloves, both the bonnet and the dryer tubing will break. I don&#x27;t know what to do when (not if) they do. :((</li>
            <li> This is my third bonnet hair dryer in 20 years.  The first one was a Conair similar to this model but was discontinued when ionic heating grew in popularity.  My last one was the Gold N&#x27; Hot. I will compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laila Ali&lt;br /&gt;Power and heat - 800 W, 4 heat and flow settings - high is too hot for me, but medium works well with just the right amount of airflow so I don&#x27;t spend two hours drying my hair.  I have a short, pixie cut and my hair is naturally coarse and very thick. It normally takes about an 45 minutes to dry thoroughly even in the salon. It took about 50 minutes with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet size/fitting - The bonnet is large and is adjustable by elastic drawstring.  It should fit a roller set but I no longer set my hair so have not personally tested this on this dryer.  However, the Conair I used to own had a bonnet this size and accommodated a full roller set for me with ease.  This bonnet is perfectly adjustable to fit my head.  Some air does leak around the ears and nape but I put cotton strips against my ears and neck to seal and protect my skin from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - It&#x27;s pretty loud.  I don&#x27;t know one that isn&#x27;t though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features- Very compact, stands upright easily on a firm surface, and the cord storage cover is able to be closed during use allowing for convenient use and storage.  While drying my hair, I can put it on my night table and sit (or lay) on my bed.  One of the negatives is the short hose.  The hose port has to be facing you and since the vent is on one side, it limits your seating relative to the dryer&#x27;s position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold N&#x27; Hot&lt;br /&gt;Power and heat - 500 W, 4 heat and flow settings however you control with two switches - High and Low, Hot and Cool.  High-Hot dries well but I still need ear and nape protection.  However, Low-Hot decreases the air flow significantly making it take a lot longer to dry than drying on the medium setting of the Laila Ali dryer.  I don&#x27;t really see the need for High-Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet size/fitting - The bonnet is large and is adjustable by what looks like a long shoe string for sneakers.  There is no way to completely secure it for small heads or short cuts like mine.  I wrapped the string around twice and tied it in a bow but would still find the bonnet slipping off when I had the flow setting on High.  Individuals with larger than average heads or those using it for roller sets will find this bonnet a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - Similar to Laila Ali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features- Very compact, stands upright easily on a firm surface.  However, the cord, bonnet, and hose are stored in the middle and are all accessed by opening a hinged cover.  The vent is also under this cover so the cover needs to be kept open during drying.  This is nice for storage but makes it awkward during drying and limits your placement of the dryer.  This dryer is able to be mounted to a wall and doing so would remove this negative factor.  The hose is longer than on the other dryer making the positioning versatile despite the limitations from the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waiting for the motor to go out on my Gold N&#x27; Hot dryer since I bought about 6 years ago because of the annoying heat settings and the awkward cover but it still works.  I&#x27;m replacing it because the hose tore from the inside of the connecting piece and I find it easier to replace the dryer than to try and get the hose fixed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she seems to really like it.  Her only complaint is that she thinks it is a little too hot on her head.</li>
            <li> my 92 yr old mother says it is perfect, very comfortable</li>
            <li> Stopped using it because the black bonnet was a drawstring and kept sliding off. I&#x27;m looking for the replacement bonnet, which has elastic , but it is not available by itself. Please make it available or let me know where I can purchase it alone.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer it&#x27;s pretty handy and I&#x27;m able to move it around the house with no problem. When I put it n &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; it gets very hot but then I adjust it to the medium setting. So to me that&#x27;s a good sign because you don&#x27;t have to worry about this dryer not getting hot enough. I use it every week or week and a half and my hair is conditioned well and soft. The price was just right for it and I was able to save some money.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I just received this item and incredibly there is no bonnet in the box. If they get me the bonnet in a timely manner I will upgrade this review. What a hassle to get the item missing a major piece and now I&#x27;ll have to wait several days for a replacement...argh.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon on Saturday and had my replacement on Monday! Excellent service, easy return because all I had to do was print the label they emailed me and put the product back in the box and give to UPS man.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer works great for my weekly deep conditions! I Also you it to deep condition my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer!  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and I still love it.  I wash my hair at night, and sit under the dryer while I&#x27;m watching TV.  I have to get the dryer part away from my ears and put the TV on super loud - but it works.  Improvements that would be nice:  Quieter, longer hose from bonnet to dryer.  Small things I can deal with, but a great dryer, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I love these bonnet dryer! It is amazing. There are 4 settings, low, high, cool and hot. That&#x27;s is all you need. It does get alittle hot sometimes but nothing that bad. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it works great and get really hot!  Could never find a compact dryer that worked this well before now.</li>
            <li> This Bonnet had the best reviews for a great price, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m using it right now as we speak! It&#x27;s super quiet, I can even watch TV while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair :-) My mom&#x27;s old dryer bonnet was really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bonnet in a pretty purple carrying case. It&#x27;s easy to use right away and shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only my first time using it, but I love it so far!!!</li>
            <li> i brought this for my mother in law ,she loves it because she can set on the couch ,because she is unable to stand.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this bonnet I was NOT impressed. I actually wanted to return it, but the returning process seemed like more hassle than it was worth. So I decided just to try it out and if I really didn&#x27;t like it I could sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO glad I gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What turned me off was the bonnet: it seemed too big for my main purposes of usage (as a deep conditioner heat tool). It is perfect for ladies who do rollersets or the like, but I&#x27;m not there in the hair game yet lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put on my DC, a shower cap, and hooked up the machine. It comes just as the stock photos picture. It is very simple to set up and use, takes seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settings: High/Low, Cool/Hot. I used it on High/Hot. It wasn&#x27;t very hot to me and I thought it was lacking until I finished the DC session. When I took the bonnet off, my shower cap was holing on to so much heat!!! It took about 10 minutes for the shower cap to cool off (I was testing to see). That was impressive to me. When I took the shower cap off, my hair was so soft and wavy. When I rinsed, my hair was like butter!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in this process for two DC sessions (one 30 min protein treatment before the wash, one 30 min moisturizing treatment after the wash). Both sessions with the bonnet were a success, and I am sold. I will try it with rollers next when I try my first rollerset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;- I use a shirt or towel on my neck. The heat bears down on my neck, ears, and eyes. It doesnt bother my ears and eyes, though.&lt;br /&gt;- The bonnet is kind of awkward at first. I had to play around with it for a minute to get comfortable. I use the strings to fasten it under my chin. It works best that way for ME.&lt;br /&gt;- My fist day I used it for 1 hour total. It is built well and I can tell will be able to handle plenty more sessions. It is made of high grade plastics. I placed it on a chair and sat in my gaming chair while on my laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item. I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.mend this item. I love that it is compact, heats very well, is attractive, and helped me improve my dc sessions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I deceided that I would start coloring my hair at home due to the cost of salon coloring. It worked very well. I had no issues with it al all. Of course I have only used it one time, so I guess time will tell if it lasts.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this the first time I used it.  The fact that there were no real instructions was a disappointment. Had I not read reviews here, I would never have figured out how to open it!  The bonnet (white) was not as big as I expected based on description.  It did fit over my rollers, and stayed on for the hour I used it.  I also used a towel on my neck.  It worked well, and I alternated heat settings during use.  Overall, for the money it was a good purchase. These items are almost non-existent now!  I hope it works for me as I use it more, for it is convenient to be able to put rollers in wet hair and dry it well within an hour.  I had no issues with cord length, and the hose stayed attached but I did not move around much, and can see where using it while active might cause the hose to disengage itself.</li>
            <li> The hose gets extremely hot with use and burns the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Easy to use! Perfect fit for my hair rollers. It dries my hair as if I was in a Salon and works good for deep conditioning my hair as well! Also easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer personally i could use a longer hose for mobility but all things considered i give rate on the scale 1 to 10 i would give it a 9. I absolutely love the style and the purple cover.</li>
            <li> A five-star product all around. I love the deign of this dryer. Somebody gave it a lot of thought. It is easy to unpack and easy to pack. It heats quickly and evenly.Definitely worth more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product which I also use for heat treatments for the scalp.  It is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> bonnet is a bit large but works great. I have only used it once but get hot enough w/o burning my ears. great product so far.</li>
            <li> I really like my drier it&#x27;s very light to carry and it works great. What i think could be better is that the heat is not equal in the entire head, so you have to turn the bonnet in order to the heat reach the back or the other side.&lt;br /&gt;The heat is appropiated and its very quick.&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy whit my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer daily to dry my mid-length thick hair. I use large curlers and my hair is  always dry in 20 minutes. I like that there are four heat settings (although I usually use only the \\&quot;High/Hot\\&quot; setting). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product, wish I&#x27;d ordered one earlier.</li>
            <li> The attachment to the bonnet keeps on falling while the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  I ordered it as I will be having surgery on one of my hands soon and I find it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very nice; lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Three temperatures plus a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> I find this holds hair styles better than the curling irons. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but this works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer!  Wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I have honestly had vacuum cleaners that were quieter than this thing.  Unbearably loud.</li>
            <li> Like the dryer. Disappointed because the picture you are seeing on this item, WAS NOT the picture I seen when I first decided to buy the item. The one I seen was the first edition and not the one in this picture. But overall it&#x27;s a good dryer, kind of loud but i dont expect dryers even at a beauty salon to be quiet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.received quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the older model where the air pump keeps falling out of the bonnet. Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> I needed some form of a hooded dryer and I really like this. Like the other reviews this dryer gets hot. I find that medium is a good heat that is sufficient. It fits all of my hair with perm rods in it. I also like that it&#x27;s portable. It is fairly loud, but no louder than any other hooded dryer. I like it because I can either work in my office with it or watch TV. I find that the drawstring closes tightly as well. I use this about once a month or so and have had it for several months without a problem. I have shoulder length - Type 4A/B hair and I have both thick hair and thick density.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4C African-descent hair.  As I continue to gain length, I wanted to stop with the manual drier and opt for a healthier way to use heat in taming my coils.  This product is my solution.  I have notably thick and dense hair.  This dries my most of my head when in rollers in about 45 minutes or so.  I notice that toward the center of nape so hair remains damp, but not &#x27;wet&#x27;.  For this small section I use a regular blow drier.  I recommend.  It&#x27;s not the best, but it is far, far from the worst.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I need a diffuser to maintain the curls while trying.  I put little clips in my hair then blowdry.  This gives me just a little lift and keeps my curls in their (nearly natural) position as my hair dries.  I was concerned that this would smush my hair and asked that question here of people who&#x27;d used this in the past.  Most people said that the bonnet was so big they didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem.  Well, I&#x27;m sad to say that this bonnet completely flattens my hair on top while I&#x27;m wearing it.  My curls look terrible.  And, it takes a really long time to dry.  I suppose if you have curlers in and the bonnet rests on the curlers, that&#x27;s OK.  But, if it is resting on your hair, it will compress it.</li>
            <li> This bonnet does the job, gets hot and I like the temperature settings.  However, it&#x27;s difficult to completely close the bottom and hot air escapes. My hair would dry quicker if the bonnet was able to keep all the heat inside.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is so compact and easy to use. I really like the design of it and it is easy to travel with. The bonnet is large enough for a big roller set and I like that it has multiple settings. I used it to deep condition my hair and was happy that it wasn&#x27;t too loud so that I could use my headphones with it and it wasn&#x27;t too hot. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Quiet operation. Easy to store and the bonnet works perfectly. Best bonnet hair dryer on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great. It gets hot and drys my hair (which is short) really fast. The only complaint is which other have stated is when you turn it on the hood can come off but I have learned to keep it on by using the draw strings and tying it around my chin and wala it stays. The hood can be a little difficult to adjust to your head size but once you get the fit just don&#x27;t undo it for the next use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. i previously had a tourmaline hard bonnet dryer that I paid $150 and loved, had it for  about 4 years and it broke recently. I bought this and it does the job just the same. This dryer dries very quickly to my surprise. The only negative the cord can get hot on your neck but if u put a towel over your shoulders it would be no problem. This is a great price and the large bonnet is great for me since I have thick hair. Everything fits great in the case and it really dries nicely.</li>
            <li> Works well but the chemical plastic smell is awful. I have noticed that all my past bonnet dryers had a similar smell.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is very bulky, heavy and unmanageable.  Was disappointed.  Have used this type of dryers over the past 50 years and this one did not compare as to comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 6 weeks now and overall it&#x27;s pretty good.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a bit fussy to get the bonnet snugged up tightly enough.  However, once you have it on and turned on, the air inside kind of holds it up from falling down around your eyes.  I saw some comments about fit problems, but if you turn it so that the air is coming at the base of your neck it works best.  Also, the ties are not for tying under your chin as another reviewer wrote.</li>
            <li> This is the dryer I have been looking for. It gets hot but does not overheat. The bonnet is big enough to cover big rollers. The hose is strong and does not twist up. I love it. My only complaint is that it is not portable. I would love a shoulder strap so I could move around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to layoff off my flat iron.  This drying helps tremendously.  Less drying. Less frazzled.  That&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Hair Dryer works great....however the heat only blows in one spot so i just rotate it to cover other areas</li>
            <li> on time and no problems</li>
            <li> The Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer has come in very handy. It is quite efficient, however the drawstring that tightens around the crown can take some getting used to. Aside from that...I love the product. It&#x27;s not too loud and it&#x27;s compact. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It functions just as I had expected and the portable case is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;No disappointments and I would buy it again..</li>
            <li> The bonnet falls off - my husband says I have a peanut-sized head - and the hose could be a bit longer, but it works well and my hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> i ordered it on Saturday, recieved it on  Tuesday,earlier than stated.  I am using it on&lt;br /&gt;thursday, it s perfect.it get hot all over and its not to loud.  My best purchase ever.</li>
            <li> Perfect for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love how compact and portable the dryer is. Like the fact that it has 3 temperature settings and the bonnet and hose can be stored right in the unit itself, so no problems with losing or missing parts.The only 2 issues I have 1) it&#x27;s extremely noisy no matter what setting 2) very difficult to keep the hose attached to the bonnet. Once you put the hose on the bonnet you turn it to lock it in place but there is no locking mechanism or anything to firmly secure it in place so it keeps coming right out. Once you get it to stay in, you have to sit very still and don&#x27;t move otherwise it will come out.</li>
            <li> Good dryer. I got this dryer for my mom  in December 2013 because  after her eye surgery she had issues with the regular dryer which exposed her eyes to too much heat. This dryer is perfect since the heat is kept off her face. The uses the dryer at least twice per month and so far so good. No complaints as yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, but it dries my hair well</li>
            <li> It came really fast and it is great quality</li>
            <li> It does the job I bought it to do, mostly.  However, the hose will not stay attached to the hood.  Every small twist of my head and it pops out.  It is a design flaw.  There is not a proper &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; to hold it securely enough.  The company should redesign that part.  I make it work for me by keeping my movements to a minimum and holding the hose to my body with my available arm.</li>
            <li> Difficult to position cap on head. Other than that, pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> Awesome and convenient!</li>
            <li> Ive only used it a few times but its great - Dries evenly and I can dry my hair anywhere in the house</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product as I&#x27;ve never purchased anything like this before. But if you&#x27;re on the fence, BUY IT! I have naturally curly hair and using this soft bonnet dryer has been much more gentle on my hair than using my hand-held hair dryer with a diffuser attachment. It may take a bit longer, but I can be hands free to use my computer or read. It&#x27;s almost like being at the salon and I love that I can take the dryer anywhere in my house.&lt;br /&gt;I did set the dryer precariously and it did take a tumble (where I broke the case lid), but no damage to the dryer whatsoever. I recommend this dryer wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> I put coconut oil on my hair then a shower cap and then sit under the dryer for about 20 minutes.  The bonnet fits well and the heat is evenly distributed and my hair comes out shiny and healthier.</li>
            <li> This was of the best purchases I could&#x27;ve made!! My hair is natural and I enjoy being able to sit or lay down with the bonnet.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is pretty awesome. Definitely a great buy. I have shoulder-length hair and use rollers to dry it. I was scared this bonnet wouldn&#x27;t be big enough or wouldn&#x27;t dry well (I&#x27;ve tried a few bonnets before and only ONE I actually liked... but there has to be good ones out there...right?... Yup♡).  Ideally I would like the bonnet a bit bigger BUT it really dries my hair very well... faster aaand with less heat than a blow drier! That seems contradictory but I swear it&#x27;s true. On my first use I swore it couldn&#x27;t have dried my hair in the time my blower gets the job done (I didn&#x27;t feel like it was circulating air as much as I thought it should) but my hair was suuuper salon head-drier dry...wow.  I&#x27;ve used this hair drier about 5 times now. You have to be careful putting the bonnet on with rollers but I&#x27;ve never messed them up while putting it on.  I would like the bonnet heat cord to be longer. It seems like all good hair bonnets have this problem but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. You just have to place it close to you. If the heat cord were longer I would have given this product 5 stars.  I love having both my hands free while drying and if you really want/need to multi-task its easy to twist off/on the heat cord from the bonnet. The cord has never come off on its own either :) (That would be annoying)  The 4 heat settings are awsome and if you want to crank up the heat the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting will do you justice. I don&#x27;t go past the medium setting (I&#x27;m sure those with longer hair use the higher setting)  If you are unsure, give it a try. I choose to try this one due to its great reviews on several websites and I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase ^_^</li>
            <li> Product works as described.  I&#x27;ve had not problems with it.  As with all of these types of dryers, the hose is just too short and I feel tethered to an electrical outlet.  However, this wasn&#x27;t a surprise and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this hair dryer once since I had it.  I love this little dryer.  Its perfect and I can do other things while drying my hair.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Performs just as stated. Great for deep conditioning treatments. I have natural hair and was looking for a bonnet hair dryer that would dry my wet sets and twists. This fits the bill perfectly and I love the color.</li>
            <li> The product is great just like described. Shipping to Europe was amaizing fast!!! Plus for this. I used it weekly for my hair treaments and setting up. I love the convinience and it is really powerful.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY THING which I wish they could look at it, temps gets really hot even the cool settings... ?</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient dryer. I bought it after being dissatisfied with my Conair dryer. I do find that this performs much better than the Conair dryer. I have very thick hair and I&#x27;d need to dry my hair for about an hour to an hour and a half with the Laila Ali dryer. After an hour and a half with the Conair dryer, my hair was still considerably wetter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this dryer could be a bit uncomfortable on the high heat, high speed setting. You will need to place a towel around your neck, and perhaps pull a bit of the towel up and under the bonnet to ensure maximum protection from the heat. Sometimes I also alternate between the high speed setting and low speed setting because the heat also feels uncomfortable on my scalp. But overall I am satisfied with my purchase and if I&#x27;m in a hurry and need my hair to dry quickly, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it so compact and light weight. Best of all it leaves my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is quite handy, small and powerful.  I can take it anywhere, use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must point out that this is my second one. The first one fell of my lettle daughter&#x27;s desk and wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  It was a child sized desk, so it wasn&#x27;t high but still the dryer wouldn&#x27;t work.  I sent it back to Amazon and they replaced it quite promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying not to let this one fall because I don&#x27;t know if the first one was defective or if they are that they weren&#x27;t built sturdy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  Always wanted one.  Was never sure.  I am very happy I finally got it! Now I can lay in bed and take a nap while I dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I have only used this with my deep conditioner for 30 mins. The cap is very very large and will for sure cover a good size or amount of rollers. They have low &amp; high as well as cool. You will look quite weird while wearing it hehe but overall i find it very good and have found my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for  hair dryer that is easy and  compact for the longest time and I have finally found it!!!!!! for the first time I am winning!! I really love this hair dryer. The only thing is i have a small head and when my hair is drying the head piece slowly slides off. I found a way around his by just tightening it like usual AND bringing the string around to the front of my head and tying it to the front holding down the edge of the cap keeping it from sliding off. but its very strong and it gets hot!!! which I love, I don&#x27;t like them being cheap with the heat.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair dryer with a bonnet.  I would have given it 5 stars except for 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;1)  It would be much better if the hose were at least 1 foot longer.&lt;br /&gt;2)  For some reason, I have trouble keeping the bonnet secure on my head.  I have long naturally curly hair.  I don&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;with rollers or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does a great job of drying my hair without torturing my curly hair.  My hair ends up dry not fried ! :-)</li>
            <li> Got this for my elderly mom who couldn&#x27;t get to the salon any longer.  And it worked really well, moved to her wheel chair instead of having to get her to a certain height for other hair dryers.  SHe liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I have dreadlocks so I bought this dryer to help set curled styles and I must say, it is definitely a good product.  The bonnet is large so you can fit a lot of hair even with rollers.  However, it gets HOT...a little too hot when it&#x27;s on high so I strongly suggest using it on low heat!  It may take longer, but you could definitely burn yourself with the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use. I can move around and still have the unit connected which helps being a multitasking mom.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer it works very well, just how I expected. It has hi and low velocities and hot and cool air, so I can use it how i feel more confortable. the cap ajusts well on the head.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer once so far for a deep conditioner. I love the hot and cold settings but the bonnet is hard  to stay on. I just couldn&#x27;t tighten it enough, which was one of my concerns when I purchased. I had to try to hold the strings down so the cap wouldn&#x27;t blow off. I&#x27;m hoping that when I roll my hair that the rollers will make up for the extra space and the cap will fit perfectly then. Otherwise I love the color and case and small enough to pack away nice and neatly, and the settings definitely are high enough to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Not too big and only used occasionally. When I do use it, the heat is fine and it fits over my large rollers.  The only drawback is that I can&#x27;t walk around with it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and it has been working for me when I do my 2-strand twists. I would recommend this product for all the thick, naturalistas out there.</li>
            <li> I use bonnet dryers to set my hair with plastic curlers.  A healthier method to using direct heat.  This dryer is on par.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this dryer. It has worked really well and is very easy to use. It is compact and very efficient.</li>
            <li> For my sister. She says it works great. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that. It brought back memories. I&#x27;m very glad that some things just do what they are supposed to do without having to have electronic dials and digital displays. I remember when simple was good and just ...worked.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this dryer, after seeing some of the reviews. But, looking over the other products available, it seemed to be my best bet with regard to cost and portability. I must say that the reviews on  how to use the different heat and speed settings were very helpful. I&#x27;m enjoying it so much! I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair and have to wash and deep condition every week; being able to do this in the comfort of my living room is really great and has been worth the money paid for the dryer.&lt;br /&gt; The little bit of the pessimist in me won&#x27;t allow me to give it 5 stars yet tho&#x27;! Let&#x27;s see how it holds up over the next few months, and maybe I will review my rating!</li>
            <li> Before buying this dryer, I read the reviews. All of the expectation i had for this dryer were met. It is light weight, drys my hair fully. Has very good heat quality. I would recommend this to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I do cellophanes on my hair and my moms. So I can pack this up and take to her house. It&#x27;s got 2 settings and the low is still warm enough to use if the HI is too warm for you. Also use this for intensive conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> The dryer works as its suppose to!  You may need to place a towel over your shoulder because it tends to get hot (just like the hairdresser). Hey, for $40 it does the trick without being bulky to store.</li>
            <li> Just received this product through fed ex and I have to say that visually I&#x27;m in love. Its sleek, small, but sturdy. Nothing in this product seems flimsy at a glance. I like that the whose and bonnet are both black where as in the picture they&#x27;re white. The bonnet is huge which I&#x27;d prefer since I have thick, long hair (almost at my waist) and I&#x27;ll need to use XL rollers. I have yet to use it but so far so good on the visual side. I&#x27;ll give a second review soon once I actually use it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great!  The bonnet is big enough to fit big curlers, it gets to a pretty high heat setting. It is also a nice travel size. I took it with me on a weekend getaway, it is very easy and fast to set up, then pack away.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice product, does what it claims.. I have very little hair so I have to be careful because on high, it does burn my scalp (I have to brush it evenly so no scalp is showing.  I love that it has high, medium, low and cool settings. I do have to wear a thick headband under it because the heat hits my ears and does burn a bit. I also use a small towel on the back of my neck for the same reason. I knocked off a star because the tube that goes from the machine to the headpiece,  is wayyy to small, which is inconvenient if you are applying your makeup (moving around) while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> My Wife&#x27;s hair is hard to dry.  I don&#x27;t know why.  This product gets a lot of happy use by her.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It gets the job done.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I was surprised that the bonnet does continue to cover your head/hair and doesn&#x27;t slip up while drying.</li>
            <li> too difficult to get the hood on; very awkward with the hood and the hose. maybe it&#x27;d get easier with practice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law.  She had a stroke and is unable to do her own hair but my sister-in-law washes and sets it for her.  The dryer with the bonnet was perfect for her!</li>
            <li> It works great, but the tube is way too short.  It really limits being able to do anything else while drying.</li>
            <li> I have used Gold N Hot dryers that have lasted for at least 5 years for more.  I decided to change to another brand so I bought this dryer in Feb. 3013.  It looked good and worked fine for 6 1/2 months or so. Then. it just STOPPED working in August 2013!  In the middle of drying my hair it stopped and nothing I do will get it to work again! Of course, I can&#x27;t get my money back because the refund, return time frame has expired.  I called Amazon.com Customer Service and the rep, so named Catherine, in the Philippians (instead of an unemployed worker in the USA) was supposed to send me the manufacturer&#x27;s info so I could contact the company.  Well, she NEVER DID and I can&#x27;t find the manufacturer&#x27;s name on the internet. Piece of junk, I lost my money! Be careful if planning to buy that&#x27;s all I can say.  Mine may have been the only defective one... but so may the next one off the assembly line.</li>
            <li> Used the dryer one time---had not even thrown the box away--Ready to use it a second time, pushed the switch, and it did not turn on. Worked great the first time. Returned it and waiting for refund.</li>
            <li> works great, just what I thought it would be. Just like the 70s, it brings back memories and dries my hair well, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to replace an old collapsable hood dryer that was no longer working for me in regards to space.  I have owned this dryer for about a month or so and have used it 3 times.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  As other reviewers have stated, the hood is very roomy and I did use it when I was also using &amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34; with no problem.  I also like that everything fits neatly into the case and it takes up very little space when storing and using.  I find I can easily sit it next to the couch and continue doing other things. My old dryer needed a very particular arrangement to work which left me sitting quite awkwardly as I couldn&#x27;t move.  While I&#x27;m not doing yoga while using this one, I find that I can still work on my laptop, read and generally move about with ease as the dryer offers more flexibility.  As for the noise, it is a hair dryer, so I&#x27;m not expecting it to be whisper quiet.  I can still watch tv or listen to music without adjusting the volume to the max or using headphones.  The four heat settings are great.  I generally use it on low or cool simply because the medium is very hot to me and I can generally only take it for about 10 minutes.  So it may take longer to dry my hair, but because I&#x27;m able to still do other things, I don&#x27;t mind as much.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  I hope it lasts for at least several years (my old one lasted for about 10-so fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> This is very compact. It is sometimes difficult to keep the bonnet attached to the hose. It dries well at lower heat settings as the higher are very hot.</li>
            <li> The dryer works very well!  Gets extremely warm, so no problem with getting your hair dry in a reasonable amount of time!  The 2 annoying problems, but can be easily remedied is 1, the product is designed in a slim style and you have to make a decision as to whether to stand it up and because it is lightweight has a tendacy to fall over. I am now laying it down with the air flow vent facing up.  I usually lay it stacked on top of a sturdy box and that on top of a TV tray so that in front of me, I have another tray situated to either use my tablet and or use this as a perfect time to do my nails since I am seated for at least 30/40 minutes. The other downfall is that the hood has a screw like piece that locks into the hose but easily falls out when trying to get comfortable while drying.  I found that by sticking a very thin pick, think the tooth of a comb size, mine is actually a plastic spear used to stir drinks or spear olives onto, so thin it fits perfectly into the slot to lock the hole that the lock cap wants to fall out of.  When I finish drying the hair I pull it out as I do not want it to puncture the actual dryer cap.  So if you are annoyed by this, just do a little experimenting and you can make this work. My pick as a triangle head with a pick body and I broke it to be about an inch in length and it is the triangle that is actually holding it on lock down.  Hope this helps as this problem was very annoying.</li>
            <li> Love the hood, and the compact size.  It is loud, but does the job on my locks.  However, it wasn&#x27;t long before it got stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position.  The only way to turn it on and off is with the plug.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes time I between beauty shop visits wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have a big head and this dryer works perfectly for drying my locs. It took a while to come, but It was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I use my soft bonnet dryer for hair treatments and for roller sets.  This soft bonnet is very large and fits my large size rollers just fine.  I also have long thick hair along with a large size head. I am happy with the dryers form and function.  It is an attractive purple and black with Laila Ali&#x27;s name on the case in white.  It is compact and everything is easy to pack and put away. The hair dryer comes with hot or cool and high or low option. If you want high heat, use the hot option with high blower and it gets pretty hot. Use the low option and it is nice and warm. If you use the cool option, using high gives a stronger air flow and the low option would be a lower air flow.  I don&#x27;t know what the longevity it is since I have only had it for about six weeks.  If it breaks down in a two years or so, I still I would have got my money&#x27;s worth.  I don&#x27;t use it often only about twice month if that.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in the newer model! Two years ago I wrote a five star review for this dryer.  The only thing I like about the newer version is the bonnet. It has elastic all around the opening, is fuller, and the material is not as stiff as the original. However, the high heat is too hot, the motor is louder, and the slimmer case needs to stay in the same position while I&#x27;m drying my hair. With the older model I could sit close to the television and hear it when using the dryer on low speed. Not so with this model; the motor noise is the same on all speeds. I don&#x27;t like pushing the bonnet and hose into the case for storage after each use, so I just leave them out since I don&#x27;t plan on taking this case on trips. Next time I buy a bonnet dryer, I will be trying another brand.</li>
            <li> The connection from the hose to the hood came off after my first use.  Now I have to fix that.  I wish the hose was longer and that the hood had an elastic hood, like a shower cap.  But, it does do the job for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out my new hair dryer.  I have to say,  this product is amazing.  Easy to use and the storage is fantastic.  It is different than the one in the video as the case does not open.  It took me a minute to figure that out but once I did it all made sense.  The hose pulls out,  twist it then pull it.  There is a small compartment where the hair bag (bonet)  and cord is located.  Connect the bonet  to the hose,  plug  her up and turn her on..  Ladies,  it does get hot so be careful,  cover you neck.  If you where earnings like I do,  I recommend you take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on you hair length and thickness,  you will dry quick.  I have short hair.  So I wrapped it and dried in 30 mins...  I love this dryer,  the only down side is the wholes disconnects if you move around to much so be careful.  Fine a comfortable spot and relax.  The dryer will do the rest. ..</li>
            <li> this replaced an old hard bonnet dryer that crapped the bed after year sof faithful service.  I decided to go with this one becuase it is much easier to store.  it is not as efficient as the big one but i guess that is to be expected.  i really have to tie it very securely or it will just fly off when i turn it on.  and it does seem to get particularly hot at the hose part of the hood.  But i love that i can get my hair dry while on the couch watching TV, albeit very loud TV.  it is so much more comfy than the old faithful</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It is so portable and easy to operate. It gets very hot and has good air flow. I would highly recommend this to anyone who does their own hair at home or to travel around. Great product!</li>
            <li> I must say that the drying power is very good but the first time I used the dryer the hose disconnected and I had to hold it in place the whole time that I dried my hair... very uncomfortable and I did take it back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad at myself for not purchasing this dryer a long time ago.  First of all everything is in the purple case.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t take up nearly as much space as a the commonly used hair dryer.  Finally, this item does the job exceptionally well.  I have had dreads for five years now, which means they are long.  My normal hair dryer was not drying my dreads fully.  Laila Ali&#x27;s Bonnet Dryer allows me to fully cover my dreads, which means they turn out beautifully styled every time!!!!!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> barely takes up any space, extremely stylish, dries hair very quickly, the front of your hair doesnt get as much heat but once you move the hose closer to the front for just a few minutes thats all it takes</li>
            <li> Works great and the hot and cold buttons work well. But there&#x27;s no warm. The cord is a decent length, but I usually dry my hair in my bed so I can doze off :)</li>
            <li> Heater broke in my car so I rigged this up to an inverter to be able to defrost my windows for a winter drive so it&#x27;s a slightly different useage than it&#x27;s designed for.  That said, I only gave it three stars primarily because of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;Works, puts out a reasonable amount of heat, used it for 4 straight hours during a cold winter drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like it&#x27;s falling apart when it&#x27;s starting up.  Bit of a grinding noise.&lt;br /&gt;The entire unit is one-piece, from the attached lid which only swings up 90 degrees to the holes for the hose, bonnet and cable.  The unit I&#x27;d used previously consisted of just the fan unit with a bag holding the accessories.  I&#x27;d much prefer that since it&#x27;s less bulky and clutsy.  Seriously tempted to break off the lid and reattach with velcro and then find a way to sawzall the extraneous parts off and just keep the fan.  Probably not worth the trouble, other than just to have a project.&lt;br /&gt;I think the hose is glued to the fan rather than attached in a removable manner, like the bonnet.  Means it&#x27;ll crack sooner than later but for the price, is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  If you want an inexpensive and apparently reliable hair dryer, this works fine.  If you expect good, space efficient design and a quiet motor, look elsewhere.  Reasonable purchase, if clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it. Portable and works great</li>
            <li> This dryer is very portable and easy to put together. Ideal for wet sets. It blows up into a big balloon and fits my flexirods. Not functional for a deep conditioner sitting. It will blow up but slides even with the ties on the side. The hot setting can get really hot after awhile. Its a cute and functional little dryer. Its not too big and bulky.</li>
            <li> So far I used this on myself and 2 friends. Did a deep condition with the J Beverly Hills masque and dried our hair. It works amazing. Our hair feels soft and conditioned. Did a foam wrap and silk wrap on 2 clients. Yes, I&#x27;m a freelance hair stylist and use this dryer on location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers stated. It gets very hot and dries fast. I simply leave the ears out or put those $3 ear covers on. The back of the neck may get a little warm too. No big deal, just put a towel on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer may slide off on the highest setting, again, no big deal. Pull the drawstrings tight, Tie the strings around the front and and then tie it in the back. Sort of like if you were tying a satin scarf around your head. Use that technique and it won&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> All the controls work. I like the big bonnet for fitting all my hair but the heat almost blows the cap off so like another reviewer, I ended up tying the string under my chin. Great color and portability. But because of the fan you have to put it on a hard surface so that it won&#x27;t overheat. Overall it suits my purposes.</li>
            <li> First, I must say right off that I haven&#x27;t even opened the box yet so I can&#x27;t speak to how it works or doesn&#x27;t work. I can say, however, that what I received is not what&#x27;s pictured here. I&#x27;m not sure if the product has been updated but the model number is the same. What I received doesn&#x27;t have a case top that opens, it is just like the Revlon and Conair models with the hose coming from the side of the case. I&#x27;m not sure I like this and I purposely didn&#x27;t order those models for that reason, HOWEVER, the photo of the pictured model shows 2 heat settings, what I received has 3. I really liked the bonnet on the pictured dryer and the model I received has the typical bonnet. I\\&quot;m not sure yet if I&#x27;m keeping this or exchanging for another model yet, but I wanted what was pictured, not what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon has updated their photo of this product since I posted my previous review. I am yet to take it out of the box because I am torn about whether to keep it. Has anyone tried this particular model? What were your results?</li>
            <li> I love this! My hair has so much volume, no frizz, and it really cuts down on my drying time. Also it&#x27;s a plus that I can sit comfortably on my sofa. Note: I have long curly hair that falls to the middle of my back and I found that I get the best effect when I flip my hair over and lower my head into the cap. Low heat for 30 minutes. Remove cap, shake my hair out, open the cap completely and lay it over my head on low heat for another 15 minutes to dry the roots in the middle of my head under all my hair. It usually takes me 2-3 hours to air dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it.  Says it&#x27;s the best portable dryer she has ever had.</li>
            <li> She has been wanting a dryer for some time.  I saw the reviews of this one and surprised her with it.  She loves it - says it  has all the bells and whistles she was looking for!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best $$$$ I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  I was concerned that the heat may not be sufficient as I have very thick, curly, African-american hair that I wear natural most days.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  The one thing that I will mirror saying as did other reviewers - make certain you wrap either some cotton coil or a thin scarf around the nape of neck and ears when using the HIGH heat setting.  Similar to when you&#x27;re in a beauty salon so I wasn&#x27;t too put out about that and appreciated the forewarning.  It&#x27;s small, compact and fits nicely in my smallest, carry-on suitcase.  Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Dryer blows cold air! It never worked! Tried returning it but received so many hassles. I paid a great deal of money for a faulty product. Completely disappointed! Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I feel like it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> If they were any doubts this dryer does work. I use it every weekend when I wash my hair and roller set it.  The bonnet is large if you use big rollers. This dryer is very good. Good but, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Perfect for convenience for the spouse, great for travel if needed or those special occasions that make the ladies happy</li>
            <li> The bonnet is hard to get back in case.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because the bonnet could be a little tighter to hold in the heat.. I have been wearing natural hair for about a year and have found this product very handy to dry my hair quickly when needed.  I generally let my hair air dry, however, on days I need to dry my style I can sit under this bonnet for about 30-45 mins.  I would recommend if you need something convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li> It worked well for me. Dried my hair in a reasonable amount of time. No problem with it being too hot around the ears.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde naturally curly hair and I spend a lot of time straightening it because I think it looks more polished and professional when I do.  However, I wanted to find a way to do it without the flat iron all the time.  I bought some large velcro rollers and the Laila Ali bonnet dryer.  I had no idea what I was doing, but watched about 2 hours of You Tube videos to learn how to roll it.  Now I love the results and this little dryer is a powerhouse!  It runs very quietly, but heats quite well.  In fact, I&#x27;m under it now as I write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for heated treatments and for drying it with my rollers in.  My hair comes down to just below the middle of my back and I have a lot of it.  When I roll it with jumbo rollers it takes about 30 rollers.  Even with all those large rollers in, it is easy for me to get the bonnet over the rollers as it is quite large.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the vendor shipped it faster than I expected and it came well packaged.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This dryer does the job but I wish the cord was longer.  The price was good.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the only portable bonnet dryer out there that will fit over my larger-than-average (I&#x27;m a 6-footer) head, covered in large curlers. Other folks said they needed a towel to protect their necks from the heat. I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem. I love that it will dry my hair without the same level of damage you&#x27;d get from a drying tool such as a flat or curling iron, or one of those drying/styling brushes. (all of which I have) The only drawback is that if you have relatively long hair, it can take 1 1/2- 2 hours to completely dry. And if your hair is curly, you KNOW what pulling the curlers out of not-quite-dry hair can do: Frizz like crazy! So yes; I&#x27;d recommend, but be aware of those slight drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I have a bonnet dryer from the 60&#x27;s; it makes my hair so soft, but it smells like old plastic. The Laila dryer does dry my hair but does not give it the softness.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is not very attractive but it does the job. I have very curly hair and like to partially dry it in a bonnet. It helps to bring out my curl.</li>
            <li> This little thing packs more of a drying lunch than I thought it would! I&#x27;m impressed. I needed something since my hooded dryer just completely died on me. This is great &amp; not damaging on my natural curls!</li>
            <li> If you are serious about doing your own hair at home or if you do hair on the side this isa great dryer to have the bonnet is huge you can be stress free if you have long thick hair and user large rollers they will fit! It is a cute dryer too not to mention that it works great without burning your neck or ears. Seems like this will last mea long time and I plan on using this 6 or more times a month will post soon on my youtube page</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly long dreadlocks, and getting them dry after washing is a challenge. Regular hand held dryer took too long and didn&#x27;t really get them dry.&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly. Yes, it does take about 2 hours to dry my hair. That&#x27;s no different when I go to the salon to have them done up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One funny note, according to the directions you cannot put this dryer on any surface. Since I don&#x27;t have the ability to levitate inanimate objects, I put it on a rectangular waste bin shortwise like the letter H. Air flow is then not impeded.</li>
            <li> Love this! my hair was dry in half the time it usually takes! I am impressed with that because i have thick hair</li>
            <li> I like this dryer a lot. It is very portable and gets nice and hot. I have used it for my roller sets and my hair always turns out great. The bonnet is very large and fits over my rollers with no problem. I also like that I can use it anywhere. I sit and do things on my I-pad and have even laid down and relaxed while letting my hair dry. I have a hard bonnet dryer too but I like that this one is easier to take with me when traveling or when needed to move from room to room.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time last weekend. All I can say is that if you are a natural you need this. I love this machine!  It is nice &amp; compact and I do expect it to travel with me.</li>
            <li> It was awful. It stopped working on the 1st day. Literally wasted my money. And it discourages to do online shopping.</li>
            <li> I had a vintage bonnet hair dryer that finally bit the dust and Iwas searching for a replacement when I found this! It&#x27;s great! It has a large bonnet that covers all of my nearly waist-length hair. It&#x27;s comfortable and it has adjustable heat settings so that it always feels just right. It does the job that I wan&#x27;t it to do.</li>
            <li> I like it for its small convenient size, but I wish it had a little more heating power It just needs to be a little hotter.</li>
            <li> Hey, it works  Yes the hose can come undone from the hood pretty easy if your&#x27;e moving around.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little stiff to get all the stuff back in the case, but overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quite well.  The cool is really just lukewarm, which I like cause a lot of heat gives me a headache.  Good price!  Buy it</li>
            <li> I got this to do a hot oil treatment for my hair. I was glad that this did not make a ton of noise as the old hair dryer I had scared my one cat. It works easy and wish that the bonnet was smaller. I had a problem with this falling down over my eyes. I like that this can be stored in the container it came in. The heat is perfect for me and felt good on a cold winters day. If you are looking for one of these then this one should be considered.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  It fits comfortably on your head and it is very pretty.  I also love how you can transport it around.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> It used to take me 1 hour to dry my hair...Using this model one only needs a half hour because its ionic.  I simply wished the bonnet was bigger to handle larger rollers with out bumping them loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be awesome if this product were available in the UK voltage format.</li>
            <li> Finally a good dryer! We love it! Great product. We would buy it again and again. We have been very pleased with how well it works!</li>
            <li> Love it the best bonnet on the market shipped fast too, and the color purple and black rocks with all my accessories so I am virtually  styling while I am getting my beauty and glamor on. Love Laiala Ali product. Every woman should have one. Order yours today and let your hair grow by using this product to do montly deep hair conditioning, great for roller setting Laila Ali&#x27;s Bonnet is  surpreme for all hair types dread,braids, naturally free, and other racs of hair. AAAA++++</li>
            <li> It is ok. I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t really used it yet. I like the way it is stored in the case.</li>
            <li> The dryer I originally wanted to purchase (portable salon dryer) was out of stock , and I felt like the other dryers would be a waste of money because of the negative reviews. So I went out on a limb and decided to give this dryer a chance. I had never used a soft bonnet dryer before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. To my surprise, it worked great. The only problem I had, and eventually solved, was getting the bonnet tight enough and keeping it in place.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. Dryer has 2 settings Hot or cool it really get HOT, real hot :-) wished it had a medium setting. I have to get use to the Bonnet, tying the bonnet on :-) I know that will come w/usage but overall I like dryer. It&#x27;s convenient easy to store doesn&#x27;t take up much space fits nicely in my closet. Excellent price...cool color.</li>
            <li> This is the best bonnet hair dryer I have ever used.  Hot is Hot, and the Cool is nice and Cool.  I love this dryer.  Wish I had owned it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my product and the job that it does</li>
            <li> It was great, my mother likes it very well. It does the trick.</li>
            <li> The best bonnet hairdryer I have owned.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works very well for drying my dreads after retwisting!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Heats up quickly.  Fits really well...without hurting.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift to my daughter and she is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to make the bonnet stay in place when hooking it to the tube nozzle sometimes but this product still manages to deliver.  I use it to do my deep conditioning treatments at home. It is definitely worth the money I have saved by not having to frequent a salon :).</li>
            <li> This bonnet cap sells for $40 at walmart and around the same everywhere else. This company has raised the price far too high.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to use, powerful enough, affordable. Bonnet is big enough to fit any style. A total winner!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend that has long dreads and she is in love with it.  She can finally dry her dreads beautifully under bonnet and can watch a movie at the same time :).  She will now be able to go into pool this year because she can now dry her hair in hours compared to days of letting them dry on their own.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on high customer reviews, but was not satisfied. The hose is permanently attached to the unit so you have to put the bonnet on and then snap the hose on (not easy). The drying time is longer than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Was way better quality then I expected,I have extremely long hair it all fits easily the bonnet is a bit clumsy yet fit well.Hair dried fast and felt full of extra body.worth the buy:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer!!  The bonnet fits over extra large rollers and the entire dryer is so compact and easy to store!&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this dryer really knew what they were doing!!</li>
            <li> I started looking for a bonnet dryer after my hooded dryer quit on me.  I am a natural girl, and I hate how long it takes for my twists to dry.  The first time I used it, my hair was completely dry (when air drying takes 2 full days) in 30 minutes!!! I tend to use the Medium setting.  This dryer comes with 4 settings though, Cool, Low, Medium and High.  This dryer is great for me, but it also does a great job of keeping heat out of my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s face when I use it on her. The elastic around the bonnet is adjustable, so it will fit everyone from a child, to an adult with a head full of rollers. My favorite part is the dryer has a compartment for the hose, the bonnet and the cord - without being a flip-top design.  This makes storing and using this dryer a breeze!  If you are at all on the fence (like I was), try it!!! You&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
            <li> Rated it with a three because altough it fits my rollers I expected the bonnet to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Laila&#x27;s hair is longer than mine so I expected it to be a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the heating levels, excelent and as stated in other reviews heat is well kept inside.</li>
            <li> No idea how this can be so highly rated.  Not certain if I received a defective dryer, or if power is really this bad.  Doesn&#x27;t blow with enough force to inflate the bonnet.  Used for the first time, tonight (Saturday)--returning on Monday. Laila Ali should not have her name associated with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with really corse hair. This bonnet dryer has been the best thing for my hair as it dries super fast and making my hair soft afterwards. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Used it once since it arrived; just to try it out.  It is very comfortable and drys really well.  As far as durability for the long haul... we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, product is better than stated. I would recommend to anyone. If your hair is long and thick like mine. You will love this dryer. I run my temp on high and place cotton around my ears and neck.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. My hair is thick (and my head&#x27;s kind of big lol) so it fits perfect on my head. Gets hot really fast so have a thick towel around your neck just in case. Great for deep conditioning and dries my hair really fast. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for children though, might want to get Conair or a brand with a smaller bonnet</li>
            <li> It worked perfect for me...I was careful to be aware that it may get too hot and possibly shut off (some reviews about products similar to this one had that problem) but I haven&#x27;t had to worry about that.  It heats up pretty good. I love that it is compact, all the pieces fit in their place and it gets the job done.  I would def recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here on amazon, I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad that I did. This is a great bonnet dryer. I love the settings. It gets hot enough and its not that loud. I&#x27;ve only used it once; so far its working PERFECTLY. I recently have gone natural and needed an inexpensive hair dryer for my twist outs as well as hot oil treatments. So Laila Ali thumbs up to you and your team for designing a great product.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to do my hot oil treatments. It worked great for the money...you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I had a problem with is getting the bonnet to stay on my head. And I think that&#x27;s just a trial and error&lt;br /&gt;thing, it should be fine once I use it a few more times and get it tied right.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and they love it. I would probably purchase items from this product line again.</li>
            <li> It was great at first, and then for some reason the airflow slowed down, and the bonnet wouldn&#x27;t fill up like it was supposed to. I was very upset and bummed, because when it worked it was great.</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact in size and high on heat. It produces a great amount of noise so you are best to get your kindle to read versus watching a TV program while it is on.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets to hot on the hot cycle. The low cycle is not hot enough. The air seems to be concentrated in the top of your head</li>
            <li> I am excited to use the dryer. I love how the equipment is all together and easy to carry from one place to another. It was purchased so that my daughter could use it in college.  We have not used it yet but the ratings and review seem very favorable.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my dryer it takes less time to dry my hair no more two hours. And most of all I can take it with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.I only gave it 4 stars because it gets very hot even on the lower setting</li>
            <li> I returned the product because of the cost..over priced.  I should have researched first prior to purchasing. This dryer can be purchased at Walmart for $38.00 as opposed to $96.00.</li>
            <li> This item has changed. The one I received does not look like this, and to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the new one. I don&#x27;t like the new look, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the version I received. Mine was purple and black, my favorite colors, and the case was rounded with the built in handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular hard bonnet dryers gave me a headache and made my neck stiff. It was a PITA to set the dryer up on the table and then find enough phone books or pillows on the chair. I&#x27;m not a short person, either. Setting this dryer up is a snap: set the unit on the table, open the case, pull out the bonnet, connect it to the hose. On goes the bonnet, I hit the cool setting and that&#x27;s it. I can sit at my computer or watch tv. I&#x27;m done in an hour. This dryer leaves my hair feeling soft and slightly damp. I never use a dryer to dry my hair all the way; I use just enough heat to take the damp off and I allow my hair to air dry. The bonnet is very large, and black, with thin straps that can be used to secure it if need be. I have waist length locked hair and I still have plenty of room. The sound of the motor is loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely five stars. It&#x27;s too bad they changed the design.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer a lot. I don&#x27;t understand the heat settings though. The hot is TOO hot. It does the job though.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy. It is fairly quiet and the temperature settings make it great to use on kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  The bonnet keeps the heat inside the bonnet, is large enough for jumbo rollers and gets much hotter than my old Gold-n-Hot dryer.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> wished it will streatch a little more to be more flexiable but over all pretty cool</li>
            <li> compact, chic and sleek the color rocks and so does the dryer itself. very portable and heats up very well.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this dryer from my local Wal-mart, but it appears to be the same unit.  I am using as I write this review.  This is however, my first use.  I admit that I was very concerned when I first looked at the bonnet and thought no way this would work.  So far,it seems to be doing just fine.  The settings seem to be true to their description.  If you are expecting the cool setting to be &#x27;freeze dried&#x27; then I&#x27;m not sure what you would actually purchase.  But for me,after using the hot setting for 45 min, the cool setting is nice.  I checked three of my rollers after the hot cycle and my hair was 97% dry.  Which is very comparable to my last visit to my local salon.  The drawback I encountered was that I feel the need to rotate the cap/hose position as the side without the hose didn&#x27;t seem to get quite as much air.  But at least I con get a roller set at home at 10pm when I can&#x27;t get to any hair salon!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry fast. But it does get very out around the ear area. Gave 4 stars for Laila only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now and have used it over 15 times.  It works great.  I tie a hair scarf around the outer edge of bonnet to keep air from escaping and that works great for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; dries quickly; very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this hair dryer at the beginning of the year (almost 6 months ago). I was looking for a hood dryer that was powerful and easy to store. I&#x27;ve only used it about 6 times and it&#x27;s broken already. The ring that the hose attaches to has detached from the hood. Which basically means that it&#x27;s blowing hot air out, but not into the hood. I am very disappointed! When it was working, it worked well. But, now it&#x27;s useless and I have to invest in something new. Although they take up more room, I&#x27;ll probably go with a hard shell next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer I&#x27;ve had. I bought it because of Laila Ali and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Dries hair quickly, isn&#x27;t too loud and the bonnet is large enough to fit over large hair rollers. I would recomnmend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good if you want to do something else (like write reviews on Amazon) while you dry your hair.  Oodles of heat and the bonnet fits well.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the fan were quieter.</li>
            <li> I received the item pictured (white hose, white bonnet) and was disappointed.  I purchased to cut down on drying my natural hair and time spent holding a blow dryer.  The item is not good for drying 3c curls.  It gets really hot on the neck and I only had it on medium and those hose was hot and not log enough.  Did not dry the front of my hair like it did the back.  It is very loud and made of cheap plastic; I though the hose was going to break off when I was trying to pull it out.  I figured my hair would get smashed, but this not only smashed my curls, it straightened one piece out and left frizz.  I know when I wet it, it will curl back up, but the bonnet shouldn&#x27;t do that.  I&#x27;ve seen video reviews of the previous version with the black hose and hood and think that would have worked better with my hair as it does not sit as tight as this one does.  It&#x27;s like a big shower cap.  I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> This dryer is only useable at the lowest setting every other setting is simply too hot. It feels cheap and a burnt plastic smell is always present every time it&#x27;s in use. The only thing that makes this product worth it is the price.</li>
            <li> I like the compactness of this product, and the portability. However, I use large rollers in my hair, and the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t easily fit over them. It does disturb the rollers, and is right once all the way on. It seems like the hair takes longer to dry because of this.  I also wish the tub to the dryer was a little longer, and didn&#x27;t slide out of the bonnet so easily.</li>
            <li> Shipped received fast. Dryer as described. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it really made my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love the setting and especially the colors: purple and black</li>
            <li> Got tired of leaving the house with wet, white (from styling creams) hair so I opted for this bonnet dryer to speed drying time.  The bonnet ties at the back of your neck and has 3-4 holes at the front and sides of the bonnet that I suspect are supposed to keep it cool on your head. The problem is that after 20-25 minutes under the dryer the middle of your head is dry but the front and sides where the cooling holes are still extremely wet. I still have to blast my front with a blow dryer. Not my idea of efficiency.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dyer the controls are very easy to use and the hot hair really gets out. I used this dryer on my roller set and they dried within less than an hr the only thing I hate is that the air tunnel isn&#x27;t really long other than that this is the Best!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen who used this type of hair dryer when I was a teen.  I can take a nap while my hair drys.  Curling irons burn my hair and head.</li>
            <li> I needed a soft bonnet dryer, and  so far so good. I really wish the bonnet was litttle bigger.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality bonnet dryer to do my deep conditioning treatments with and had researched alot of other dryers that had several complaints until I finally came across this dryer! I love this dryer! it&#x27;s light weight, has a long cord which allows for movement while your doing your treatments, and my favorite thing about it is that it came in a cute purple case that is easy to store. The cap is good quality and very strong but the cap does run big-not worry though, it does have a drawstring so that it can be adjusted to fit your head. Only complaint is that it does feel like its going to fly off your head at times but I usually just double tie around the whole head and then its fine. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It heats up well and works effeciently i just wish it had a longer tube to work with and a firm stand</li>
            <li> Dries hair very nicely.  Hard to get the bonnet back in its compartment after use, then it&#x27;s very hard to get it back out to use again.  Can&#x27;t get the hose back in its slot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of transitioning natural and this dryer is a life saver when my bantu knots are still wet or damp and with my deep conditioning. It&#x27;s not only pretty because it is purple and small but it&#x27;s also equivalent to a hooded dryer. Same amount of power. However while my hair is drying with the bonnet I can do my make up, pick out my clothes,  get dressed,  and even take a nap (lol). Best buy in a while.</li>
            <li> I like it. Yes you&#x27;ll feel a little heat on your neck at high setting but, you feel that wit hooded dryers. A towel around my neck solves the problem.  I think it works well. It cools off quickly after use. I wish the hose was a little longer but these types of dryers don&#x27;t have long hoses. I like the size and design of the cap. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I put this dryer through it&#x27;s paces and found it to be more than efficient. I would have given it a five but it said there were three settings when there were only two. Other than that it dried my head full of curly hair quickly after my first Curlformers attempt and I loved the results. After almost fifteen years with natural hair I&#x27;m finally exploring styles other than a \\&quot;press\\&quot; or curly fro or ponytail. It also seems great for deep conditioning that will be my next test ...you can read more about how that goes at NaturalSistahs dot com</li>
            <li> Best dryer every nice light compact the bonnet has allot of pressure feels like it will blow off but i put it over my ears and it doesnt move at all.  And my ears dont get hot at all</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast...love the product!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  NO complaints.</li>
            <li> This dryer is affordable and so far I have only been using it to steam my hair or for conditioning treatments. My hair was dry and had no body before and after, I am just bouncing, moisturized and healthy looking and soft to the touch. My fingers can do a run through test without any pause. Love this little dryer. Excellent for traveling too.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. My hair is dry in no time even on the low setting. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great bonnets It&#x27;s convenient yet powerful. You can dry your hair while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;The only two negatives are 1. The machine can be a little loud depending how you set it down.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cap is not that strong :(&lt;br /&gt; I can tell it&#x27;s not going to last long. I have a better cap from my other bonnet dryer which I&#x27;m going to save.&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to have a  bonnet dryer already and your in need of replacing it make sure you keep the plastic cap. They are standard and can be used on all or most bonnet dryer machine.</li>
            <li> Works great for deep conditioning. Hose could me a but more insulated so it doesn&#x27;t feel hot to touch, but otherwise than that, I love it. Def not a waste of money. Bonett fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Pretty good dryer. I&#x27;m happy with it so far. Dried quickly. Only setback is the hoes can come out a bit too easy but I managed to work it out</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast. Wish the hose was longer. Gets very hot!!!</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for 6 months using it only 2 times before the hose plastic connection to the bonnet lost its ability to remain attached. The 3rd time I used the dryer I managed to keep the hose attached to the bonnet by wrapping a piece of cloth around the connection point, only to discover after 15 minutes of drying that the hose became disconnected from the plastic piece that connects to the bonnet rendering the dryer completely useless.</li>
            <li> Works well. Beautiful color. Well built. Gave it only 3 points because&lt;br /&gt; the air hose is very very short. Very short. Would like it better with 8 or 10 inches added to hose. You literally have to hold it in your lap or sit at your makeup stand from beginning to end.  And then the cap will have to be turned backwards so the air hose is on the front of your head. The hose is not long enough to have the cap on correctly. But if you are willing to hold it it will work well for you. Good product. Bad hose length.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer... it works very well.  I knocked a star off for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- the hose could be a bit longer, making it easier to place it behind you and move around a bit&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it to stay on your head unless you rig the shoelace tightening string just right&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t dry super evenly... the hair on the sides and in the front doesn&#x27;t get very good air flow so it takes longer to dry those parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it frequently and love to set my curlers with it (it&#x27;s big enough for lots of large rollers), so it still gets 4 stars.  :)</li>
            <li> This dryer is hotter than my old bonnet dryer, even on the medium setting, so the drying time is faster. I recommend the ear covers, and also put a towel around the neck to protect those areas from the heat. The reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars is that the product is not solidly made although on first few uses it works well. The power off button did not work at first and I had to unplug it turn the dryer off. I am being very careful with the case, handle and bonnet connection and hope it stands up to long term usage.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the hose conector is cheap.</li>
            <li> This product is Okay! The bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay on properly unless you sit in a somewhat uncomfortable spot. The button too turn it too off doesn&#x27;t always position in the right spot when turning, as I had to unplug it several times to turn off. Im not sure it its a defect in manufacturers product or cheaply made. Im guessing the later. I promise if it wasn&#x27;t a pain in the A$$ to send back, I&#x27;d ask for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I love this product. No complaints</li>
            <li> Works well. The cap may be a bit small for large curlers.  Sometimes I have to hold the airhose to allow air flow through the whole cap.</li>
            <li> Very convenient bc I can quickly use it while I&#x27;m still getting ready for work. I&#x27;m using it right now actually. I got her hand held dryer and I didn&#x27;t like it because it kept cutting off whenever it got too hot, so I was a bit weary getting this. Thankfully it works out great for me. Definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the strap isn&#x27;t very efficient because the hot air comes out and burns your neck and ear</li>
            <li> I bought this hair drier based upon the reviews, and I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I have waited to write a review. Wanted to use the item first. Purchased this a month ago and have been using it since. I love it! I like how you have a warm and a hot, but hot doesn&#x27;t burn you. It&#x27;s just hot..easy to use, not like a solid hood dryer where u have to sit under it and figure out how u can do that and still be comfortable. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works great but the hose connector broke off. I had to duct tape it together.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product. Unfortunately, I did not open it in time to find out before the deadline to return this product. So now I am stuck with it. The bonnet is cheap. the adjustable soft hose comes out of the bonnet very easily and is too short. Don&#x27;t even think about moving your head one centimeter with short length. I would not recommend purchasing this product. Spend the extra money and get something more durable and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair dryer that is portable as well as hot enough to dry hair quickly. This dryer definitely fits the bill. The dryer is extremely lightweight but also has enough heat capacity so that I do not have sit under the dryer all day! Love this purchase! Quality product.</li>
            <li> I love it. It does exactly what I need it to do and distributes heat evenly during my deep conditioning treatments. I took the advice of other reviewers and tied the strap under my chin and it stays on perfectly.</li>
            <li> The hose would not stay connected to drying unit no matter how many times I tried to reconnect it.  The bonnet is not large enough for jumbo rollers and it doe not allow for any movement at all, I had to keep my head tilted toward the unit the entire time.  I returned this item and will try again with a different product.</li>
            <li> Love everything bout it. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to roll and style my hair again.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for an economical bonnet dryer that I could use with conditioners to help improve my dry hair. This has been a great option.  Two air levels, good coverage, comfortable -- and it stores away very compactly.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Soft Bonnet Dryer.  I am sure I will enjoy it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just got my soft bonnet dryer today. Its Tuesday. I ordered it Sunday. That was Fast!&lt;br /&gt;I am using it right now after washing and wrapping my hair. Its comfortable. Easy to use. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is easy to store and use in any room or space.</li>
            <li> Great compact hair dryer. Gives off excellent heat and adjusts easily. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer!! I have had hooded dryers in the past and hated then!! They are bulky and loud and you feel confined to one spot the whole time you are under them.  This dryer allows mobility and is lightweight.  Its not too loud and it dries sooo fast!! My hair is past shoulder length and when doing roller sets, it is capable of drying fully in an hour, which used to take me an hour and a half.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this dryer. Love the hot and cold settings as well as high and low also.  Would def purchase again. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A nice dryer, works well. Bonnet is made of nice material and so far everything is holding up and working just fine.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. It looks as pictured and works well. The only thing is the hood slips on your head. Other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li> Cute, light-weight, convenient, affordable, portable, comfortable and great product. The settings are fine, (2- hot/cool, high/low). The noise is level is not too loud from my experience and I have fallen asleep a couple of times during my hot oil treatments. The hair bonnet has a draw string that allows you to adjust it onto your head. The bonnet may slide down but only if you have a very small head like a child. I recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> Its very light weight and I like the fact that it is portable. I found that my ears start to burn if I have it on high for more than 5 minutes and the hose is really sensitive. After two or three head movements, the hose comes out of the bonnet and I have to adjust it. I realize that you are supposed to be &amp;#34;still&amp;#34; under the dryer but I don&#x27;t think that you should have to be a statue in order to keep the hose in place. Overall, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bonnet dryer.  The first two were cheap garbage.  One attached to my blow dryer and regularly popped off when it was not burning my scalp as it routinely overheated.  This one has a hose that is of sturdy construction.  The bonnet itself fits perfect with the draw strings. Best part for me was that the air is circulating eveywhere in the bonnet, not just at the connection of the hose to the bonnet.  I saw previous  comments about the bonnet and would like to explain that this type of dryer is for someone who needs to wear curlers to really get a good style.  I have fine hair and can&#x27;t simply style with a blowdryer and get the volume.  If you are just wanting to just dry your hair, your best bet is a blow dryer as the bonnet was designed for use with curlers.  I guarantee if you try it with curlers, it will not move around when turned on and will dry your hair while you read a book, email, etc.  Also, it was here in a few days, not 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> who is in nursing home and can&#x27;t take getting blown dry due to the heat on her head (stroke victim)&lt;br /&gt;So they roll her up and use this which has lower heat.</li>
            <li> Used it once and it got the job done. It gets hot and it&#x27;s very convenient. I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hose from dryer to bonnet too short, bonnet too tight.</li>
            <li> Heat gets very Hot and begins to burn neck and ears- High heat setting not recommended. Also, extension cord not very long- limited travel distance while using product.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; hair dryer, but this one is great. I like to roll my hair on the velcro curlers and then dry it with this hair dryer. I get the longest lasting curls with this method. It&#x27;s light and small enough that I will be able to take it when I have to travel for work. Seems to be well constructed and I expect to get many years use out of it. The price was very reasonable, too, compared to products I had seen in area beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job. Runs quietly. The settings are interchangeable. The color is great. Great product. Priced comparable to other bonnet dryers.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is comfortable.  However The hose doesn&#x27;t fit back in like it used to, and sometimes it will not click to off and I have to unplug it.  I hope they improve the design because I would buy it again.   It gets overly hot now and the plastic part that attaches to the bonnet cracked and I tie a scarf around it to cover the hole and hold the heat.  On the other end I have a paper towel to hold the hose into the machine. It lasted about 3 years, time to replace it</li>
            <li> So much easier to deep condition (DC) my hair while sitting in bed or on the sofa!  Since it&#x27;s comfortable and effective,  I DC more often.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> I needed a bonnet dryer for my 88 year old mother. These are hard to find and this one does the  job just great.</li>
            <li> Does it job well, I have thick hair and it takes me about 40 minutes to try i on curlers. The only thing: it can burn your neck, so I suggest you put a towel there.</li>
            <li> Tried it. Loved it. Heats up like a little champ. Will totally pack in a carry on next trip away. A+.</li>
            <li> Previous store purchased dryer came apart where the hose couples into the hood the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;In reading reviews for this product I was concerned about the same problem.  So far tthis product has worked perfectly and the o ring is still firmly attatched to the hood.  I solved the problem of the hood  blowing off  due to the strong air flow by tying the strings under my chin like a bonnet.  Turning the dryer on before putting it on softens the hood plastic some and makes it easier to put on.  Yes, I would purchase this dryer again.</li>
            <li> I have long rather thick hair that is naturally curly. I had been partitioning my hair and rolling up the locks, securing them with clips and air drying my hair. It took too long and my only other option was to use a blow dryer which was not as effective. This bonnet dryer has several heat settings and dried my hair more quickly and evenly. The hose stays securely attached to the bonnet if you turn it to a its locking position. the hose, bonnet and cord are self storing,which I like. The motor is not overly loud, but I did have to turn the units air intake away from me to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li> Love the light weight of this dryer. It gets the job done. Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have no problem with this bonnet... setup is super easy, only within a minute. I like that it has three different setting; from cool, warm, and hot. It is just perfect for my deep conditioning treatments. The cap is ajustable with a draw string, which is great! The heat is really hot and the best part is that, the heat flows through the entire areas of head. I really like it and will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I&#x27;ve received it but I am happy with it.  You do have to hold the hose or it will fault out.</li>
            <li> I used to take almost an hour drying my hair in rollers. This does it in 15 minutes. Plus I can put on make up while my hair is drying. I like it so much, I am ordering another one for our second home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft bonnet for a while, so glad that I found it! I love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the dryer itself.  However, the shape if the hood is like a cone .  Once you turn on the heat the air shuts to the top and blows the hood off.  Definitely need to reconstruct the shape of the hood</li>
            <li> I am in the process of returning this item. It appeared used, sign of wear on it.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase.  The bonet has a large size to fit my big rollers.  It dries hair fast.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved how this worked. It was very easy to do and I just sat in my bed and watched a movie while I dried my hair! I love this little device! I use it when I do a deep conditioner! I don&#x27;t have to use my hands and it did a wonderful job at drying my hair without frizzing!! Thanks for a great product!! This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would.  You get what you pay for with this product.  The price is cheap and so is the product.  After reading all the great reviews, I was extremely excited when it arrived in the mail and I could not wait to use it.  After the first use, I was extremely disappointed.  What a let down!  The product did not heat or dry evenly.  My daughter complained that it was extremely hot in the back where the nozzle enters the bonnet and the front and sides were not as hot.  Also, my daughter was under the dryer for an hour and her hair was still damp.  I didn&#x27;t waste my time trying it again.  I immediately shipped it back the following week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the weekend, I went to Sally&#x27;s and purchased their Modern Elements 1875W Ionic Pro Rollabout Tourmaline Dryer.  As of 09-Jul-2014, its on sale for $99.  I had a $5 coupon so the cost to me was $95 plus tax.  It was more than I wanted to spend but so far is works like a champ and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It works great. Me and my hair are happy.:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate it  Sitting here trying to get the hose out of the case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one ever the only reason I give it a 4 star is because the tube constantly falls of the cap other then that it leaves your hair beautiful</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> I chose this product, for the convenience first; I liked the idea of being able to unplug the bonnet to take breaks from drying, or if I needed to do something else.  It&#x27;s compact, and the shocking purple is so pretty and attractive.  There are technically 4 settings, which is enough for what I need it for:  Deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, quick sets (twists &amp; braids).</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been nice but the bonnet just want big enough.</li>
            <li> I love the color purple and the cute case. However, when i turn it on, the bonnet does not stay entirely on my head. As the air blows in, i begin to look like a cone head and it raises up over my ear. My previous bonnet dryer never moved out of place. I did not have rollers in my hair, was just drying to dry my hair. Secondly the tube is hot and was sitting against my neck, if you wear a scarf you will be fine, lol.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but it took to long to dry my hair, I had to finish drying it with a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It dries my hair quickly and is so compact it&#x27;s easy to store away. The bonnet has adjustable strings so you can fit the big rollers under it. I have a big head (lol), and with the rollers I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit, but it did. And I had extra room.</li>
            <li> Love love love!! Definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer I have used it on my 8 yrs old hair for her deep conditioning treatment for her natural hair and I use it on my relaxed hair and I am jooked.. it really does dry fast!</li>
            <li> this thing REALLY works. I love it. I sent pictures to my daughter. now they have one.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s portable. If I add an extension cord I could sit it on my counter while my breakfast. I used to have the standalone dryer where I had sit in one place - and that just felt inconvenient. It&#x27;s nice to get small tasks done *while* I am drying my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is the thickness of a Webster&#x27;s dictionary and I takes up very little space in the closet shelf.&lt;br /&gt;3) All of the accessories fit inside the purple case. So the cap and cord and hose have little compartments that they fit in.&lt;br /&gt;4) It get hot - it that&#x27;s what you need.&lt;br /&gt;5) Seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have long hair so it&#x27;s easier to put the cap on *and then* attach the hose. But it is also a little hard to do. I think I&#x27;m getting the knack of it now, but it took some practice.&lt;br /&gt;2) The hose gets hot so keep a towel handy to cover your arms or neck.&lt;br /&gt;3) There are no instructions on how to get the hose, cap and cord out of the purple case. I thought it opened like a suitcase, but no. It took me 5 mins to figure out that you twist and turn so the hose comes out of the hose compartment and the little black door on the side opens and that is where you will find the cord and cap. A little note would have helped, I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;4) This might work better for shorter hair, but I still think it&#x27;s a great product. I have hair just below my shoulders and I am still figuring out the best way to dry my hair right above the nape of my neck. Put my hair up in banana clip? What? It still dries 90% of my hair with no issue. it&#x27;s just that back bit that I am still trying to figure out. Maybe I&#x27;ll post an update when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The hose comes out the cap easily so it inhibits mobility, ie, if you move your head just a bit it comes out. It&#x27;s weird that they didn&#x27;t make it snap into place. Seems like a design flaw that could have been easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I had a similar dryer that my Mom had bought for me back in the late 1980&#x27;s manufactured by CONAIR but it finally wore out.  I had difficulty finding a similar dryer that was easy to use and portable, which is an added plus. So I looked on line and found the Laila Ali Bonnet Dryer. I&#x27;m glad I was persistent because it wasn&#x27;t that easy to find and there was so many other choices. Anyway, once I found this hair dryer and read the excellent reviews, I thought I would go ahead and take a chance. Well let me tell you ladies, this is a great product. The bonnet is easy to attach to the dryer hose and the elastic in the bonnet is adjustable to suit your comfort level.  Also the elastic in the bonnet is already adjusted tight enough (right out of the box) so that it has a snug comfortable fit. The dryer also has 4 settings: cool, low, medium and high.  I use my dryer to condition my hair, so for me the most comfortable setting is (low). The temperature is just right for conditioning.  However, for setting your hair which requires a little more heat, well this dryer will give you what you want. The bonnet is also large enough to accommodate large setting rollers for you ladies who have longer hair. You can use it anywhere in the house or travel with it.  I was also happy with the size, shape and color of the case. I love it because it&#x27;s so girlie. It reminds me of how women deserve to pamper themselves. I typed this review on my laptop while sitting under my dryer. Very comfortable!  I would definitely recommend this dryer! I would buy one again if I had to.  AAA+++  Sincerely,  Alicia</li>
            <li> Ive only used this twice. It gets way too hot  on the back of your head where the air comes in and doesn&#x27;t give an even dry when you&#x27;re finished. Plus it takes 2 hours just to get my hair somewhat dry. Will not be buying another one.</li>
            <li> This dryer is absolutely terrific! This dryer is compact and drys hair FAST. It&#x27;s my new hair go to. It&#x27;s so compact you can put it in a carry on bag!</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars; however where the hose attaches to the bonnet, if you move too much it will disconnect.  Other than that it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly every time!</li>
            <li> carrying case gets a little hot.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would get an additional star if it had a medium setting, low is too low, and hi is really hot! Also after a while the cord keeps detaching from the cap has to be reconnected several times while I&#x27;m drying my hair. Still this dryer is better than the others in it&#x27;s price range, I&#x27;ve bought several.</li>
            <li> I love it!  My daughter wanted to take it back to her apartment with her.</li>
            <li> Kept me from having to use my bulky hard dryer, Did the job I wanted.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS DRYER!!!!! It&#x27;s purple it convenient and it drys your hair fast. The only problem I had with this dryer is it burned a little on my neck I put a towel under and I was just fine.</li>
            <li> I used it on me and my daugter and it definelty gets hot enough to dry our natural roller styles.  I also use it to deep condition our hair, I love that it&#x27;s travel friendly and compact!!!  GReat purchase indeed!  :)</li>
            <li> A great replacement to the big hooded dryer.  Comfortable and convenient.  Heats up nicely leaving me with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt; Just what I needed some I could do other things while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer for deep conditioning  Love it</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!  I used this product once.  The first time it worked well.  I did have issues with the hose constantly becoming un-attached from the bonnet but otherwise it worked fine.  Next time I spent 45 minutes prepping my hair with velcro rollers, put on the cap and nothing....Would not turn on!  I specifically bought this product because it was endorsed by Laila Ali... Very dissappointing!</li>
            <li> my wife and daughter like it .</li>
            <li> works great easy storing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer.  The cap fits snug and it snaps onto the tube so that it will feel and look secure.  It gets really hot just like a regular sized dryer so don&#x27;t think that just because it&#x27;s little and compact that it will not put out the work that you rely and trust in.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and moderately curly hair.  After extensive research, I chose this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used blow-dryer to style my hair, it would take 45 minutes to an hour and I was never happy with the results. Now I just wash, towel dry, add product, and sit back with a cup of coffee and a book. I&#x27;m done in less than 15 minutes and my hair consistently looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is extremely lightweight, so I have to put it in my lap while I adjust the bonnet, and I can&#x27;t move around or it will fall, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for completely dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYW, the hose snaps into the bonnet if I twist in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help with deep conditioning my hair - My thought was it would pay for itself after a couple of DIY  treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it !!  Everything stores in side the case - it is compact - it cranks out the heat to where I had to move it to medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long gone are the days of pin curls and curlers but this is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS DRYER!!!! I DID READ THE REVIEWS, &amp; EVEN THOUGH SOME WERE BAD, I DECIDED TO TRY THE DRYER ANYWAY. IT DRIES YOUR HAIR IN NO TIME. I USED IT FOR MYSELF &amp; MY 12 YR OLD. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have short hair and use the medium setting and it takes no time to dry. It was a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> My dryer works perfectly! The hot is BLAZING hot and you will need a towel for your neck. I tried each of the settings to make sure they work just like they should. The cool setting is cool, not cold. No complaints here! Portable and compact! I will take it with me when I travel so my hair will always look good. I bought it at Brandsmart for only 34.88. Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> the best dryer my locs have ever experienced</li>
            <li> There is a twist clamp keeps the tube connected to the cap.  It sometimes comes apart and you have to reconnect.  Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> Very easy and convenient. Prefer this one over my hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> This item was very disappointing. When I unpacked it from the box and took it out of the plastic bag, it had fingerprints all over it and the plastic was casing was swirly and scratched, like someone had tried to clean it and sent it back. It was an embarrassing gift giving moment.</li>
            <li> This is a good bonnet hair dryer.  I like the hot and cool settings and the bonnet fits comfortably over my rather large head.  I have a lot of hair and I find that it dries evenly and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I brought this hair dryer to use on my husband dreads and occasional use by myself whenever I&#x27;m in the mood for a roller set. I love the color of it and all its compact departments. But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it Drys your hair fast but once u take your head out the dryer it seems as if it&#x27;s not as dry as u thought. In other words, my scalp be burning cause it&#x27;s so hot and it feels really dry but once u turn the heat off your hair feels a lil wet???... If this even make sense to anyone. Lol. Basically I like the product but I&#x27;m torn on its function.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have short hair and it&#x27;s dry in 30 minutes. Compact, neat, easy to store. I wish the cord was longer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for. The case has a slim design that makes it easy to store. The bonnet is a sturdy durable material. Now I can dry my hair in 15 while I put on my makeup and be ready to go. I tried hot rollers and they burned my scalp. I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> If only it wasn&#x27;t so loud!</li>
            <li> The original one pretty good but the new one is too LOUD and don&#x27;t care for. So 1st model gets 4 stars(does tend to get too hot) new model 1 star.</li>
            <li> really works well and folds yp like a dream</li>
            <li> i was excited that their were 3 heat settings.  The hot and warm setting felt the same HOT.  with a towel it should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using the cool setting which was warm. the hose kept un-hooking from the Bonnet like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;This is also loud on all heat settings so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;I have not decided if i will return to Amazon.  (I miss my old G.E. bonnet hair dryer that is no longer made.  ebay sometimes has used&lt;br /&gt;G.E. ones for sale.)</li>
            <li> It is the best product ever. I have locs. I just completed drying my locs with rollers in record time! Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I just got it on Saturday and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far. I really like it. It gets nice and hot and definitely cuts down the drying time on my thick natural hair. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s very compact, so once I was done with it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a hair dryer, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. But it does get REALLY hot. It has 2 settings: hot and cool. I used hot and sat under it for 30mins. My hair was really conditioned, but it left my scalp extremely dry. I have naturally dry scalp anyways though. So next time I&#x27;ll probably just cut the time in half and use the cool setting for the remainder 15mins. It fits around my whole head, with ajustable strings. It gets my whole head dry &amp; it seems to be really hot in the back of my head. The tubing also gets really hot so I have to wrap a towel around my neck and upper back/chest so it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. Other than that,  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVES IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife and she LOVE&#x27;s IT, Works Great and cuts her time to get ready by 75%. I Thank You Very Much.</li>
            <li> I like the settings the dryer has and the large bonnet.  The dryer works well and dries my hair throughly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. I use it for conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> So, I have curly hair.  I wanted to control my curls so they would be smooth and not dry and frizzy, etc...  So, I got this thing and the foam rollers and some hair slicker stuff.  After I shower I run the hair slicker stuff through my hair and then divide my hair onto medium sized foam rollers.  I put this baby on and WOW!  I LOVE IT!  The results look like I just left the salon (and by the way, I rarely go to the salon... I cut and color my own hair).  I&#x27;m thinking now, i could use this bonnet dryer to help set the color in my hair too.  It&#x27;s REALLY nice to sit here and use my computer as my hair is being done for me... and with beautiful results!  Now if I could figure out a way for a machine to straighten my hair while I&#x27;m sitting here instead of me spending an hour blowing my hair straight - that would be a miracle!!!  :)  The temperature on this bonnet is perfect.  It has a cold shot so I can set my style after my hair is dry.  I just use one of those hair clipy things to hold the bonnet to my head instead of the drawstring shoe lace things it comes with.  It is noisy, like a hair dryer, but that should be expected.  My hair looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this 3 stars because I was sitting using it and it got lukewarm at best.  So I was going to say it would be good for naturals who wet set and want to speed up the drying process without really using heat....Then I saw the heat and cool button that was kind of hiding under the air tube and whoa momma.  I had to grab a towel for my neck.  This was awesome, awesome awesome in speed drying my twist out!!!! My hair is super thick and long so I have thick twist wrapped around my head and barbie pinned and the air still got through it.  I can&#x27;t wait to try a roller set.  I was getting ready to give Laila the side eye for putting her name on a mediocre product.  I feel like she has values and would do the right thing and that she did.  The pro&#x27;s are: Its so simple to operate. There is a high/low buttons that can be used cool high/low or heat high/low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty little purple casing.  The hood itself is phenomenal for a home dryer at this price point.  The air comes out all over the hood...so there are no hot spots and because the air is coming out all over the hood, it causes the hood to lift itself during the drying process so it doesn&#x27;t sit on your head it creates a room above your head where the air circulates similar to salon dryers.  It is so easy to operate.  Literally you open the box, plug it in, tie the ties at the rear....very good hood and hit the on button.  Quality, quality product.  As long as Laila continues to invest in promoting quality products I will give it a shot.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve needed to replace my old overhead dryer for the longest.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this.</li>
            <li> I like this product because its very convenient and gets the job done. I usually sit in bed watching tv with this on my head! The negatives is it does tend to get really hot sometimes so you dont want it touching your direct skin, it also does tend to unhook from the cord and bonnet which is annoying because you have to keep installing it. It is very easy to pack, relatively small, I place it right in the corner of my bed and side table.</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer for a trip to the beach.  I am relaxed, and did not want to use a hand dryer to style my hair after getting it wet.  This dryer was just what I needed.  It did a great job at drying my hair &amp; my hair felt moisturized after use.  This is a great buy if you need a traveling hood dryer.</li>
            <li> the bonnets waaaaaay too big and its poorly made... it gets hot but all of the heat escapes because of the oversized bonnet. dont buy this thing!</li>
            <li> I have owned bonnet hair dryers in the past and I just used this one for the first time tonight and I Love it.  Took me about a minute to make sure I had the cap on right all the who.e my teenage girls laughed at me.lol. It never got too hot so this dryer will get lots of use by me,</li>
            <li> The older model was quite and efficient. This new one is so loud. It is more compact but the motor runs as loud as a regular hair dryer.  Not relaxing at all. I have been a huge fan of laila dryers until they switched the design. One star. Coming from a cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> This works just as I hoped, so my hair is dry in 10min or less. The plastic hood is sized by a pull tie, and the scrunched plastic is annoying at the hairline. Might not be a problem if I used rollers, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works wonders on all hair types.  Me and my sister use this so much that she decided to get her own.  We got our friends to invest in this product and we all save so much money buying using this.  It&#x27;s like going to the salon but in the comfort of anywhere you decide to use it. I would say the ONLY downside to this product is that the long part that connects to the head piece from the machine is too short, but hey if you can make it work then this product is for you and gets the job done!!!</li>
            <li> I got this on time &amp; it is great for deep conditioning. Also, it doesnt get cold after a long period of time. It stays hot and is durable.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item - exactly (even better in fact) then I had expected!  It works beautifully - my hair is extremely thick, naturally curly (with a great tendency to &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;) and shoulder lenght.  I use extra large rollers, put the soft bonnet on and click on the button (you have a choice of 4 settings: high - hot/ high - cool/ low - hot/ low - cool) I use high/hot for 10 minutes and then 10 minutes on high-low and within 20 minutes of sitting under my soft bonnet - reading a book, doing a crossword, my hair is soft, bouncy, shiny, and I am so, so happy with it!  100% recommended purchase!  It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. I have already used it a couple of times and it works wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it is hot enough to dry the hair within 30 minutes (and I have long hair). Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally getting around to write this review. I hate this dryer. I can&#x27;t keep it on my head! When I turn it on and tie it up, it flys off of my head. Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> TOO HOT - even on medium! LOUD! Bonnet DISCONNECTS from hose...with any movement.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This dryer is the best. I love the versatilty of the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;It can be adjusted to fit tighter for deep conditioning and looser for roller sets.  It dried my natural hair super fast. I love that I am not limited to sitting at s table trying to find the right height.  Believe me you won&#x27;t be dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. It does what they say it does. It leaves her hair softer, not hard. And it dries faster than her other model.  SW</li>
            <li> The dryer is VERY loud and even the low temperature is too hot. I do not recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this dryer a must buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I am African American with 3c/4a hair type.  I use this for my deep conditioning treatments once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  It has worked well with my treatments.  I love that it is portable, can be easily set up anywhere.You don&#x27;t have to worry about using phone books to balance it. Use it for roller sets also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The only complaint is, which i expect because its using heat, is that it gets hot around the neck area. My solution is to put a towel around the neck under the bonnet an tie down.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bonnet and very portable.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer so much spit does exactly what it says I would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Order placed Saturday, June 1, 2013 with expedited Shipping &amp; Handling $25.46. On Monday, June 3, 2013 received a call/email at night from a representative stating the item is on back order and was available sometime the beginning of next week. Being a hairstylist I order the item after reading many reviews and watching a short video posted By IsaP \\&quot;Isa\\&quot; (Claremont, CA). I&#x27;m Very disappointed that the item wasn&#x27;t available, needed it for a client that was schedule for a hair appointment on Saturday June 8, 2013. This is my first order that had to be cancelled and still awaiting a refund. Called Amazon they stated to call Vender, called vender they stated to call my bank to funds released? Really *Recommend if anyone is considering purchasing this bonnet dryer to contact the seller first via email or phone. Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t comment and leave negative feedback but this has been very disappointing and huge inconvenience.  -Marty the Hair Stylist</li>
