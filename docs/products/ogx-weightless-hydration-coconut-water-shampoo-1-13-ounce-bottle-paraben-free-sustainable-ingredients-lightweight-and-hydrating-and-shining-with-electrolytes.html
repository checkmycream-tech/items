            <li>My hair feels and looks great.</li>

            <li>Good quality for the price you pay</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>My scalp felt amazingly moisturized after one day of not using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it smells great, doesn&#x27;t overly lather, and leaves my hair clean for an additional 1-2 days to extend time between washes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular formula at Ulta, great deal when combining the coupon they offer!</li>
            <li>We love this shampoo, its light and smells delish and leaves hair feeling great</li>
            <li>Light, Pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo - very gentle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a gel which foams up very nicely, has a nice light coconut scent (that isn&#x27;t too strong like most shampoos).  </li>
            <li>It is good but not anything special in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have pretty damaged hair at the moment, my ends are britt brittle at the moment but the healthy hair at my scalp gets so oily!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews and personally, I love the way it cleans my hair.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my hair, so this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells like coconut candy and leaves my hair smooth!</li>
            <li>So far, I am loving this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it!  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than I could fine here in hawaii same great product</li>
            <li>I wanted something that&#x27;s light and not too perfumy...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good so far.  </li>
            <li>This is the FIRST shampoo I have ever used that I didn&#x27;t need to use a conditioner with!!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not sulfate free, my hair feels light and clean when I use.</li>
            <li>days and my hair smells and looks clean (not greasy).</li>
            <li>Cleans my and my wife&#x27;s hair and leaves it feeling clean and non-olly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool, beachy scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild, but still noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brand and this scent in general.</li>
            <li>I will be experimenting with other products from this line but do far the coconut water is working great.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this is subtle but beautiful.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This hair product was exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i try this brand and also coconut shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to the OGX repairing formula which doesn&#x27;t knot my hair up, unless I find another formula of theirs that I like better.</li>
            <li>However it is SLS free, cleanses very well (after two shampoos each time, in my case), leaves very little build-up (important for my chronically dry scalp) and is a great fairly priced alternative to more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>With that said, my hair gets pretty dry (shshsh), but I&#x27;ve always been asked how my hair manages to look and stay healthy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the positive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives, my hair tangled so easily while using it in the shower, I had to use a different brand of conditioner just to try to get out the tangles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend leave hair weightless and shiny and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>i love ogx, cant go wrong here and the prices here are just AMAZING</li>
            <li>I really could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally long, fine and straight and prone to matting.</li>
            <li>My hair is just as soft and easy to brush as it was when using heavy leave in conditioners, only now it is lighter feeling and has more volume.</li>
            <li>Went back to the regular variant shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li>from an island, so with the high humidity here, I know &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34; is highly used by locals...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have used other shampoos by this company and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It really cleans the scalp and hair without completely drying it out..</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding shampoo as my hair gets oily very quickly and is easily weight down.  </li>
            <li>When I rinse my hair, it feels soft and silky plus it dries nice and doesn&#x27;t dry frizzy either like the other</li>
            <li>Quality of shampoo is paramount,  takes very little and suds up well,  as a very light scent of coconut when finished not heavy.</li>
            <li>I tried it at a friend&#x27;s house for the first time and it only took one wash to feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have very thick hair, and this shampoo made my hair feel thinner, softer, and more manageable!</li>
            <li>So far, no problems.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is weightless, my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Matt</li>
            <li>Brings out the natural colors with shine and fullness.</li>
            <li>also the fragrance is light enough to not cause issues with my other sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or too faint, cleans my scalp very well and leaves my hair feeling very soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It may be a bit pricey for the drugstore, but I think it gives you the same effects you&#x27;d get with much higher end (and much more expensive) shampoos.</li>
            <li>I heard the hype about the Organix line and tried a previous product (Macademia, brown and green product) on my natural hair but was not in love.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and shiny after only one use.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle pretty thick and gets very sudsy.</li>
            <li>However, some shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve used give me &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; and really weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo (expensive, organic, cheap) to try and keep my hair soft and preserve the hair color.</li>

            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo (expensive, organic, cheap) to try and keep my hair soft and preserve the hair color.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day just so that I don&#x27;t strip my hair of the natural oils.</li>
            <li> but there was a noticeable different in my hair after only two uses when compared to using other shampoos and conditioners in the OGX line:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with dirty blonde, wavy hair (which you&#x27;re not supposed to brush, I know), so maybe it would work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li> The hair was way easier to blow dry and it has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> My hair is not that frizzy to begin with, but I take my showers at night and in the morning my hair is usually all rumpled, with this shampoo there is zero frizz, just soft waves.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair less soft than it usually is and makes my scalp itches.</li>
            <li> (Thick African American hair)</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle , makes your hair soft but leaves it with volume.</li>
            <li> that OGX&#x27;s hair care products are greener than other hair care products in their price range.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and it is difficult to find a relatively inexpensive shampoo that is compatible.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a lightweight shampoo for my short, thick hair</li>
            <li> I can leave my hair down on the &amp;#34;unshampooed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> still have some frizz but much less.</li>
            <li> They had a worse rating than garner fructis on a scale testing quality of ingredients, social responsibility, etc.</li>
            <li> did* look shinier, but it looked weighed down!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the shampoo or the conditioner specifically</li>
            <li> It leaves a heavy sort of crusty stiffness behind and my hair drooped.</li>
            <li> I do not like writing negative reviews, but this shampoo was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we lasted using it about 2.5 weeks and switched.</li>
            <li> This variant is just an awful waste of money.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks my scalp started to hurt, and bad.</li>
            <li> My sons had horrible build up on their scalps.</li>

            <li> what do i say? wonderful stuff!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something for my weave to bring it back in life. I heard the hype about the Organix line and tried a previous product (Macademia, brown and green product) on my natural hair but was not in love. It was on sale and I thought to myself, hey try it because it says weightless yet moisturizing. Tried it and I can say I do notice a difference. I used both the shampoo and conditioner and saw and felt a difference. The hair was way easier to blow dry and it has a glow to it. I left a star out because I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why the name is organix and there only 2 &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products in it.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT! Not too strong or too faint, cleans my scalp very well and leaves my hair feeling very soft and bouncy. (Thick African American hair)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Although it&#x27;s not sulfate free, my hair feels light and clean when I use.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo, its light and smells delish and leaves hair feeling great</li>
            <li> Quality of shampoo is paramount,  takes very little and suds up well,  as a very light scent of coconut when finished not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews and personally, I love the way it cleans my hair. I dye my hair every color you can think of...yes, friends call me a chameleon lol! With that said, my hair gets pretty dry (shshsh), but I&#x27;ve always been asked how my hair manages to look and stay healthy...I wash my hair every other day just so that I don&#x27;t strip my hair of the natural oils. And I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo (expensive, organic, cheap) to try and keep my hair soft and preserve the hair color. However, some shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve used give me &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; and really weighs down my hair. The days I don&#x27;t shampoo, I would have to put it up in a hair clip, cause I could smell &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; and shampoo/conditioner build up (Yuck)! I wanted something that&#x27;s light and not too perfumy...THIS SHAMPOO IS AWESOME!!!! I can leave my hair down on the &amp;#34;unshampooed&amp;#34; days and my hair smells and looks clean (not greasy). It comes out of the bottle pretty thick and gets very sudsy. When I rinse my hair, it feels soft and silky plus it dries nice and doesn&#x27;t dry frizzy either like the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m from an island, so with the high humidity here, I know &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34; is highly used by locals...I just don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my hair, so this is the next best thing. Hope this helps with your decision.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST shampoo I have ever used that I didn&#x27;t need to use a conditioner with!! My hair is just as soft and easy to brush as it was when using heavy leave in conditioners, only now it is lighter feeling and has more volume. My hair is naturally long, fine and straight and prone to matting. So far, no problems. Also, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out on my chin like a lot of shampoos do when I switch brands. WIll definitely be sticking with this!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell from the bottle but it smelled different when using it on my hair. It left my hair less soft than it usually is and makes my scalp itches.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cleans my and my wife&#x27;s hair and leaves it feeling clean and non-olly. We will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love this product . The scent is subtle , makes your hair soft but leaves it with volume. Good price too !</li>
            <li> The weirdest part of this shampoo is the gel like consistency when pouring. Otherwise, it smells great, doesn&#x27;t overly lather, and leaves my hair clean for an additional 1-2 days to extend time between washes.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo- still have some frizz but much less.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I have trouble finding shampoo as my hair gets oily very quickly and is easily weight down.  This shampoo is weightless, my hair is soft and shiny.  My hair is not that frizzy to begin with, but I take my showers at night and in the morning my hair is usually all rumpled, with this shampoo there is zero frizz, just soft waves.  I recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because it was on sale and I thought great, Ogx&#x3D;organic. No. They had a worse rating than garner fructis on a scale testing quality of ingredients, social responsibility, etc. however, I did not look at that until about 2 weeks after my family started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the positive. It smells great! And the fragrance lasts. It kept my hair shiny. And, that is about all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives, my hair tangled so easily while using it in the shower, I had to use a different brand of conditioner just to try to get out the tangles. But it smelled so good, I kept using it. After about 2 weeks my scalp started to hurt, and bad. It started getting itchy. My sons had horrible build up on their scalps. My husband said his scalp was itchy, then whe he scratched it, he had a lot of build up under his nails. Needless to say, we lasted using it about 2.5 weeks and switched. My scalp felt amazingly moisturized after one day of not using this shampoo. Our scalps are still healing. I do not like writing negative reviews, but this shampoo was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> i love ogx, cant go wrong here and the prices here are just AMAZING</li>
            <li> Needed shampoo while visiting Hawaii and found this.  It&#x27;s basically a gel which foams up very nicely, has a nice light coconut scent (that isn&#x27;t too strong like most shampoos).  Works well for hair and whole-body in one go.  Couldn&#x27;t bring it back with me on the plane when I came home so I got on Amazon and bought a bunch.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Matt</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and smooth.  Light, Pleasant fragrance.  love it</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Brings out the natural colors with shine and fullness.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;ve only used it once, I can already notice a difference. I recommend this shampoo if you have oily yet frizzy hair like mine. It really cleans the scalp and hair without completely drying it out.. Also, I have very thick hair, and this shampoo made my hair feel thinner, softer, and more manageable!</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and it is difficult to find a relatively inexpensive shampoo that is compatible. this is it. also the fragrance is light enough to not cause issues with my other sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This Organix (OGX) Coconut Water shampoo is indeed weightless.  The fragrance is mild, but still noticeable.  This product is NOT organic nor is it even remotely all natural.  However it is SLS free, cleanses very well (after two shampoos each time, in my case), leaves very little build-up (important for my chronically dry scalp) and is a great fairly priced alternative to more expensive brands.  I purchased this particular formula at Ulta, great deal when combining the coupon they offer!</li>
            <li> It is good but not anything special in my opinion. I do like it though.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this shampoo. The scent of this is subtle but beautiful. It&#x27;s a cool, beachy scent. It made my hair so soft and shiny after only one use. I really could tell a difference. It may be a bit pricey for the drugstore, but I think it gives you the same effects you&#x27;d get with much higher end (and much more expensive) shampoos. I am hoping they&#x27;ll put this scent in a body wash one day. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling GREAT!! I highly recommend leave hair weightless and shiny and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brand and this scent in general. I have used other shampoos by this company and this one is by far my favorite. My hair feels and looks great. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than I could fine here in hawaii same great product</li>
            <li> Causes buildup - flaky, itchy scalp! DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a lightweight shampoo for my short, thick hair but it turned out to be just the opposite. It leaves a heavy sort of crusty stiffness behind and my hair drooped. This variant is just an awful waste of money. Went back to the regular variant shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li> Hair stays noticeably smoother and healthier for days</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it!  I tried it at a friend&#x27;s house for the first time and it only took one wash to feel a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and it&#x27;s good so far.  I have pretty damaged hair at the moment, my ends are britt brittle at the moment but the healthy hair at my scalp gets so oily!!  I will be experimenting with other products from this line but do far the coconut water is working great.  Good quality for the price you pay (in stores, anyway, it&#x27;s a bit pricey on Amazon).</li>
            <li> This hair product was exactly what I had hoped for.  It leaves my hair silky smooth, soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i try this brand and also coconut shampoo. I must say i am loving it! Smells like coconut candy and leaves my hair smooth!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the shampoo or the conditioner specifically and I did only use them twice but there was a noticeable different in my hair after only two uses when compared to using other shampoos and conditioners in the OGX line: my hair *did* look shinier, but it looked weighed down! It also knotted up and hurt to brush out. I&#x27;m Caucasian with dirty blonde, wavy hair (which you&#x27;re not supposed to brush, I know), so maybe it would work better for other hair types. Not for me. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing. I&#x27;ll go back to the OGX repairing formula which doesn&#x27;t knot my hair up, unless I find another formula of theirs that I like better. I like that OGX&#x27;s hair care products are greener than other hair care products in their price range.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - very gentle! I hadn&#x27;t tried any without sulfates before and I can feel the difference now. It&#x27;s not as harsh.</li>
