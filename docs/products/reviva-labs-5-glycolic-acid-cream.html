    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this glycolic acid cream!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But this stuff is wonderful (but burns)!</li>
            <li>Excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I know people that have used this and had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>However, I think its best as a night cream as the glycolic acid might not work well during the day if you are wearing sunscreen</li>
            <li>I think this 5% glycolic cream is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>Every time I do my skin glows and looks wonderful for days.</li>

            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t even care, still AMAZING!</li>

            <li>and it is a good price.</li>
            <li>but my skin has never ever ever ever been this good.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The price is good, though.  </li>
            <li>Very Nice and Effective</li>
            <li>get my skin looking beautiful and healthy...</li>
            <li>I read up on the best wrinkle reducing cream and the glycolic acid was definitely what I found to be the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It sure did!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is a MUCH better price than I could find in person!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>like this was an impulse buy, but I am so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>and so glad I did!</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>but the improvement is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing....</li>
            <li>get through the intial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase and your skill will look amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 now and my skin just isn&#x27;t so amazing anymore.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing...</li>
            <li>You have to give it a month or two before your skin really starts to look great!</li>
            <li>from that day I can honestly see my blemishes fading.</li>
            <li>; You will get some peeling, redness, and dryness, this is where the moisturizer come in handy.</li>
            <li>This product works great to almost do a mild peel, while keeping my skin moist.</li>
            <li>Best for removes scalps acne and old cell, no painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>USE A STRONG MOISTURIZER!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants a beautiful glow..</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin ,so to find a product that I can use every nigh is incredible.</li>
            <li>but soon as you add a moisturizer on top it stops.</li>
            <li>I purchased this through a pharmacy website because i have been sent counterfeit lotions/cosmetics through amazon too many times.</li>
            <li>but it appears to be working okay.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to do</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted to try this product to reduce pore size.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I truly love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should&#x27;ve used the 10%, but this formula wasn&#x27;t the magic ticket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream for years and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I just purchased 10% Glycolic Acid cream as it was advised by many people.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks definitely much more moisturized  and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did not stop applying</li>
            <li>like I said before, I haven&#x27;t used it for more than two weeks yet.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this cream.</li>
            <li>Then I tried acne.org and it was okay</li>
            <li>Anyway, since my acne comes and goes I&#x27;ve basically tried most of what&#x27;s out there with no permanent results.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for thicker skin.</li>
            <li>The new skin that it reveals is beautiful and truly the way we are suppose to look.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first and they sounded good</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and my complexion is evening out. :}&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took my some time to figure out that this cream was the culprit, primarily because i was convinced that since it worked for everybody (well most of the people reviewing it), it&#x27;ll work for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks now and it has completely re-surfaced my skin for the better!!</li>
            <li>Excellent value and results compared to other creams twice the price.</li>
            <li>This product will make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so do use a good moisturize with sunblock/uv protection; the sun doesn&#x27;t discriminate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be 53 soon, and I do use a strong sunscreen already.</li>
            <li>works well, not too strong</li>
            <li>I never get anything more than temporary irritation and my skin looks good, clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, Product is great, tingles a little, but says it would, Love it!</li>
            <li>The quality of one&#x27;s skin is mostly hereditary and as long as one uses a good moisturizer, eats a fairly healthy diet and gets some exercise, that is about all you can do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, effective, and really light weight.</li>
            <li>Its great to finally find something that works.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and blemish free.  </li>
            <li>Recommend to everyone with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman of color and didn&#x27;t want to use something that was going to lighten my skin tone, just smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Start extremely lightly...</li>
            <li>my skin looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have found that with age and sun exposure etc by skin does not glow as it use , so I decided to try a light chemical</li>
            <li>I apply a light oil of olay moisturiser with SPF in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it only as a night treatment and it works great under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I ENJOY</li>
            <li>As far as the results it render; GOOD.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, wow does my skin look good after about two weeks of alternating glycolic 5% with retin a.</li>
            <li>its is good so far.</li>
            <li>It honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much to help with pore reduction, but it&#x27;s caused a significant improvement in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>This product has been altered from the original formula.</li>
            <li>Either way though, I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what I would look like in a month or two.</li>
            <li>I have noticed contained acne control and significant reduction in my finest wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin tone has significantly evened out and I don&#x27;t have anymore breakouts.</li>
            <li>This has made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I am confident that you will certainly see the result you desired.</li>
            <li>I am also older (60) and might be too far gone, LOL.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product to use for starting out, but should certainly be paired with a good sunscreen (I live in the desert and can *feel</li>
            <li>Also ordered a few others and hoping they are equally awesome because the price point is so much lower on this brand than most that I am currently using and not even really loving.</li>
            <li>I love this and find that my skin is much brighter since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, it has not been effective at all for me.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, product works okay</li>
            <li>It is much smoother to the touch and more</li>
            <li>I would say it was about 4-5 days before I noticed the difference, but my skin looks much fresher and more youthful.  </li>
            <li>Yes I really like this cream, but it will break out your skin, so be sure to apply medicated cream after this soaks into yours</li>
            <li>Although I am always being told I have a good complexion and people think I am younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>I would say that it is not bad for a moisturizer, but not a miracle worker, either.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be blessed with great skin: clear, creamy, poreless--the kind that&#x27;s always getting compliments and warnings from older ladies to take care of and protect it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say a mild cleanser with this product is a safe bet for anyone who wants to get rid of their acne.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that is pretty strong</li>
            <li>I have seen the lines around my eyes diminish tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It may be good for 40 year old skin that shouldn&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>I found a good natural night cream, but really missed the way the glycolic acid clarified my skin.</li>
            <li>I have mildly oily skin.</li>
            <li>no breakouts even for someone who is still super oily age 51.  </li>
            <li>I switched to a soap-free, mild cleanser, and since then - no acne and no dryness.  </li>
            <li>I have sun damaged and super wrinkles it seems to be doing something</li>
            <li>It tingles but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Thanks to other reviewers warning to avoid eye area, for I do feel it tightening under the eyes, and not in a good way!</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected it to be, nicely package and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I applied since 5 days , great results,Pimple scars are almost gone ,pimples are dried out</li>
            <li>It does smooth my skin and very gradually reduce the size of keratoses on my face.</li>
            <li>It works very well with Reviva Labs Light Skin Peel.</li>
            <li>so far pleased</li>
            <li>I used cetaphil daily moisturizing cream (great for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>I usually use Differing gel with great results but because it is a retinol, I cannot use it while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I use this along with several other products, but it has been a great addition!</li>
            <li>I still get the odd pimple or two -- most prominent when I run out of my cream and haven&#x27;t bought any more -- but it performs better than I ever expected!      </li>
            <li>This little jar of cream is amazing !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced very little stinging sensation as opposed to what some others have reported.  </li>
            <li>but then i easily spot treat with peroxide and the rest of my skin is left smooth .</li>
            <li>With longer use--and good moisturizers--wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few times to get use to the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, it really works it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I will have better feel of it after few more weeks of using.</li>
            <li>tried it once so far so can&#x27;t really tell yet if it&#x27;s gonna make my skin look any better</li>
            <li>I realize this is too soon to report on the effects the cream might have on my acne scars and fine lines, but I wanted to leave this review now because I have just had such an amazing and incomparable success with this product as a cystic and other acne treatment</li>
            <li>Very very liquid ..</li>
            <li>I can get away with skipping my tinted moisturizer and looking good with a little concealer and some blush.  </li>
            <li>Try this first before the 10%</li>
            <li>so they are not as purple but more white.</li>
            <li>I am 35 , using for the first time .</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the stuff burned/tingled.</li>
            <li>However the next morning my skin looked fabulous!.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more then moderate changes, I would refer you to the reviews of Rivva Labs with a higher Glycolic Acid level.</li>
            <li>Remember, it&#x27;s your face; the first vision people see, be cautious...</li>
            <li>I will be more faithful now &amp; use it daily.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>works very well-heard about glycolic acid on--dr oz!  </li>
            <li>Ultimately you have to know your skin and be able to gauge it&#x27;s tolerance.</li>
            <li>I did flake a bit at first, but nothing like when I started retin</li>
            <li>Now I just need to be better about using this stuff regularly.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product and most definitely this supplier to anyone.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial cream.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more for a larger tub of the product.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time in my life that I use any acid on my skin.at</li>
            <li>I put it on for the first time and whiteheads that I&#x27;ve had for YEARS</li>
            <li>have used this product for a month now, I am running out of my first container.</li>
            <li>put this on as per the directions (\\&quot;for the first four weeks:</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice brighter,smoother skin first time you use it.</li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk, my skin is free from scne and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I order it Monday night and got it same week Wednesday afternoon :)</li>
            <li>My skin peeled the first day while on this glycolic acid but to be frank any type of peeling</li>
            <li>It performs wonders for my skin and the 5% is not too harsh on my fair, freckled skin.</li>
            <li>Took it for granted that it&#x27;d look amazing forever, ignored the advice, and when I turned 30 all those years of sunbathing and partying/social-smoking in my early 20&#x27;s seemed to suddenly catch up with me.  </li>
            <li>keeps acne at bay, clears skin, reduces dark spots/acne scars AND makes skin look bright, tight and healthy.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and feels polished all the time now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out the drier areas on my face, but it does manage to take care of the more oily and pimple prone areas.</li>
            <li>When it feels too dry, use some moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>Did research on glycolic acid and learned that it is strong stuff, so I opted for the 5% option and only use it according to directions in the evening...</li>
            <li>I used 5 days after pure glycolic acid peel 70%,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain it was the Reviva, maybe it was a change in diet?</li>
            <li>I have seen and felt pretty significant results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, i had very high hopes</li>
            <li>Warning: do not put over cuts because it really stings.</li>
            <li>Ordered on June 22 , I received on 25th , fast delivery by AllStarHealth.com  via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I havent really noticed a change in my acne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>I have seen not so much of a difference.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend to everyone skipping this one and going straight to 10% for faster results.</li>
            <li>It really has done the trick.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on my over 55 skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really think this would do much.</li>
            <li>and I think it works really well.</li>
            <li>I have very oil, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s really working all that well.</li>
            <li>I also use X Out by Proactive, but that alone didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>But i was really wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say I used this product nightly for a month straight and noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see too much difference from my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it day and night/One month day-one month night/Works very well.</li>
            <li>And I have never had any remedy whatsoever, prescription, home, OTC, do anything much for my cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything much for my skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every night.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream, For Both Aging and Problem Skin, 1.5 Ounces (42 g)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>near mediocre at best is what i see</li>
            <li>I am excited about using the next one!</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients in this product, and it really makes a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to stop a red bump from turning into a full grown zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mail-order acne treatment solutions and pretty much everything they have to offer at grocery stores, and this is the first thing that has worked well for my skin without totally drying it out or breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I plan to order the 10% next and see if that does more; I will report back and if not, continue using the 5% until I am older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product I received was either a returned item, very old or is not the real deal/counterfit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of almost totally clear skin, over the last 6 months I have gotten some stubborn acne on parts of my face and this has cleared up significantly during the use of this cream.</li>
            <li>Working very well so far,  have not used the 10% yet as it has not been a month as the trial period recommends.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin greasy to where i dont even need a moisturizer, and i dont normally have greasy skin.</li>
            <li>Not alot now but enough for me to think that the price of this product is worth anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate a few times a week, too.</li>
            <li>I still use my normal night cream along with this.  </li>
            <li>After discovering this product, I don&#x27;t want to live without it and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>, this product and other reviews said it helped with fine lines, fading scars, and \\&quot;problem skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I did ALOT research to find that very few things are safe for pregnant women, glycolic acid being only one of the few that are SAFE.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is much more balanced and my breakouts have been less frequent.</li>
            <li>started using this a week ago right before applying the Porcelana and it has made a BIG difference.  </li>
            <li>every other or two day rest..exfoliate lightly to get max results...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a little early for me to say for sure, but I have noticed some improvement.</li>
            <li>I would wake up with 4 new pimples BEFORE the glycolic acid (I&#x27;m a picker btw</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been one week and NOT one new pimple</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft from using this cream and it really helps with the soft lines around my eyes....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Stings a little (surprisingly it feels no different to me than the same brand 10% cream) but does the job.</li>
            <li>Almost done with the first jar and definitely seeing the result.</li>
            <li>It has completely evened out my skin tone, smoothed my complexion and stopped any new pimples.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation with this, minimal peeling that is quickly dealt with by using an exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>I have never written a single product review before, but I wanted to let all women out there know that this is product completely worth it and will change how you think about your skin.</li>
            <li>So glad I did, for I&#x27;m pretty tight faced using every other night with retin a.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend that step because you may need to figure out a proper exfoliation routine to make sure that you don&#x27;t get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t clear it up</li>
            <li>In the packaging it clearly states that the 10% is for those that have used the 5%.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had really congested pores from failing to wash my make up off nightly, and this made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>but there wasn&#x27;t any improvement on my 70 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I am young but I wanted this to help clear up my acne and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I tried a natural Retinol but am 62 years old, and it was way too drying.</li>
            <li>I get the occasional pimple and this product really helps.  </li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I leave on and enjoy the sizable tingle for a few minutes then add a layer of daytime moisturizer or at night Suki Nourishing Oil</li>
            <li>just ordered the 10% because I am completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients and observable benefits.</li>
            <li>I have terribly sensitive skin so ,using this product was a leap of faith.</li>
            <li>This product has met my expectations so far.  </li>
            <li>I have not gotten any breakouts while using it and the old ones that were there before have shrunk considerably.</li>
            <li>This should be a cream and what I received was very soupy/runny and had no inner seal.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old woman.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when applied to my face.</li>
            <li>My acne comes and goes but at 28 years old you&#x27;d think this stage would be over.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sign that the old skin is coming off.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to do nothing for me as far as I could tell.  </li>
            <li>be forewarned, it does sting the first few times you use it, but it really works!</li>
            <li>virtually ALL of my cystic was GONE and my other acne was really cleared up!!</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter, pores reduced significantly, and no more ruddiness (hope it prevents ruddiness in winter, when I almost look like I have rosacea!)</li>
            <li>first gets red and a little itchy,but in a few minutes the discomfort disappears and my skin looks very good and very firm.</li>
            <li>I have small moles; compliments of our lovely sun &amp; not using sunblock earlier in life.</li>
            <li>Kind of awkward at first, do use it once a week, then gradually work up to &amp;#34;Once</li>
            <li>but it actually started causing acne, even though i dont normally have it.</li>
            <li>Normally, I purchase from a local store but decided to order online.</li>
            <li>I have been using Reviva 5% glycolic for at least two months and it has given me the best clear skin,after having skin problems for decades and using expensive prescriptions and glycolic peels done by a derm.</li>
            <li>Really improves the appearance of my face in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I did find a pricey moisturizer at one point that simply did not cause more acne and was supposed to help with wrinkles, but I found it was not effective in the wrinkle dept.</li>
            <li>first couple weeks, I used it every other day.</li>
            <li>, I thought other customers might be interested.</li>
            <li>And I will say that the fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead are smoother for at least 24 hours after using cream.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be helping the tiny bumps I have on my face.</li>
            <li>I got this on a whim and after a week of use cannot imagine this not being part of my essential natural beauty care regime.</li>
            <li>The lines on my face are not deep since I am in my early 30&#x27;s, but this made them nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I have always used herbal and natural products on my skin, such as shea butter and coconut oil and</li>
            <li>I only apply at night after washing with a bar of Dove or Olay for sensitive skin soap and I moisturize in the morning before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I have used other more expensive products; however, this works as well or better for less money.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>It stung a little when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Long story short, I got the 5 % once my skin came back to normal and</li>
            <li>I have been using other prescription acne products (retin-A and a topical antibiotic) for several years, but I am going through a very prolonged and stressful time in my life and they just stopped working at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, tends to be dry</li>
            <li>It does burn a little bit in certain areas but nothing unbearable at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if I use this product at least once a day, every day it works very very well!</li>
            <li>it helped cool down the slight burning instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Thick and rich cream, one jar lasts a long time!</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> Excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I know people that have used this and had wonderful results.</li>
            <li> However, I think its best as a night cream as the glycolic acid might not work well during the day if you are wearing sunscreen</li>

            <li> Every time I do my skin glows and looks wonderful for days.</li>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>

            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t even care, still AMAZING!</li>

            <li> After cystic acne and two courses of accurane, my looked good, but this is taking care of my remaining scars.  </li>
            <li> good product and shipping</li>

            <li> but my skin has never ever ever ever been this good.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The price is good, though.  </li>

            <li> get my skin looking beautiful and healthy...</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> like this was an impulse buy, but I am so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> and so glad I did!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> but the improvement is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing....</li>
            <li> get through the intial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase and your skill will look amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 now and my skin just isn&#x27;t so amazing anymore.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...</li>
            <li> You have to give it a month or two before your skin really starts to look great!</li>
            <li> from that day I can honestly see my blemishes fading.</li>
            <li> ; You will get some peeling, redness, and dryness, this is where the moisturizer come in handy.</li>
            <li> This product works great to almost do a mild peel, while keeping my skin moist.</li>
            <li> Best for removes scalps acne and old cell, no painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> USE A STRONG MOISTURIZER!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a beautiful glow..</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin ,so to find a product that I can use every nigh is incredible.</li>
            <li> but soon as you add a moisturizer on top it stops.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through a pharmacy website because i have been sent counterfeit lotions/cosmetics through amazon too many times.</li>
            <li> but it appears to be working okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to do</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted to try this product to reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I truly love it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should&#x27;ve used the 10%, but this formula wasn&#x27;t the magic ticket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream for years and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I just purchased 10% Glycolic Acid cream as it was advised by many people.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks definitely much more moisturized  and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did not stop applying</li>
            <li> like I said before, I haven&#x27;t used it for more than two weeks yet.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cream.</li>
            <li> Then I tried acne.org and it was okay</li>
            <li> Anyway, since my acne comes and goes I&#x27;ve basically tried most of what&#x27;s out there with no permanent results.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for thicker skin.</li>
            <li> The new skin that it reveals is beautiful and truly the way we are suppose to look.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first and they sounded good</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and my complexion is evening out. :}&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took my some time to figure out that this cream was the culprit, primarily because i was convinced that since it worked for everybody (well most of the people reviewing it), it&#x27;ll work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now and it has completely re-surfaced my skin for the better!!</li>
            <li> Excellent value and results compared to other creams twice the price.</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so do use a good moisturize with sunblock/uv protection; the sun doesn&#x27;t discriminate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 53 soon, and I do use a strong sunscreen already.</li>
            <li> works well, not too strong</li>
            <li> I never get anything more than temporary irritation and my skin looks good, clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Product is great, tingles a little, but says it would, Love it!</li>
            <li> The quality of one&#x27;s skin is mostly hereditary and as long as one uses a good moisturizer, eats a fairly healthy diet and gets some exercise, that is about all you can do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, effective, and really light weight.</li>
            <li> Its great to finally find something that works.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and blemish free.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to everyone with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color and didn&#x27;t want to use something that was going to lighten my skin tone, just smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Start extremely lightly...</li>
            <li> my skin looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have found that with age and sun exposure etc by skin does not glow as it use , so I decided to try a light chemical</li>
            <li> I apply a light oil of olay moisturiser with SPF in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it only as a night treatment and it works great under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ENJOY</li>
            <li> As far as the results it render; GOOD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, wow does my skin look good after about two weeks of alternating glycolic 5% with retin a.</li>
            <li> its is good so far.</li>
            <li> It honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much to help with pore reduction, but it&#x27;s caused a significant improvement in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> This product has been altered from the original formula.</li>
            <li> Either way though, I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what I would look like in a month or two.</li>
            <li> I have noticed contained acne control and significant reduction in my finest wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin tone has significantly evened out and I don&#x27;t have anymore breakouts.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I am confident that you will certainly see the result you desired.</li>
            <li> I am also older (60) and might be too far gone, LOL.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product to use for starting out, but should certainly be paired with a good sunscreen (I live in the desert and can *feel</li>
            <li> Also ordered a few others and hoping they are equally awesome because the price point is so much lower on this brand than most that I am currently using and not even really loving.</li>
            <li> I love this and find that my skin is much brighter since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, it has not been effective at all for me.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, product works okay</li>
            <li> It is much smoother to the touch and more</li>
            <li> I would say it was about 4-5 days before I noticed the difference, but my skin looks much fresher and more youthful.  </li>
            <li> Yes I really like this cream, but it will break out your skin, so be sure to apply medicated cream after this soaks into yours</li>
            <li> Although I am always being told I have a good complexion and people think I am younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> I would say that it is not bad for a moisturizer, but not a miracle worker, either.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be blessed with great skin: clear, creamy, poreless--the kind that&#x27;s always getting compliments and warnings from older ladies to take care of and protect it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say a mild cleanser with this product is a safe bet for anyone who wants to get rid of their acne.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is pretty strong</li>
            <li> I have seen the lines around my eyes diminish tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It may be good for 40 year old skin that shouldn&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li> I found a good natural night cream, but really missed the way the glycolic acid clarified my skin.</li>
            <li> I have mildly oily skin.</li>
            <li> no breakouts even for someone who is still super oily age 51.  </li>
            <li> I switched to a soap-free, mild cleanser, and since then - no acne and no dryness.  </li>
            <li> I have sun damaged and super wrinkles it seems to be doing something</li>
            <li> It tingles but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Thanks to other reviewers warning to avoid eye area, for I do feel it tightening under the eyes, and not in a good way!</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be, nicely package and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I applied since 5 days , great results,Pimple scars are almost gone ,pimples are dried out</li>
            <li> It does smooth my skin and very gradually reduce the size of keratoses on my face.</li>
            <li> It works very well with Reviva Labs Light Skin Peel.</li>
            <li> so far pleased</li>
            <li> I used cetaphil daily moisturizing cream (great for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I usually use Differing gel with great results but because it is a retinol, I cannot use it while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I use this along with several other products, but it has been a great addition!</li>
            <li> I still get the odd pimple or two -- most prominent when I run out of my cream and haven&#x27;t bought any more -- but it performs better than I ever expected!      </li>
            <li> This little jar of cream is amazing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced very little stinging sensation as opposed to what some others have reported.  </li>
            <li> but then i easily spot treat with peroxide and the rest of my skin is left smooth .</li>
            <li> With longer use--and good moisturizers--wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get use to the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, it really works it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I will have better feel of it after few more weeks of using.</li>
            <li> tried it once so far so can&#x27;t really tell yet if it&#x27;s gonna make my skin look any better</li>
            <li> I realize this is too soon to report on the effects the cream might have on my acne scars and fine lines, but I wanted to leave this review now because I have just had such an amazing and incomparable success with this product as a cystic and other acne treatment</li>
            <li> Very very liquid ..</li>
            <li> I can get away with skipping my tinted moisturizer and looking good with a little concealer and some blush.  </li>
            <li> Try this first before the 10%</li>
            <li> so they are not as purple but more white.</li>
            <li> I am 35 , using for the first time .</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the stuff burned/tingled.</li>
            <li> However the next morning my skin looked fabulous!.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more then moderate changes, I would refer you to the reviews of Rivva Labs with a higher Glycolic Acid level.</li>
            <li> Remember, it&#x27;s your face; the first vision people see, be cautious...</li>
            <li> I will be more faithful now &amp; use it daily.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> works very well-heard about glycolic acid on--dr oz!  </li>
            <li> Ultimately you have to know your skin and be able to gauge it&#x27;s tolerance.</li>
            <li> I did flake a bit at first, but nothing like when I started retin</li>
            <li> Now I just need to be better about using this stuff regularly.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product and most definitely this supplier to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial cream.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to pay more for a larger tub of the product.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time in my life that I use any acid on my skin.at</li>
            <li> I put it on for the first time and whiteheads that I&#x27;ve had for YEARS</li>
            <li> have used this product for a month now, I am running out of my first container.</li>
            <li> put this on as per the directions (\\&quot;for the first four weeks:</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice brighter,smoother skin first time you use it.</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk, my skin is free from scne and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I order it Monday night and got it same week Wednesday afternoon :)</li>
            <li> My skin peeled the first day while on this glycolic acid but to be frank any type of peeling</li>
            <li> It performs wonders for my skin and the 5% is not too harsh on my fair, freckled skin.</li>
            <li> Took it for granted that it&#x27;d look amazing forever, ignored the advice, and when I turned 30 all those years of sunbathing and partying/social-smoking in my early 20&#x27;s seemed to suddenly catch up with me.  </li>
            <li> keeps acne at bay, clears skin, reduces dark spots/acne scars AND makes skin look bright, tight and healthy.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and feels polished all the time now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the drier areas on my face, but it does manage to take care of the more oily and pimple prone areas.</li>
            <li> When it feels too dry, use some moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> Did research on glycolic acid and learned that it is strong stuff, so I opted for the 5% option and only use it according to directions in the evening...</li>
            <li> I used 5 days after pure glycolic acid peel 70%,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain it was the Reviva, maybe it was a change in diet?</li>
            <li> I have seen and felt pretty significant results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, i had very high hopes</li>
            <li> Warning: do not put over cuts because it really stings.</li>
            <li> Ordered on June 22 , I received on 25th , fast delivery by AllStarHealth.com  via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I havent really noticed a change in my acne</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I have seen not so much of a difference.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend to everyone skipping this one and going straight to 10% for faster results.</li>
            <li> It really has done the trick.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my over 55 skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think this would do much.</li>
            <li> and I think it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have very oil, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s really working all that well.</li>
            <li> I also use X Out by Proactive, but that alone didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> But i was really wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say I used this product nightly for a month straight and noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see too much difference from my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night/One month day-one month night/Works very well.</li>
            <li> And I have never had any remedy whatsoever, prescription, home, OTC, do anything much for my cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything much for my skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every night.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream, For Both Aging and Problem Skin, 1.5 Ounces (42 g)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> near mediocre at best is what i see</li>
            <li> I am excited about using the next one!</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients in this product, and it really makes a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to stop a red bump from turning into a full grown zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mail-order acne treatment solutions and pretty much everything they have to offer at grocery stores, and this is the first thing that has worked well for my skin without totally drying it out or breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I plan to order the 10% next and see if that does more; I will report back and if not, continue using the 5% until I am older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product I received was either a returned item, very old or is not the real deal/counterfit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of almost totally clear skin, over the last 6 months I have gotten some stubborn acne on parts of my face and this has cleared up significantly during the use of this cream.</li>
            <li> Working very well so far,  have not used the 10% yet as it has not been a month as the trial period recommends.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin greasy to where i dont even need a moisturizer, and i dont normally have greasy skin.</li>
            <li> Not alot now but enough for me to think that the price of this product is worth anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate a few times a week, too.</li>
            <li> I still use my normal night cream along with this.  </li>
            <li> After discovering this product, I don&#x27;t want to live without it and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> , this product and other reviews said it helped with fine lines, fading scars, and \\&quot;problem skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I did ALOT research to find that very few things are safe for pregnant women, glycolic acid being only one of the few that are SAFE.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is much more balanced and my breakouts have been less frequent.</li>
            <li> started using this a week ago right before applying the Porcelana and it has made a BIG difference.  </li>
            <li> every other or two day rest..exfoliate lightly to get max results...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little early for me to say for sure, but I have noticed some improvement.</li>
            <li> I would wake up with 4 new pimples BEFORE the glycolic acid (I&#x27;m a picker btw</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been one week and NOT one new pimple</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft from using this cream and it really helps with the soft lines around my eyes....</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Stings a little (surprisingly it feels no different to me than the same brand 10% cream) but does the job.</li>
            <li> Almost done with the first jar and definitely seeing the result.</li>
            <li> It has completely evened out my skin tone, smoothed my complexion and stopped any new pimples.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation with this, minimal peeling that is quickly dealt with by using an exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I have never written a single product review before, but I wanted to let all women out there know that this is product completely worth it and will change how you think about your skin.</li>
            <li> So glad I did, for I&#x27;m pretty tight faced using every other night with retin a.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend that step because you may need to figure out a proper exfoliation routine to make sure that you don&#x27;t get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t clear it up</li>
            <li> In the packaging it clearly states that the 10% is for those that have used the 5%.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had really congested pores from failing to wash my make up off nightly, and this made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> but there wasn&#x27;t any improvement on my 70 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I am young but I wanted this to help clear up my acne and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I tried a natural Retinol but am 62 years old, and it was way too drying.</li>
            <li> I get the occasional pimple and this product really helps.  </li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I leave on and enjoy the sizable tingle for a few minutes then add a layer of daytime moisturizer or at night Suki Nourishing Oil</li>
            <li> just ordered the 10% because I am completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients and observable benefits.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin so ,using this product was a leap of faith.</li>
            <li> This product has met my expectations so far.  </li>
            <li> I have not gotten any breakouts while using it and the old ones that were there before have shrunk considerably.</li>
            <li> This should be a cream and what I received was very soupy/runny and had no inner seal.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old woman.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> My acne comes and goes but at 28 years old you&#x27;d think this stage would be over.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sign that the old skin is coming off.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to do nothing for me as far as I could tell.  </li>
            <li> be forewarned, it does sting the first few times you use it, but it really works!</li>
            <li> virtually ALL of my cystic was GONE and my other acne was really cleared up!!</li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter, pores reduced significantly, and no more ruddiness (hope it prevents ruddiness in winter, when I almost look like I have rosacea!)</li>
            <li> first gets red and a little itchy,but in a few minutes the discomfort disappears and my skin looks very good and very firm.</li>
            <li> I have small moles; compliments of our lovely sun &amp; not using sunblock earlier in life.</li>
            <li> Kind of awkward at first, do use it once a week, then gradually work up to &amp;#34;Once</li>
            <li> but it actually started causing acne, even though i dont normally have it.</li>
            <li> Normally, I purchase from a local store but decided to order online.</li>
            <li> I have been using Reviva 5% glycolic for at least two months and it has given me the best clear skin,after having skin problems for decades and using expensive prescriptions and glycolic peels done by a derm.</li>
            <li> Really improves the appearance of my face in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I did find a pricey moisturizer at one point that simply did not cause more acne and was supposed to help with wrinkles, but I found it was not effective in the wrinkle dept.</li>
            <li> first couple weeks, I used it every other day.</li>
            <li> , I thought other customers might be interested.</li>
            <li> And I will say that the fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead are smoother for at least 24 hours after using cream.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to be helping the tiny bumps I have on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim and after a week of use cannot imagine this not being part of my essential natural beauty care regime.</li>
            <li> The lines on my face are not deep since I am in my early 30&#x27;s, but this made them nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I have always used herbal and natural products on my skin, such as shea butter and coconut oil and</li>
            <li> I only apply at night after washing with a bar of Dove or Olay for sensitive skin soap and I moisturize in the morning before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used other more expensive products; however, this works as well or better for less money.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> It stung a little when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Long story short, I got the 5 % once my skin came back to normal and</li>
            <li> I have been using other prescription acne products (retin-A and a topical antibiotic) for several years, but I am going through a very prolonged and stressful time in my life and they just stopped working at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, tends to be dry</li>
            <li> It does burn a little bit in certain areas but nothing unbearable at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if I use this product at least once a day, every day it works very very well!</li>
            <li> it helped cool down the slight burning instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Thick and rich cream, one jar lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> In my early 30s, and I am starting to be concerned with wrinkles and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> It appears that using this product with a natural dark spot treatment (Vitamin C or Kojic acid, etc.) helps to lift those sunspots.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product long enough to see a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed no difference in my skin other than new and harder to treat acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is worse because it looks OLD, wrinkles very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> MY skin did go a little crazy before it settled down, but once it did I was so happy.</li>
            <li> I think it is the perfect cream for those adults who do not have bad acne issues but still occasionally get those big monster zits that leave us all feeling like an insecure</li>
            <li> I recommend other facial creams from possibly olay, or neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> The next day it was like it burned my skin and left some dry rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> It has helped to clear up little bumps on my forehead and neck just under my ears.  </li>
            <li> Saw minor improvement.</li>
            <li> but it only last a few minutes following with moisturizer</li>
            <li> recently due to stress I have pimple problems around chin and cpl pimple scars left over .</li>
            <li> Even though I have regularly  used other products, I wanted to see how my skin responded to one.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and the bumps are long gone!  </li>
            <li> I used the product for 3 1/2 weeks...if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I also slather my face in Argan or Maracuja oil after using this since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Irritated the skin in my face it became dry and scaly and burnt-like.</li>
            <li> Used low percent retin a for over a year, had a few red face oopsies,</li>
            <li> I slowed down when my skin began to dry out and erupt with tiny pimples.</li>
            <li> All the reviews had me expecting a noticeable difference in my skin tone especially with my dark marks.</li>
            <li> I am not positive it is related, but extremely</li>
            <li> I only have half a jar of this stuff gone</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings slightly when applied, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have noticed a DEFINITE improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I personally do not get any stinging sensation like some of the other reviewers, but that is probably because I have used benzyl peroxide and all that other junk for close to 12 years.</li>
            <li> If it burns too much, or you notice that your skin is getting excessively tender, take a few days break.</li>
            <li> simply because with all the other products I have been using and some important public occasions coming up, I did not want to risk a bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very dry, if you dont use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> but now i get these tiny little bumps that leave a mark.</li>
            <li> I use this as a wrinkle preventative (I&#x27;m in my late 20s, but it&#x27;s never too early to start) and to prevent/reduce acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected to receive.  </li>
            <li> I use this morning, and night over a month, with no real results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never really gone away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life, some months are good and some are real bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for 10+ years and have tired every product for my sensitive moderate acne skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well on dry, dark skin on the knees, too.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at night and then apply a little moisturizer , and find I&#x27;m getting a similar result to my previous cosmetic cream.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You need very little and product does last awhile.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with my other face acne creams.</li>
            <li> a couple of months ago due to concerns about chemicals.</li>
            <li> Every Other Day.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of glycolic acid products and added them to my skin care a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month and the only thing I noticed was that the skin on my nose was peeling excessively</li>
            <li> I read all reviews  on this product and applies it on my skin based on other&#x27;s advice.</li>
            <li> I got a rash on my neck, but not in other areas.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been on it long enough to see any difference in shallow wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> Very irritating and frustrating, I don&#x27;t even feel comfortable going out in public.</li>
            <li> so i was very careful about using it,</li>
            <li> initially bought this product to reduce the dark marks on my face, and I&#x27;m not sure that I have noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> I have occasional acne breakouts, nothing to severe, but it leaves the worse hyperpigmentation marks on my face that last for months.</li>
            <li> I have been using a bleaching cream for some dark spots due to melasma for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint relates to the size.</li>
            <li> Makeup also goes on smoother with this product and it does reduce dark spots gradually.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed my blemishes and dark spots</li>
            <li> With my first baby, I had to suffer through horribly painful acne on my face but with my second pregnancy I refuse to suffer.</li>
            <li> I was having terrible break-outs and becoming neurotic about anti-aging skin care as my 30th birthday draws near.</li>
            <li> I do notice a little redness on my face during the day and I am considering using it every other Night to see if the redness will go away.  </li>
            <li> I mean not even a tiny one has shown up.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the small tub lasts a while.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review in a few weeks regarding other product uses.</li>
            <li> but so far, nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> You will feel a slight tingle, which, tells me it is doing what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother, softer and less oily.</li>
            <li> Seems that the wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use a moisturizer after applying it to reduce the slight burn.</li>
            <li> This does sting a little</li>
            <li> I use to have tons of little bumps, whiteheads I guess, all over</li>
            <li> /&gt;It never burned my face, but it did tingle my wife&#x27;s face a little.</li>
            <li> would reccomend this to anyone trying to lighten dark spots along with your fav bleaching cream!</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t use it every night, usually every other or every two nights, depending on what else I&#x27;m using on my skin.  </li>
            <li> this stings a little going on but in the morning my face feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I use a little at night with a herbal ( tumeric) moisturiser over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tingly, not quite a burning sensation but</li>
            <li> A little itchy until you put lotion on.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to diminish them little by little everyday.</li>
            <li> and it does burn a little when applied, but the feeling goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Just proceed very slowly, or you might be the next reviewer complaining about acid burn and/or crepy eyes.</li>
            <li> however benzoil peroxide is not good for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks and can see a difference in texture and glow.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of nothing i started slathering it on twice a day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times already.</li>
            <li> a. A spinning brush cleaner took care of the flakes after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also exfoliate everyday with st. Ives.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too harsh.</li>
            <li> It seems to be slightly firming  and helping with the small lines under my eyes and on forehead.</li>
            <li> Some very slight lightening could be seen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the 5% has caused me over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I got it, and after 2 days of using it my face dried out and got all of these small bumps on it.</li>
            <li> I am 47 and have a few small problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I had bad acne prior to using this product, and it has gotten rid of that and helped control any further outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> This cream stings a bit after initial application but nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had a small amount of stinging but used a moisturizer before or after and not problem.</li>
            <li> I have had acne on my forehead for the past year or so that won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of what results to expect.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of trying glycolic acid because my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve never used anything like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will move up to the 10%.</li>
            <li> (there were moments that I was not sure if I should continue.)You</li>
            <li> Have been searching years for a cream that targets both acne and wrinkles...very difficult to find a product like this that actually works for both issues.</li>
            <li> not sure yet time will tell.</li>
            <li> I used this product based on reviews that I read for small lines, acne scars and melasma.</li>
            <li> How well not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be helping some with the appearance of some small acne scars I have,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get another jar after this one is gone though, unless it starts performing wonders by then.  </li>
            <li> but over the past 8 months this has not happened.</li>
            <li> The 5% glycolic is just a little too weak.  </li>
            <li> There were times when my skin felt so dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I gave three stars for late delivery.</li>
            <li> the packaging sucks</li>
            <li> I now prefer at least 10%.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and increase use slowly.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it my face is slowly healing.</li>
            <li> I broke out with a bad rash over my entire face.</li>
            <li> Plus my insurance doesn&#x27;t coverage these products and they were getting expensive as well as pointless.</li>
            <li> if you have really bad dry skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> so the signs of aging are getting worse.</li>
            <li> My pore size has decreased.</li>
            <li> Alas that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> but im afraid of the greasy skin and breakouts</li>
            <li> For the past 7 months I&#x27;ve been suffering from real bad acne.</li>
            <li> It also cleared up bad acne</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting too badly</li>
            <li> Purchased this cream to add to my skin care regimen and have NOT been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Frustrated, I ordered this as a last-ditch effort, and I saw an immediate difference in 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> Worst cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smoking is the worst thing you can do for your skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product.  It stung a little when I first started using it but soon as you add a moisturizer on top it stops. This little jar of cream is amazing ! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 months. With my second jar I ordered a 10%glycolic peel that I use 1x a wk.  I have seen the lines around my eyes diminish tremendously.  They aren&#x27;t completely gone but the improvement is amazing.  Try this first before the 10%</li>
            <li> It helped a lot with blackheads I had around my chin!!! I feel my face brighter!!</li>
            <li> This does sting a little but I have sensitive skin. I just use at night before moisturizer seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks and have noticed that I have fewer breakouts on my chin. I also put it on when I&#x27;m noticing a pimple and it seems to stop a red bump from turning into a full grown zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this product to reduce the dark marks on my face, and I&#x27;m not sure that I have noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results in healing my acne, cleaning and shrinking of pores, and exfoliation.  I did use a 3.8% glycolic acid cream nightly a week before using this to lessen irritation,  and I had none. I&#x27;m 35 with combo, acne prone skin. I had really congested pores from failing to wash my make up off nightly, and this made a big difference.  I do need to use a moisturizer day and night because it has greatly reduced the oiliness in my face, but that&#x27;s a good thing! Will continue to use, then try the 10%. I put this cream on nightly, after washing with their foam face wash and toning with a salicylic toner from a different brand. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation with this, minimal peeling that is quickly dealt with by using an exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.... get through the intial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase and your skill will look amazing. After cystic acne and two courses of accurane, my looked good, but this is taking care of my remaining scars.  Be patient.  You have to give it a month or two before your skin really starts to look great!</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a month and it has done nothing for me.  It may be good for 40 year old skin that shouldn&#x27;t really need it but there wasn&#x27;t any improvement on my 70 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome strong stuff. This cream stings a bit after initial application but nothing too uncomfortable. It exfoliates quite well and that&#x27;s the purpose.  With that said, it does tend to  bring my acne to the surface but then i easily spot treat with peroxide and the rest of my skin is left smooth .</li>
            <li> I think it works well.  I use it in conjunction with my other face acne creams.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time. Just started using product..so far pleased</li>
            <li> Very very liquid .. sticky  did nothing. . I bought 2</li>
            <li> Stings but so far it seems to be helping the tiny bumps I have on my face. Not overly drying. Warning: do not put over cuts because it really stings.</li>
            <li> Worst cream I have ever used. I broke out with a bad rash over my entire face. I only used it twice. Very irritating and frustrating, I don&#x27;t even feel comfortable going out in public. I recommend other facial creams from possibly olay, or neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone out.</li>
            <li> I only have half a jar of this stuff gone and I already notice a difference. It says to use twice a day but I only use at night. I am young but I wanted this to help clear up my acne and whiteheads. It sure did! I use to have tons of little bumps, whiteheads I guess, all over but now I dont!! It also cleared up bad acne I had along my jawline and is fading the scarring from the acne. Also I have stretch marks on my belly from having a baby and it is helping fade them so they are not as purple but more white. I love this stuff! Its great to finally find something that works. Now I am ordering the 10% and I wanna see what is can do!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and blemish free.  I think it is the perfect cream for those adults who do not have bad acne issues but still occasionally get those big monster zits that leave us all feeling like an insecure teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never burned my face, but it did tingle my wife&#x27;s face a little.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be blessed with great skin: clear, creamy, poreless--the kind that&#x27;s always getting compliments and warnings from older ladies to take care of and protect it.  Took it for granted that it&#x27;d look amazing forever, ignored the advice, and when I turned 30 all those years of sunbathing and partying/social-smoking in my early 20&#x27;s seemed to suddenly catch up with me.  I&#x27;m 32 now and my skin just isn&#x27;t so amazing anymore.  Purchased this cream to add to my skin care regimen and have NOT been disappointed.  Sometimes it stings slightly when applied, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have noticed a DEFINITE improvement in my skin.  It honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much to help with pore reduction, but it&#x27;s caused a significant improvement in my complexion.  My skin feels 1000% smoother and softer and looks creamier and brighter now.  Pairing this with a retinol cream has all but erased the lines on the sides of my mouth and around my eyes and greatly softened those on my forehead.  I can get away with skipping my tinted moisturizer and looking good with a little concealer and some blush.  After discovering this product, I don&#x27;t want to live without it and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected to receive.  No issues.</li>
            <li> good product and shipping</li>
            <li> very good product at a very good price</li>
            <li> Ordered on June 22 , I received on 25th , fast delivery by AllStarHealth.com  via Amazon. I am 35 , using for the first time . My face never had a problem with acne , pimples ,scars etc . recently due to stress I have pimple problems around chin and cpl pimple scars left over . I applied since 5 days , great results,Pimple scars are almost gone ,pimples are dried out and my face is glowing . There was no stinging sensation at all , I even applied day and night . Recommend to everyone with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this and find that my skin is much brighter since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the 10% yet...that comes when I finish the 5%.&lt;br /&gt;Good value and great product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this glycolic acid cream!&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my glycolic acid containing night cream a couple of months ago due to concerns about chemicals. I found a good natural night cream, but really missed the way the glycolic acid clarified my skin. I tried a natural Retinol but am 62 years old, and it was way too drying. This product works great to almost do a mild peel, while keeping my skin moist. I apply it at night and then apply a little moisturizer , and find I&#x27;m getting a similar result to my previous cosmetic cream.</li>
            <li> I have mildly oily skin. I heard online that Glycolic Acid is good for acne, and I had to try it. I have a pimple here and there as well. At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the stuff burned/tingled. However the next morning my skin looked fabulous!. I havent really noticed a change in my acne (though I just get a pimple here and there). It can be a bit drying so  if you have really bad dry skin, this is not for you. But this stuff is wonderful (but burns)!</li>
            <li> I get the occasional pimple and this product really helps.  This cream makes my skin so soft.  A little goes a long way so the small tub lasts a while.  I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I used the product for 3 1/2 weeks...if you have dry skin my advice is &amp;#34;DON&#x27;T purchase this cream.  I tried to use it for four weeks to see if my skin improves.  My skin is worse because it looks OLD, wrinkles very noticeable.  I plan to visit a dermatologist for help to restore my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen not so much of a difference. I still keep getting a lot of acne daily. Has not reduce redish/dark spots . Being using it for month. Maybe i should go up to 10%</li>
            <li> Very good face cream but I would recommend to everyone skipping this one and going straight to 10% for faster results. Or use it twice a day from the beginning.</li>
            <li> This has been my must have facial care product for the last two years.  I use this as a wrinkle preventative (I&#x27;m in my late 20s, but it&#x27;s never too early to start) and to prevent/reduce acne breakouts.  I had bad acne prior to using this product, and it has gotten rid of that and helped control any further outbreaks.  I still get the odd pimple or two -- most prominent when I run out of my cream and haven&#x27;t bought any more -- but it performs better than I ever expected!      BTW I&#x27;d been buying at my local health store until today.  This is a MUCH better price than I could find in person!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I bought the product for blemishes and started using it the same day I received it, from that day I can honestly see my blemishes fading. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using a bleaching cream for some dark spots due to melasma for about a month now.  Some very slight lightening could be seen.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this a week ago right before applying the Porcelana and it has made a BIG difference.  It really has done the trick.  This was the missing step in the regimen to really lighten those spots.  It does burn a little bit in certain areas but nothing unbearable at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this to anyone trying to lighten dark spots along with your fav bleaching cream!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to clear/clean my skin from blotches and discoloration. I&#x27;m a woman of color and didn&#x27;t want to use something that was going to lighten my skin tone, just smooth it out. I have small moles; compliments of our lovely sun &amp; not using sunblock earlier in life. This product will make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so do use a good moisturize with sunblock/uv protection; the sun doesn&#x27;t discriminate. As far as the results it render; GOOD. Kind of awkward at first, do use it once a week, then gradually work up to &amp;#34;Once Every Other Day.&amp;#34; You will get some peeling, redness, and dryness, this is where the moisturizer come in handy. Overall if you only need moderate results, use it. If you&#x27;re looking for more then moderate changes, I would refer you to the reviews of Rivva Labs with a higher Glycolic Acid level. Remember, it&#x27;s your face; the first vision people see, be cautious...PS Yes it does sting; but nothing unbearable for me.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients in this product, and it really makes a positive difference in my skin.  I have sensitive skin, tends to be dry, so I don&#x27;t use it every night, usually every other or every two nights, depending on what else I&#x27;m using on my skin.  After only a week or so, my skin was looking younger (for 54!), seemed to have a brighter or fresher appearance.  With longer use--and good moisturizers--wrinkles are less noticeable.  For me, this product does sting a bit on some areas of my face; applying moisturizer according to the directions takes away the sting.  It appears that using this product with a natural dark spot treatment (Vitamin C or Kojic acid, etc.) helps to lift those sunspots.  I also use this product on the back of my hands, and saw improvement in the skin there as well.  It seems to work well on dry, dark skin on the knees, too.  Thick and rich cream, one jar lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have used other more expensive products; however, this works as well or better for less money. I have been using this cream for a few weeks and can see a difference in texture and glow. You will feel a slight tingle, which, tells me it is doing what it is supposed to do.  I followed the directions and increase use slowly. Even though I have regularly  used other products, I wanted to see how my skin responded to one. I have long been a fan of glycolic acid products and added them to my skin care a few years ago.  I will reorder this product! When I find a skin care product I like, I stick with it.</li>
            <li> I used to use another product They stopped making years ago in this strength. This does not irratate in anyway. I had a small amount of stinging but used a moisturizer before or after and not problem. Works really well on my over 55 skin. Thanks Amazon and it is a good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through a pharmacy website because i have been sent counterfeit lotions/cosmetics through amazon too many times. I wanted to like it, i had very high hopes but i do not feel a tingle or have any exfoliation effects. I have very sensitive skin so i was very careful about using it, but after a few weeks of nothing i started slathering it on twice a day. Still no exfoliation. It makes my skin greasy to where i dont even need a moisturizer, and i dont normally have greasy skin. I got it with the intent of exfoliating my nose and cheeks to eliminate blackheads but it actually started causing acne, even though i dont normally have it. I may try the 10% but im afraid of the greasy skin and breakouts the 5% has caused me over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> The product I received did not have a safety film under the lid.  So far, it has not been effective at all for me. I have noticed no difference in my skin other than new and harder to treat acne. I don&#x27;t get the tingling sensation that others have mentioned, my face just feels oily.</li>
            <li> I used 5 days after pure glycolic acid peel 70%, face appearing allergy skin, redness to be stopped. Best for removes scalps acne and old cell, no painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I another 40% lactic acid peel as soon as next view order.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Stings a little (surprisingly it feels no different to me than the same brand 10% cream) but does the job. If I stop using it my pores get grubby. I never get anything more than temporary irritation and my skin looks good, clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think this would do much. I am pleasantly surprised. I haven&#x27;t even used it everyday, but I have noticed my skin is much smoother even with sporadic use. I will be more faithful now &amp; use it daily. Haven had any burning, redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Great product for acne proned skin</li>
            <li> This product has been altered from the original formula. Nothing happens: no tingling-no sloughing. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim and after a week of use cannot imagine this not being part of my essential natural beauty care regime. I have seen and felt pretty significant results in a short period of time. My skin is super soft and feels polished all the time now. I have the glow back that seemed to be fading the last year (I&#x27;m 36).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process with this product is to use twice a day, morning then evening. I leave on and enjoy the sizable tingle for a few minutes then add a layer of daytime moisturizer or at night Suki Nourishing Oil (I think these two together may have a big effect on the results). After a lifetime of almost totally clear skin, over the last 6 months I have gotten some stubborn acne on parts of my face and this has cleared up significantly during the use of this cream. I am not positive it is related, but extremely likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the 10% because I am completely sold on this product. Also ordered a few others and hoping they are equally awesome because the price point is so much lower on this brand than most that I am currently using and not even really loving.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, product works okay</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will. Excellent choice. I would buy it again. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works very well-heard about glycolic acid on--dr oz!  I couldn,t find glycolic acid products in the regular stores except for one-AT FOUR TIMES THE PRICE1</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it is only one ingredient and I think it works really well. Very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I read up on the best wrinkle reducing cream and the glycolic acid was definitely what I found to be the best. I got it, and after 2 days of using it my face dried out and got all of these small bumps on it. So now I will never use this product again. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month and the only thing I noticed was that the skin on my nose was peeling excessively and my face was still breaking out. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it my face is slowly healing. I know people that have used this and had wonderful results. I guess it&#x27;s just not for my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished using this product, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks but it appears to be working okay.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 3 nights and I can already see a difference, softens and tightens skin and gets rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Really improves the appearance of my face in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> There is a woman at work who has beautiful skin (she is about 57 and I am 46). I asked her what skin care products she uses and one of the creams she uses is Reviva. So I tried it. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now and I have noticed a difference in my skin. It is much smoother to the touch and more even toned. I have had acne on my forehead for the past year or so that won&#x27;t go away. My Dr. prescribed a prescription acne cream that I used for 6 weeks and it didn&#x27;t clear it up so I stopped using it. Now that acne has cleared up after a month with Reviva. I can&#x27;t say for certain it was the Reviva, maybe it was a change in diet? Either way though, I am very pleased with the results so far. Definitely give it a try. However, I think its best as a night cream as the glycolic acid might not work well during the day if you are wearing sunscreen (I think it negates the benefits of sunscreen, you will have to look into this).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions and it did not bleach clothing. Saw minor improvement. Moving up to 10% next purchase.</li>
            <li> After using this cream 4-6 times a week for three weeks I have noticed a difference in the hyperpigmentation spots I have on the backs of my arms from clogged pores/acne. I also notice a smoother texture, so I felt safer in applying to my face. And I will say that the fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead are smoother for at least 24 hours after using cream. The lines on my face are not deep since I am in my early 30&#x27;s, but this made them nonexistent. I like the natural ingredients and observable benefits.</li>
            <li> this stings a little going on but in the morning my face feels like silk. i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and I love it.  I have very oil, acne prone skin and this has helped a lot.  I feel like my skin is much more balanced and my breakouts have been less frequent. I use this along with several other products, but it has been a great addition!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times already. I apply it under a facial cream before bedtime, then rinse it off in the morning. It takes a few times to get use to the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, it really works it leaves my skin feeling great. It was delivered on time, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better. This product is amazing. I have terribly sensitive skin so ,using this product was a leap of faith. I am so glad I decided to do it.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple weeks, I used it every other day. I slowed down when my skin began to dry out and erupt with tiny pimples. (It sucked, but I pushed through it) USE A STRONG MOISTURIZER! I used cetaphil daily moisturizing cream (great for sensitive skin) it helped cool down the slight burning instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Now i use the cream every night and it doesn&#x27;t burn. My skin is smooth and my complexion is evening out. :}&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin ,so to find a product that I can use every nigh is incredible. MY skin did go a little crazy before it settled down, but once it did I was so happy. I think this 5% glycolic cream is perfect for my skin. The 10% is a bit intimidating. Ultimately you have to know your skin and be able to gauge it&#x27;s tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s really working all that well.I&#x27;m not sure of what results to expect. near mediocre at best is what i see</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be, nicely package and easy to use. Shipped and arrived on time. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and so was concerned about buying the 10% version. With the 5% I can increase the frequency of my use rather than use a stronger product. It does smooth my skin and very gradually reduce the size of keratoses on my face. It tingles but is not unpleasant. I am on my second jar.</li>
            <li> This product has met my expectations so far.  I&#x27;m happy with how it has improved the appearance of blackheads in my t-zone areas.</li>
            <li> Working very well so far,  have not used the 10% yet as it has not been a month as the trial period recommends.</li>
            <li> I went to the doctor a couple of months ago about my acne, and the products that they prescribed me did nothing at all. Frustrated, I ordered this as a last-ditch effort, and I saw an immediate difference in 3-4 days! I also use X Out by Proactive, but that alone didn&#x27;t do much. I&#x27;d say a mild cleanser with this product is a safe bet for anyone who wants to get rid of their acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing &amp; fresh! I feel younger and I&#x27;m only 33</li>
            <li> Used low percent retin a for over a year, had a few red face oopsies, so figured I should start at the lower glycolic 5%. So glad I did, for I&#x27;m pretty tight faced using every other night with retin a. I don&#x27;t have to moisturize after retin a,  but do have to after glycolic 5%. Thanks to other reviewers warning to avoid eye area, for I do feel it tightening under the eyes, and not in a good way! So avoid the eye area by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, wow does my skin look good after about two weeks of alternating glycolic 5% with retin a. My skin is much brighter, pores reduced significantly, and no more ruddiness (hope it prevents ruddiness in winter, when I almost look like I have rosacea!) I did flake a bit at first, but nothing like when I started retin a. A spinning brush cleaner took care of the flakes after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just proceed very slowly, or you might be the next reviewer complaining about acid burn and/or crepy eyes. I haven&#x27;t been on it long enough to see any difference in shallow wrinkles yet. I&#x27;ll be 53 soon, and I do use a strong sunscreen already.</li>
            <li> Start extremely lightly...every other or two day rest..exfoliate lightly to get max results...no breakouts even for someone who is still super oily age 51.  Excellent value and results compared to other creams twice the price.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of trying glycolic acid because my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve never used anything like this. In my early 30s, and I am starting to be concerned with wrinkles and other skin issues. I did a lot of research before deciding to try this. I&#x27;m very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff does the trick. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the drier areas on my face, but it does manage to take care of the more oily and pimple prone areas. Coupled with the night and day creams my skin looks fabulous. Now I just need to be better about using this stuff regularly. Every time I do my skin glows and looks wonderful for days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave three stars for late delivery. I have used this product only for  a week.  I will have better feel of it after few more weeks of using.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first and they sounded good so I tried it. I&#x27;m 52 so the signs of aging are getting worse. I mostly wanted to try this product to reduce pore size. I read somewhere that a  cream couldn&#x27;t do that for you but I feel this product is working. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks and must say I&#x27;m hooked. My pore size has decreased. Not alot now but enough for me to think that the price of this product is worth anyone giving it a try. I&#x27;m not sure if I will move up to the 10%. I still get some stinging when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Move to the 10% it works but it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I am 47 and have a few small problem areas.  I immediately noticed a difference.  Shipping was fast.  Would recommend this product and most definitely this supplier to anyone.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. I started using it about a month ago, and I notice a big difference in my complexion. I started with the 5% based on a recommendation from another Amazon user. I definitely recommend that step because you may need to figure out a proper exfoliation routine to make sure that you don&#x27;t get dry and flaky. I am going to order the 10% and start with that after I finish this jar.</li>
            <li> I read really good reviews about this cream but to be honest, it has made my flawless skin kinda blotchy. I never had acne issues but now i get these tiny little bumps that leave a mark. And this cream is the only thing that changed in my skin care. It took my some time to figure out that this cream was the culprit, primarily because i was convinced that since it worked for everybody (well most of the people reviewing it), it&#x27;ll work for me. But i was really wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to add that using this does reduce the size of my pores. Hence 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mail-order acne treatment solutions and pretty much everything they have to offer at grocery stores, and this is the first thing that has worked well for my skin without totally drying it out or breaking the bank.  I switched to a soap-free, mild cleanser, and since then - no acne and no dryness.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a caramel coloured Caribbean woman. I have always used herbal and natural products on my skin, such as shea butter and coconut oil and those things work. I have found that with age and sun exposure etc by skin does not glow as it use , so I decided to try a light chemical exfolitant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for only one week and I truly love it. My skin is noticeably smoother, softer and less oily. Everything seems balanced. I use a little at night with a herbal ( tumeric) moisturiser over it. I have occasional acne breakouts, nothing to severe, but it leaves the worse hyperpigmentation marks on my face that last for months. This cream seems to diminish them little by little everyday. The new skin that it reveals is beautiful and truly the way we are suppose to look. I do not have wrinkles yet and I am hoping that this cream delays them even longer. I have not gotten any breakouts while using it and the old ones that were there before have shrunk considerably. I am excited to see what I would look like in a month or two. I apply a light oil of olay moisturiser with SPF in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience the burning or flaking that others have described but it could be the use of the tumeric over it. I am truly hoping that my skin doesn&#x27;t get use to it and then it just stops working. I am considering upgrading to the 10% when this container is finished but I am hesitant after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smoothing cream without any paraffins...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial cream. It&#x27;s fast, effective, and really light weight. My only complaint relates to the size. I would be willing to pay more for a larger tub of the product.</li>
            <li> This is the great exfoliation.  Gentle on sensitive face and neck.  Does not dry out the skin. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have to say I used this product nightly for a month straight and noticed no difference in my skin. All the reviews had me expecting a noticeable difference in my skin tone especially with my dark marks. Alas that didn&#x27;t happen. Perhaps I should&#x27;ve used the 10%, but this formula wasn&#x27;t the magic ticket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream for years and love it. It performs wonders for my skin and the 5% is not too harsh on my fair, freckled skin. Normally, I purchase from a local store but decided to order online. This should be a cream and what I received was very soupy/runny and had no inner seal. This product comes with an inner seal and has for years. The product I received was either a returned item, very old or is not the real deal/counterfit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t see too much difference from my skin. Might have to jump to 10%</li>
            <li> I started using it 2 months ago and my skin looks great.I have sensitive skin and this is the first time in my life that I use any acid on my skin.at first gets red and a little itchy,but in a few minutes the discomfort disappears and my skin looks very good and very firm.I am 36 years old woman.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know how it works but my skin has never ever ever ever been this good. I have struggled with pimples and breakouts since I was 13 and this product has trumped the hundreds of products I&#x27;ve tried- including products prescribed by my dermatologist. It has completely evened out my skin tone, smoothed my complexion and stopped any new pimples. I personally do not get any stinging sensation like some of the other reviewers, but that is probably because I have used benzyl peroxide and all that other junk for close to 12 years. I have never written a single product review before, but I wanted to let all women out there know that this is product completely worth it and will change how you think about your skin. Side note: the packaging sucks but I don&#x27;t even care, still AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with whiteheads forever and haven&#x27;t found anything that works except this stuff. I put it on for the first time and whiteheads that I&#x27;ve had for YEARS were gone the next morning. It&#x27;s a little tingly, not quite a burning sensation but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It works very well with Reviva Labs Light Skin Peel.I recomende it to all who has problems skin on the face.I use it day and night/One month day-one month night/Works very well.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin super smooth. I use it only as a night treatment and it works great under your moisturizer. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I broke out for over a month with no results so I tossed this product. I do not recommend this to anyone with problem skin</li>
            <li> I use this morning, and night over a month, with no real results. Leaves skin very dry, if you dont use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done anything that I can see for my skin. I just ordered the 10% instead. Hopefully that will show some noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because it tingles, feels great and It doesn&#x27;t break out my hyper-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase, it seems to have helped my brown spots...I would recommend it to all.  Wonderful delivery, on time, and packed very nicely.</li>
            <li> Started noticing the results immediately!  Doesn&#x27;t sting too badly</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...get my skin looking beautiful and healthy...excellent price.. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a beautiful glow..</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a daily basis for about 2 weeks and it has already brightened my complexion. It seems to be slightly firming  and helping with the small lines under my eyes and on forehead.</li>
            <li> ****Update&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a month now, I am running out of my first container. I have noticed contained acne control and significant reduction in my finest wrinkles. I think this is a good product to use for starting out, but should certainly be paired with a good sunscreen (I live in the desert and can *feel* that if I am out in the sun at all I will burn while using this without a sunscreen). I plan to order the 10% next and see if that does more; I will report back and if not, continue using the 5% until I am older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sort of felt like this was an impulse buy, but I am so glad I bought it! I have been using other prescription acne products (retin-A and a topical antibiotic) for several years, but I am going through a very prolonged and stressful time in my life and they just stopped working at all. Plus my insurance doesn&#x27;t coverage these products and they were getting expensive as well as pointless. I was having terrible break-outs and becoming neurotic about anti-aging skin care as my 30th birthday draws near. It was both pimples and alot of cystic acne (the deeper, swelling bump kind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product and other reviews said it helped with fine lines, fading scars, and \\&quot;problem skin.\\&quot; I figured what the h***, I have all three but have never tried glycolic acid, so why not. I chose the lower concentration simply because with all the other products I have been using and some important public occasions coming up, I did not want to risk a bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on as per the directions (\\&quot;for the first four weeks: apply at night and leave on for one minute, then add a night cream\\&quot;) and the NEXT MORNING virtually ALL of my cystic was GONE and my other acne was really cleared up!! I never IMAGINED such an instant response, I was hoping for something by the end of the month! And I have never had any remedy whatsoever, prescription, home, OTC, do anything much for my cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been approximatelya week now. I realize this is too soon to report on the effects the cream might have on my acne scars and fine lines, but I wanted to leave this review now because I have just had such an amazing and incomparable success with this product as a cystic and other acne treatment, I thought other customers might be interested. I will update this review in a few weeks regarding other product uses.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference! I would say it was about 4-5 days before I noticed the difference, but my skin looks much fresher and more youthful.  Big difference! Be sure to exfoliate a few times a week, too.</li>
            <li> A great product. Almost done with the first jar and definitely seeing the result. I have several people giving me a compliment on my skin.I just purchased 10% Glycolic Acid cream as it was advised by many people.  I read all reviews  on this product and applies it on my skin based on other&#x27;s advice. There were times when my skin felt so dry and uncomfortable. Then I  skipped a day and applied it the next day. When it feels too dry, use some moisturizer on top of it. My skin looks definitely much more moisturized  and shiny. I am so glad that I did not stop applying it.&lt;br /&gt; (there were moments that I was not sure if I should continue.)You might not see the result in a month and so, but do not get discouraged. I am confident that you will certainly see the result you desired. I just order three different product from this company. I am excited about using the next one!</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin tone has significantly evened out and I don&#x27;t have anymore breakouts. Words of advice: When using this product listen to your skin. If it burns too much, or you notice that your skin is getting excessively tender, take a few days break. I also slather my face in Argan or Maracuja oil after using this since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I would warn purchasers to use it gradually to determine whether your skin might react to it. I got a rash on my neck, but not in other areas.</li>
            <li> Have been searching years for a cream that targets both acne and wrinkles...very difficult to find a product like this that actually works for both issues. I did find a pricey moisturizer at one point that simply did not cause more acne and was supposed to help with wrinkles, but I found it was not effective in the wrinkle dept. This cream does it all....keeps acne at bay, clears skin, reduces dark spots/acne scars AND makes skin look bright, tight and healthy. Did research on glycolic acid and learned that it is strong stuff, so I opted for the 5% option and only use it according to directions in the evening...be forewarned, it does sting the first few times you use it, but it really works! Wish I knew about this product years ago....</li>
            <li> I have sun damaged and super wrinkles it seems to be doing something not sure yet time will tell. There is some tingling when you apply it but it only last a few minutes following with moisturizer its is good so far. Seems that the wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Reviva 5% glycolic for at least two months and it has given me the best clear skin,after having skin problems for decades and using expensive prescriptions and glycolic peels done by a derm. You&#x27;ll notice brighter,smoother skin first time you use it. I use it on acne and it gets rid of swelling and redness overnight. Wish I came across this product years ago. You need very little and product does last awhile. I use a moisturizer after applying it to reduce the slight burn. I also exfoliate everyday with st. Ives. Makeup also goes on smoother with this product and it does reduce dark spots gradually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little early for me to say for sure, but I have noticed some improvement. Excellent product with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working with no sting.. A little itchy until you put lotion on.</li>
            <li> I used this product based on reviews that I read for small lines, acne scars and melasma. I tryed it  for a month as directed with no improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Yes I really like this cream, but it will break out your skin, so be sure to apply medicated cream after this soaks into yours</li>
            <li> I think this product works.  How well not sure yet.  My skin is smoother and it seems to help with the lines.  I dont get a lot of sting anymore with it so I guess my skin is adopting to what is in the product.  Might try the 10% next time. I still use my normal night cream along with this.  They seem to be compatible enough as I dont have a problem using both.  I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor to treat Keratosis Pilaris--- if I use this product at least once a day, every day it works very very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night before bed and every morning (under makeup) for 3 weeks now.  I&#x27;ve experienced very little stinging sensation as opposed to what some others have reported.  It does seem to be helping some with the appearance of some small acne scars I have, but so far, nothing dramatic.  Perhaps with longer use.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get another jar after this one is gone though, unless it starts performing wonders by then.  I have some retinol cream that does about as well as this seems to be doing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product long enough to see a difference yet.  I have sensitive skin and it does &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when applied to my face. I do notice a little redness on my face during the day and I am considering using it every other Night to see if the redness will go away.  No change in pore size as yet, like I said before, I haven&#x27;t used it for more than two weeks yet.</li>
            <li> The 5% glycolic is just a little too weak.  I now prefer at least 10%.  It keeps my skin looking fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I love this cream. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and it has completely re-surfaced my skin for the better!! My pores have shrunk, my skin is free from scne and my skin is so soft. I love, love, love this cream.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft from using this cream and it really helps with the soft lines around my eyes....love it!!</li>
            <li> I order it Monday night and got it same week Wednesday afternoon :)&lt;br /&gt;Have tried it once so far so can&#x27;t really tell yet if it&#x27;s gonna make my skin look any better, I guess it will show over time!</li>
            <li> It was as described in advertisement.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Product is great, tingles a little, but says it would, Love it!</li>
            <li> Very Nice and Effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I&#x27;ve already noticed my blemishes and dark spots have drastically lightened or disappeared. Great product for brown skin and it&#x27;s not too harsh. I haven&#x27;t experienced any side effects as of yet.</li>
            <li> works well, not too strong</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid was talked about on a Dr. Oz show.  It has helped to clear up little bumps on my forehead and neck just under my ears.  I could never get rid of those pesky things with any product over the years.  I cleanse with cetaphil and use the glycolic acid once a day, then use moisturizer after that.  My skin feels smoother and the bumps are long gone!  My 25 year-old niece tried it for acne, but she felt a burning sensation.  I have heard that it could help reduce the appearance of age spots, but I am waiting to see whether that will happen to the one sun spot on my face.  Maybe I should try to use it on the age/sun spots on the back of my hands?</li>
            <li> Oh man! I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon I actually got this from ulta but I had to come on here and review this. For the past 7 months I&#x27;ve been suffering from real bad acne. My acne comes and goes but at 28 years old you&#x27;d think this stage would be over. Unmm heck no! I&#x27;ve gone to the dermatologist and he prescribed retin A with antibiotics that didn&#x27;t help. I was on those for 4 months. BLEH! Then I tried acne.org and it was okay however benzoil peroxide is not good for a long period of time. Anyway, since my acne comes and goes I&#x27;ve basically tried most of what&#x27;s out there with no permanent results. Side note: I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life, some months are good and some are real bad it&#x27;s never really gone away. I don&#x27;t know how I stumbled upon this but as soon as I seen the reviews I got out of my seat and drove to ulta. I have oily skin that is pretty strong or so I thought. I got the 10% oh no honey! The next day it was like it burned my skin and left some dry rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t come off. In the packaging it clearly states that the 10% is for those that have used the 5%. Long story short, I got the 5 % once my skin came back to normal and WOWZA! I would wake up with 4 new pimples BEFORE the glycolic acid (I&#x27;m a picker btw so I have a lot of hyper pigmentation)  it&#x27;s been one week and NOT one new pimple I mean not even a tiny one has shown up. I know it&#x27;s only been a week but over the past 8 months this has not happened. My skin peeled the first day while on this glycolic acid but to be frank any type of peeling I ENJOY it&#x27;s a sign that the old skin is coming off. I&#x27;m going to keep using the 5% until I run out then gradually increase to the 10%. If you have acne please try it. I hope this will help people because my skin has not felt like this in a LOOOONNGGGG time. I will update again in a couple of weeks. Yay Reviva !!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This cream did not work for me</li>
            <li> This seems like a good night time moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything much for my skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every night.  I have used it several times at this point.  I am also older (60) and might be too far gone, LOL. Although I am always being told I have a good complexion and people think I am younger than I am.  I have pretty sensitive skin and it does burn a little when applied, but the feeling goes away after a few minutes.  I would say that it is not bad for a moisturizer, but not a miracle worker, either.  The price is good, though.  I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on my skin since I don&#x27;t think it makes any difference.  The quality of one&#x27;s skin is mostly hereditary and as long as one uses a good moisturizer, eats a fairly healthy diet and gets some exercise, that is about all you can do.  And don&#x27;t smoke.  Smoking is the worst thing you can do for your skin.  And this won&#x27;t help that.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for 10+ years and have tired every product for my sensitive moderate acne skin. I usually use Differing gel with great results but because it is a retinol, I cannot use it while pregnant. With my first baby, I had to suffer through horribly painful acne on my face but with my second pregnancy I refuse to suffer. I did ALOT research to find that very few things are safe for pregnant women, glycolic acid being only one of the few that are SAFE. I gave this product a try and so glad I did! My skin has never been better! I only apply at night after washing with a bar of Dove or Olay for sensitive skin soap and I moisturize in the morning before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Irritated the skin in my face it became dry and scaly and burnt-like. I now just use it for my elbows and feet. It seems to work better for thicker skin.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to do nothing for me as far as I could tell.  It said the tingling effect shows that it is working, yet I never had this happen.  For me, this was a bust!</li>
