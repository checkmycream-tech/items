            <li>they look adorable!  </li>
            <li>These were amazing.</li>
            <li>it is a great way to get pretty nails without going to the salon and pay an arm and a leg for it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>Love the designs.</li>
            <li>however most of my coworkers said they looked fabulous on</li>
            <li>just ok  do not look as nice in person - might be good for a teen who likes bling</li>
            <li>I put them on easily.</li>
            <li>These are so pretty!!</li>
            <li>Anyway i find the wrap very easy to apply, it is made of a very pliable but durable vinyl wrap, that must be file off at the edges.</li>
            <li>These are a lot of fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy them again because they are fun and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>these were easy to apply and had such cute designs</li>
            <li>These would be a great buy for a young teen.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any sort of nail wrap</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sticker set that I&#x27;ve purchased in recent time.</li>
            <li>So i purchased these solely for the stellar horoscope pattern &amp;#60;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>So different and fun!</li>
            <li>I will order a new set, without a doubt.</li>
            <li>COMPLETE JUNK!</li>
            <li>After placing the wrap on my nails, I used the cuticle pusher to push it flat against my nails and down along the sides of the cuticle to make sure there were no air bubbles or space between the wrap and my nail.</li>
            <li>They peel and tear when you file them to the shape of your nail and unless you do a coat of clear before AND after, they WILL NOT stay.</li>
            <li>They were exactly as described and arrived within a few days of my order</li>
            <li>The adhesive is designed to peel away after washing in warm water, but if you apply a tacky base coat and a quick dry top coat they will last you at least a week if your not too rough on your nails.</li>

            <li> , I just cleaned the nails with nail polish remover, then washed and dried my hands before applying the nail wraps.  </li>
            <li> Lame.</li>

            <li> This is my first time using any sort of nail wrap so I can&#x27;t compare to any other brands. I put them on easily. After placing the wrap on my nails, I used the cuticle pusher to push it flat against my nails and down along the sides of the cuticle to make sure there were no air bubbles or space between the wrap and my nail. It&#x27;s only been two days so I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last. I&#x27;ll try to update when you come off to let you know how long they stay on. I did not paint my nails before or after, I just cleaned the nails with nail polish remover, then washed and dried my hands before applying the nail wraps.  Update: these stay good for about three days before the tips start to wear/ chip</li>
            <li> Started coming off after an hour.  Lame.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty!! This is my favorite sticker set that I&#x27;ve purchased in recent time. Im going to be sad when this runs out! I will order a new set, without a doubt. Good quality, and stick well for about a week.</li>
            <li> Very cute... I am looking forward to creating some interesting manicures!</li>
            <li> looks beautiful and easy to use</li>
            <li> they were perfect for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> They stay on well. In comparing to Jamberry&#x27;s, I&#x27;d say they hold their weight.</li>
            <li> So i purchased these solely for the stellar horoscope pattern &amp;#60;.&amp;#60;...Anyway i find the wrap very easy to apply, it is made of a very pliable but durable vinyl wrap, that must be file off at the edges. The adhesive is designed to peel away after washing in warm water, but if you apply a tacky base coat and a quick dry top coat they will last you at least a week if your not too rough on your nails. Needless to say i my first impression was most of the patterns were a little childish- for the tween set however most of my coworkers said they looked fabulous on so i give four stars instead of 3. These would be a great buy for a young teen.</li>
            <li> These were amazing. They stayed on for 3 weeks if not longer. I am a cna so I wash my hands alot and they stayed on through that. I would recommend them I will be getting more. They prevented me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Love these! So different and fun!</li>
            <li> these do not stay on the nails at all. I couldn&#x27;t get them to work for me</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun! Love the designs. it is a great way to get pretty nails without going to the salon and pay an arm and a leg for it. it can last about a week if i apply them well</li>
            <li> Little more expensive</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it, its perfect</li>
            <li> Excellent, super variety and they look adorable!  Wonderful value for the number and quality of nail wraps in the collection.  Please keep them coming!</li>
            <li> Not polish strips like some others, they are neat though and somewhat durable. I&#x27;d buy them again because they are fun and easy to apply. Last a few days through washing dishes and general house work.</li>
            <li> If I could give these less than 1 star, I would. COMPLETE JUNK! Beautiful designs, look great on the sheets. They peel and tear when you file them to the shape of your nail and unless you do a coat of clear before AND after, they WILL NOT stay. Don&#x27;t bother with these... Just buy Jamberry!</li>
            <li> These have stayed on my daughter&#x27;s nails for two weeks now.. these were easy to apply and had such cute designs</li>
            <li> Great item will be happy to purchase again.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my niece - she loved them!! They were exactly as described and arrived within a few days of my order</li>
            <li> just ok  do not look as nice in person - might be good for a teen who likes bling</li>
