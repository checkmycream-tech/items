            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>exactly what it says!!!!</li>
            <li>but when it became warm my hair frizzed up and curled.</li>
            <li>Nothing gets rid of frizz completely, but this stuff is the BEST!!!!!  </li>
            <li>The best oil i have ever used that for pressing that makes the hair soft</li>
            <li>Pressed hair will not revert and the hair has a very smooth, glassy type feel.</li>
            <li>For me it works better than Lok Blok</li>
            <li>The Sabino website suggests leaving in conditioner after shampooing and then applying the Sabino on top.</li>
            <li>I love the shine and the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>It also keeps it healthy by protecting it from the heated treatments I use as well.</li>
            <li>This product with heat makes your  hair healthy looking and shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased it from Amazon because I wanted to make sure that my purchase would be secure</li>
            <li>I know that it has been updated to &#x27;loc n block&#x27; but was happy to have this old version.</li>
            <li>This is the best hidden hair product</li>
            <li>shipped quickly and price ok.</li>
            <li>Then I lightly blot my hair --hair should remain damp though.</li>
            <li>This product works great when my stylist uses this in addition to hair wax to flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the best process for me has been to simply wash and condition my hair as normal</li>
            <li>I am giving this product 5 stars just for the super speedy shipping.</li>
            <li>Good alternative when the real stuff is on back order.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the original from another website a few years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I recieved the product and right away I used it.</li>
            <li>However, I read a lot of reviews on Lok n Block and a lot of people were stating that while it was a decent product, it did not compare to the original.</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;&#x27;t do without it during the hot humid summer weather.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional!</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as the directions stated and it worked.</li>
            <li>Anyway, recently I decided to go searching for a second bottle, this stuff is that good.</li>
            <li>The first time I used a lot of this product because I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li>you ever used the real MB</li>
            <li>is keeping my roots straight</li>
            <li>Too much, and then your hair is greasy, but it tells you that...</li>
            <li>I have straight hair somwhen</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s now growing and very shiny</li>
            <li>This product allows me to wear my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I do not use as much.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely blocks the moisture so that my hair DOES NOT frizz until I wash it.  </li>
            <li>ITS IMPORTANT YOU DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH OF THIS, BUT OTHERWISE IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR REAL.</li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I decided to take a risk on this seller when I found MB on Amazon and will be posting another review to give my opinion on whether or not it is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, I have natural African American hair</li>
            <li>Only for me to find out that was not the original Sabino Moisture Block.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used for frizzy unruly hair, I won&#x27;t &#x27;use anything else.</li>
            <li>The original Sabino Moisture Block was discontinued and it was replaced by Lok n Block to serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine 3b &amp; 4b hair that frizzes with just one drop of moisture in the air.  </li>
            <li>worked on my hair when it was cool outside</li>
            <li>I can honestly say every frizz remedy I&#x27;ve tried over the past 35 years has not worked like Moisture Block.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY UN-RULEY HAIR AND LIVE IN FLORIDA, UNFORTUNTLY,</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for Sabino.</li>
            <li>The results look pretty much the same a week or more later as it did the first day I flat iron (I know it can last much longer</li>
            <li>(I live in Portland, OR where it rains often any time of the year that isn&#x27;t summer).&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this product does pretty well, the only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do well in</li>
            <li>The most disappointing thing of all is the fact that a reputable site Amazon would continue to sell something that is clearly not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Apparently they&#x27;re having issues with companies counterfeiting this particular product.</li>
            <li>It contains only two ingredients (silicones): cyclomethicone and dimethicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used the Moisture Block to blowdry my hair last night and it is indeed the real stuff!!</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who is wearing their natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural (no relaxer) 4b-4c shoulder length</li>
            <li>Thank Goodness Sabino actually takes the fakes and replaces it with the real thing.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of this product in my wet hair before blow-drying and my hair is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found to really combate my frizzle hair.</li>
            <li>I have had it for several weeks &amp; have tried different amounts trying to get it right.</li>
            <li>So when I came across this I was excited, little did I know that 1.</li>
            <li>(you must wash your hair well to actually get the old residue of the product off!</li>
            <li>No other product has given me results like this.</li>
            <li>I can say that the product left my hair shiny, non heavy, and it did not revert back easily with exercising.  </li>
            <li>then this may take some getting used to (its heavier, so less is more or less your hair will be greasy and stringy).</li>
            <li>I have never found a product that works well, but this is worse than most.</li>
            <li>I made sure when purchasing this product on the Amazon.com website that it was the original product, but when it arrived to day it was not :(</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman who is going natural.  </li>
            <li>I frequently wear my hair flat-ironed and by using this product (especially with the humidity here in Houston), I can get my hair to last the entire week, and this includes me working out.  </li>
            <li>But more and more buyers are complaining about discovering the hard-to-find original on various websites only to be disappointed by the discovery that it was a fake formula.</li>
            <li>I really got so little actual product that I could use since it had spilled everywhere!</li>

            <li> I really got so little actual product that I could use since it had spilled everywhere!</li>
            <li> original Moisture Block has no scent, it&#x27;s very thick and transparent.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised because all of the other so-called anti humidity products I used did nothing for my hair....</li>
            <li> Then flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use when i flat iron my 4b hair.  </li>
            <li> I also drizzle a little on my brush and brush it through my dry hair on those &amp;#34;humid&amp;#34; days, but it is true, a LITTLE goes a LONG way..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to keep straight.</li>
            <li> As long as I can buy it, I&#x27;ll be doing so..</li>
            <li> * Keeps my hair from reverting and frizzing up for over a week (as long as I don&#x27;t immerse it in water).</li>
            <li> I also use this when i blow dry my hair for a heat protectant.  </li>
            <li> product did no harm but also did not help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> Product did not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> Whereas other products don&#x27;t even keep my hair from reverting minutes after I&#x27;ve finished flat ironing.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was already open and spilled all over some of my paper work and other stuff I had with me!</li>
            <li> Have coarse, thick wavy hair which frizzes easily especially by the ocean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve finally found a product to tame my unruly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Or your hair will turn into a dry, sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I found a small amount in my travel bag and used it recently and knew I had to go on a hunt for it.</li>
            <li> It did just what I needed it to do and has lived up to the other reviews i have read about.  </li>
            <li> I can add a little more if the weather&#x27;s really bad.</li>
            <li> it comes to fixing my little girls curls, it has been a , learning process.</li>
            <li> If I use too little it doesn&#x27;t work as well as if I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely expensive considering it really is hard to gauge how much product is needed.</li>
            <li> this go &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> My hair is either heavy, dull, tacky, or worse of all, frizzy.</li>
            <li> (I have thick, curly hair).</li>
            <li> I thought the product was to thick and sticky....</li>
            <li> I am white and have the worst frizz hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a fake product.</li>
            <li> And I ended up buying one, the words were wrong on the packaging and the bottle was shaped wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair tends toward coarse and frizzy and is terribly affected by humidity.</li>
            <li> Fake</li>
            <li> Totally shocked!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It might be the knockoff of MB but it works the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever used the real MB then this may take some getting used to (its heavier, so less is more or less your hair will be greasy and stringy). Good alternative when the real stuff is on back order. For me it works better than Lok Blok (I have thick, curly hair).</li>
            <li> Please go to www.sabinohair.com what the correct product is suppose to look like.  I made sure when purchasing this product on the Amazon.com website that it was the original product, but when it arrived to day it was not :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I have natural African American hair so it&#x27;s hard to keep straight. But this product does pretty well, the only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do well in is keeping my roots straight, I have yet to find a product to do that, except a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I frequently wear my hair flat-ironed and by using this product (especially with the humidity here in Houston), I can get my hair to last the entire week, and this includes me working out.  Great product.  I recommend to anyone who is wearing their natural hair.  I have multi-texture 3c and 4a.</li>
            <li> I am white and have the worst frizz hair.  I also drizzle a little on my brush and brush it through my dry hair on those &amp;#34;humid&amp;#34; days, but it is true, a LITTLE goes a LONG way.. Too much, and then your hair is greasy, but it tells you that... Nothing gets rid of frizz completely, but this stuff is the BEST!!!!!  As long as I can buy it, I&#x27;ll be doing so.. Bought 2 this go &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair somwhen it comes to fixing my little girls curls, it has been a , learning process. A friend of mine recommended this stuff so I tried it and I was amazed at how wonderful it keeps her hair looking. Frizz free!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hidden hair product&lt;br /&gt;on earth!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of products and use to perm&lt;br /&gt;my hair as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore this has taken my hair to new&lt;br /&gt;lenghts as it&#x27;s now growing and very shiny&lt;br /&gt;and healthy too!!!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what it says!!!!</li>
            <li> Have coarse, thick wavy hair which frizzes easily especially by the ocean. This product allows me to wear my hair straight and shiny. Also defines and smooths my curly styles. I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> My short frizzy hair is controlled and shiny. Can&#x27;&#x27;t do without it during the hot humid summer weather. Hair always stays the same through out the day</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would moisturixe my hair after washing and styling. Well I researched and came upon this Sabino Moisture Block. I went to the site and it was out . I then came to AMAZON. I purchased it from Amazon because I wanted to make sure that my purchase would be secure and well I trusted the site. I recieved the product and right away I used it. Well I was dissappointed at the results. Well I thought that I used it incorrectly. Only for me to find out that was not the original Sabino Moisture Block. The most disappointing thing of all is the fact that a reputable site Amazon would continue to sell something that is clearly not the real thing. But it is a lesson learned. I will never buy anything from this site again.</li>
            <li> I thought the product was to thick and sticky....also did not work, hair frizzed  up in about one hour. Will look for something else.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for Sabino. I have had it for several weeks &amp; have tried different amounts trying to get it right. My hair is either heavy, dull, tacky, or worse of all, frizzy. I went walking outside yesterday and when I was done, my hair was frizzer than ever. I have never found a product that works well, but this is worse than most. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> The best oil i have ever used that for pressing that makes the hair soft</li>
            <li> The beauty supplies in my area no longer carry this, for a couple of years now. I found a small amount in my travel bag and used it recently and knew I had to go on a hunt for it. I know that it has been updated to &#x27;loc n block&#x27; but was happy to have this old version. I have never had a blow out, but the way that it is described I think this product may deliver some of the same benefits!! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have natural (no relaxer) 4b-4c shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;* Keeps my hair from reverting and frizzing up for over a week (as long as I don&#x27;t immerse it in water). Whereas other products don&#x27;t even keep my hair from reverting minutes after I&#x27;ve finished flat ironing. (I live in Portland, OR where it rains often any time of the year that isn&#x27;t summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s definitely expensive considering it really is hard to gauge how much product is needed. If I use too little it doesn&#x27;t work as well as if I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Process:&lt;br /&gt;* The Sabino website suggests leaving in conditioner after shampooing and then applying the Sabino on top. This is supposed to makeup for the fact the Sabino Moisture Block is actually not moisturizing --it literally is just a really good sealer/sealant preventing moisture from getting to the hair. However, the best process for me has been to simply wash and condition my hair as normal (you must wash your hair well to actually get the old residue of the product off! Or your hair will turn into a dry, sticky mess. No co-washing.). Then I lightly blot my hair --hair should remain damp though. Then I use my Denman brush to run the Sabino Moisture Block through medium sized sections of my hair. I brush in enough product until the section is no longer damp. I use about a quarter size amount on each section. Continue process on entire head. Then flat iron. The results look pretty much the same a week or more later as it did the first day I flat iron (I know it can last much longer but I like to wash my hair every week). No other product has given me results like this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used for frizzy unruly hair, I won&#x27;t &#x27;use anything else. shipped quickly and price ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisture Block for years, and a while ago Sabino discontinued this and replaced it with similar product but it just wasn&#x27;t the same. So when I came across this I was excited, little did I know that 1. Sabino re-introduced Moisture Block and 2. I purchased a fake product. Apparently they&#x27;re having issues with companies counterfeiting this particular product. And I ended up buying one, the words were wrong on the packaging and the bottle was shaped wrong. Thank Goodness Sabino actually takes the fakes and replaces it with the real thing. Now that I know that they sell it again, I&#x27;ll only be purchasing from their official site.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use when i flat iron my 4b hair.  I can say that the product left my hair shiny, non heavy, and it did not revert back easily with exercising.  It did just what I needed it to do and has lived up to the other reviews i have read about.  I would repurchase this again.  A little goes a long way.  I also use this when i blow dry my hair for a heat protectant.  It is Awesome..</li>
            <li> Thank you!!! Received this product exactly on time, and I love it!!!! Shipped out the same day I ordered!!!! A+++++</li>
            <li> worked on my hair when it was cool outside but when it became warm my hair frizzed up and curled.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was already open and spilled all over some of my paper work and other stuff I had with me! It ruined some of my things! I really got so little actual product that I could use since it had spilled everywhere! I will not shop with this company again! Very unprofessional!</li>
            <li> My hair tends toward coarse and frizzy and is terribly affected by humidity. Just a tiny bit of this product in my wet hair before blow-drying and my hair is smooth and soft. I can add a little more if the weather&#x27;s really bad. I love the shine and the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found to really combate my frizzle hair. It also keeps it healthy by protecting it from the heated treatments I use as well.</li>
            <li> OMG, 35 years and I&#x27;ve finally found a product to tame my unruly frizzy hair.  I can honestly say every frizz remedy I&#x27;ve tried over the past 35 years has not worked like Moisture Block.  My hair would start to frizz two days before the rain would arrive!  Follow the suggested instructions and you can&#x27;t miss.  I apply a dollop over my conditioner in the shower and then rinse out and another dollop after I leave the shower before styling.  The first time I used a lot of this product because I really wanted it to work.  Now that I know IT WORKS I do not use as much.  I cannot believe my hair doesn&#x27;t revert back in the rain.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who is going natural.  I don&#x27;t know the texture of my hair besides coarse.  This product works great when my stylist uses this in addition to hair wax to flat iron my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t go poof!!!!</li>
            <li> It did not work when I used it on my hair.  My hair was still frizzy  in humid weather. Fake</li>
            <li> AMAZING! This is the only product that has ever worked to keep my hair from frizzing!!!  I will continue to use it and hope the never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Simplified my life.  I have long, fine 3b &amp; 4b hair that frizzes with just one drop of moisture in the air.  This absolutely blocks the moisture so that my hair DOES NOT frizz until I wash it.  Use Moisture Block in the summer because it&#x27;s a thicker formula and Lok &amp; Blok in the winter, thinner formula (same company).  Only need a dime size for the entire head.  For me, one bottle lasts a year.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have chemically damaged hair that I still like to style.  This product with heat makes your  hair healthy looking and shiny.I apply to each piece before flatironing or curling. Perfect! Now I don&#x27;t heat style without it.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST AND PRICE WAS GOOD..ITS IMPORTANT YOU DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH OF THIS, BUT OTHERWISE IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR REAL. I HAVE VERY UN-RULEY HAIR AND LIVE IN FLORIDA, UNFORTUNTLY, SO IT DOES HELP FOR THE HUMIDITY. THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Product did not live up to expectations. product did no harm but also did not help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars just for the super speedy shipping. I placed my order on a Saturday evening and received it Monday morning. Totally shocked! The original Sabino Moisture Block was discontinued and it was replaced by Lok n Block to serve the same purpose. However, I read a lot of reviews on Lok n Block and a lot of people were stating that while it was a decent product, it did not compare to the original. So I ordered the original from another website a few years ago and loved it. I think it might have been $18 with shipping?? Anyway, recently I decided to go searching for a second bottle, this stuff is that good. But more and more buyers are complaining about discovering the hard-to-find original on various websites only to be disappointed by the discovery that it was a fake formula. I decided to take a risk on this seller when I found MB on Amazon and will be posting another review to give my opinion on whether or not it is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Moisture Block has no scent, it&#x27;s very thick and transparent. When used properly it seals out all moisture. Pressed hair will not revert and the hair has a very smooth, glassy type feel. It contains only two ingredients (silicones): cyclomethicone and dimethicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used the Moisture Block to blowdry my hair last night and it is indeed the real stuff!! Oh how I&#x27;ve missed you, Sabino!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used it exactly as the directions stated and it worked. I was pleasantly surprised because all of the other so-called anti humidity products I used did nothing for my hair....Sabino works! Please, please do not discontinue this product.</li>
