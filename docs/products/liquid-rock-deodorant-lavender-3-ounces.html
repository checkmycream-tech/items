            <li>This roll on is very effective and no rash!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many this def works the best!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pleasant but not over powering scent.</li>
            <li>This deodorant I found to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>do reaply during the day, but better then putting chemicals into my body!</li>
            <li>My Face makes nice products .</li>
            <li>The roll is kind of liberal, and may let out a bit of excess product.</li>
            <li>It is much more effective than the stick.  </li>
            <li>Excellent natural alternative.</li>
            <li>Smells great and stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>This works great, and you don&#x27;t get aluminum absorbed into your skin, which I&#x27;ve heard from many places</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li>This product has been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay because it isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li>Great all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Aluminum free and healthy deoderant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it while working out but for everyday use it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>tried this product because I was looking for something more effective than the regular alum crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh but not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It controls smell and keeps me feeling fresh all day even when I sweat.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>It never goes away even after many washes in various temps etc.  </li>
            <li>For me, it does not work all  day long, and it does not smell anything like lavender, but it does have an OK smell.</li>
            <li>Applying it feels like large salt crystals, not a gooey ooze.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because I refuse to use an antiperspirant</li>
            <li>(we need to perspire) and this deodorant works very well</li>
            <li>My wife bought this, but she really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It was usually always beaten out by the &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; deodorants but seeing that it was more natural and Aluminium free I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would find a deodorant with such a true smell of lavender.  </li>
            <li>Decent deodorant if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day long and keeps you fresh!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I feel so free with finding this, no more making sure my arms are closed around people</li>
            <li>I do enjoy using it because it doesn&#x27;t cause the problems that other under arm deodorants do.</li>
            <li>The new bottles are too drippy</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that works as advertised, by a company I believe in, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s natural, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Out of all the natural deoderants I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>and I must use an all natural deodorant under my arms.</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand because it has no artificial colors or fragrances, no animal ingredients or unnecessary chemicals and is Paraben free.  </li>
            <li>I would say that, for me, the regular crystal is at least twice as effective as this product.</li>
            <li>Not wanting aluminum in my deodorant, it can be difficult to find one that also provides good protection.</li>
            <li>I got really sensitive to the rock after several years of use.</li>
            <li>This has held up A MILLION times better than Secret Clinical.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product&#x27;s efficacy, but based on other reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> My armpits smell really bad and still sweat a lot even though I apply it several times a day.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about two weeks, but each day, 2 to 3 hours after applying, my underarms would start to smell just as badly as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any deodorant at all, and I wasn&#x27;t physically exerting myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sadly it ruined my cotton shirts with a permanent pit stain that won&#x27;t come out.  </li>

            <li> I have been using all the major brands of clinical strength deodorants/antiperspirants (Secret, Dove, etc) since 2007, and prior to that Mitchum Dri and even tried some men&#x27;s deodorants they seemed to help but never fully got rid of the odor for me. By mid day I would be smelling quite ripe and even reapplying didn&#x27;t help. I finally started Googling &amp;#34;Top Rated Deodorants&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Best performing deodorants&amp;#34; and saw Kiss My Face Liquid Rock on several lists. It was usually always beaten out by the &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; deodorants but seeing that it was more natural and Aluminium free I decided to try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did!! This has held up A MILLION times better than Secret Clinical. I do reapply a couple times a day just as I get a slight hint of odor, and it actually goes back to performing again, unlike the Clinicals I used. And big Plus - Is an invisible. None of the clinicals I found were - they always left a white mess. I feel so free with finding this, no more making sure my arms are closed around people so I don&#x27;t open the door of stink, and I can wear dark colored tank tops, sleeveless dresses and swimsuits again without the white chalky mess. So Happy!!</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that works as advertised, by a company I believe in, at a reasonable price. I was skeptical about the product&#x27;s efficacy, but based on other reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Not wanting aluminum in my deodorant, it can be difficult to find one that also provides good protection. Liquid Rock does the job and it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li> Works great! I haven&#x27;t tried it while working out but for everyday use it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will use. It works and no aluminum. I highly recommend it. Well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great all natural deodorant. Works pretty well although I&#x27;ll occasionally get stinky in which case I reapply.</li>
            <li> The lavender liquid rock deodorant works well.  It is much more effective than the stick.  I prefer this brand because it has no artificial colors or fragrances, no animal ingredients or unnecessary chemicals and is Paraben free.  It means a lot that Kiss My Face respects our health.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It worked in the winter when I wasn&#x27;t actually sweating from the heat.  Once the weather warmed up, it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Sadly it ruined my cotton shirts with a permanent pit stain that won&#x27;t come out.  I&#x27;ve tried scrubbing them with detergent, oxygen bleach and no luck.  Whatever is in this deodorant has made this crusty dark coating on the fabric. It never goes away even after many washes in various temps etc.  Not cool.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because I refuse to use an antiperspirant (we need to perspire) and this deodorant works very well and I especially like it&#x27;s pleasant but not over powering scent. Kiss My Face makes nice products .</li>
            <li> After a while, I get an underarm rash from o-t-c deodorants, so someone recommended Liquid Rock.  It&#x27;s great. Applying it feels like large salt crystals, not a gooey ooze. And no rash for months and months. I like the Lavendar and Patchoulie scents.  And it lasts a while, too.</li>
            <li> This deodorant did NOT work for me. After reading all the reviews and seeing how others said it worked for them, I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it does NOT stop me from sweating or from smelling. My armpits smell really bad and still sweat a lot even though I apply it several times a day. Yes, it&#x27;s natural, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Not the best deodorant during this summer heat.</li>
            <li> The new bottles are too drippy</li>
            <li> Excellent natural alternative. Lasts all day long and keeps you fresh!</li>
            <li> Out of all the natural deoderants I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many this def works the best!</li>
            <li> Unlike other all natural deodorants this one did not irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t help the odor once I perspired (even a little sweat).</li>
            <li> Aluminum free and healthy deoderant. Smells fresh but not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;I do reaply during the day, but better then putting chemicals into my body!</li>
            <li> Smells great and stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This product has been a favorite of mine. I do enjoy using it because it doesn&#x27;t cause the problems that other under arm deodorants do. My mom had liphatic cancer and I must use an all natural deodorant under my arms. It controls smell and keeps me feeling fresh all day even when I sweat.</li>
            <li> This works great, and you don&#x27;t get aluminum absorbed into your skin, which I&#x27;ve heard from many places may cause Alzheimer&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, but she really didn&#x27;t like it. She didn&#x27;t think it worked well and didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like lavender</li>
            <li> I used the Avalon lavender deodorant for years then they quit making it!  This one just doesn&#x27;t cut it with it&#x27;s half hearted scent.</li>
            <li> Like this deodorant, no aluminum yet it keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Decent deodorant if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot. You also have to shower before putting it on or else it doesn&#x27;t work. The smell is okay because it isn&#x27;t overbearing. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got really sensitive to the rock after several years of use. This roll on is very effective and no rash! The rock was causing something that required cortisone cream for relief which I don&#x27;t like doing at all.</li>
            <li> Simply did not work for me as a deodorant. I tried this product for about two weeks, but each day, 2 to 3 hours after applying, my underarms would start to smell just as badly as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any deodorant at all, and I wasn&#x27;t physically exerting myself.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product because I was looking for something more effective than the regular alum crystal deodorant. I would say that, for me, the regular crystal is at least twice as effective as this product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant I found to work fairly well. For me, it does not work all  day long, and it does not smell anything like lavender, but it does have an OK smell. The roll is kind of liberal, and may let out a bit of excess product.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would find a deodorant with such a true smell of lavender.  A little goes a long way.  Kiss My Face always has quality products.</li>
