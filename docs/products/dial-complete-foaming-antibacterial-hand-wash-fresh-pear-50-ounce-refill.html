            <li>and the price was good</li>
            <li>Good soap and smells good</li>
            <li>Item does not have a good seal on the cap.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a fairly good product that I would buy again, but at the lower cost.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, but it is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This product was packaged great in case of leakage and well worth the value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the soap and am so glad to find the refill.</li>
            <li>Love this foaming hand soap</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a refill of the smaller pump dispensers that I purchased from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Well, that was all, but amazon required 4 more words.</li>
            <li>It does suds up but nothing more.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t go over the maximum fill mark</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It rinsesoff better then oter bottle liquid soap</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this foam soap.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more refills .</li>
            <li>This smells nice and gets my hands clean.  </li>
            <li>It produces a foam hand wash that is a light pear scent and lovely.  </li>
            <li>What can you say about soap, it smells good and works very well</li>
            <li>Pleased to have it, makes washing hands more fun for everyone.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Usually I would buy the Lavender SoftSoap and that one is awesome but this time I decided to go cheap and search around for more soap for my dollar.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t purchase this size locally, I was happy to discover it was available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am having the same problems as one of the customer has experienced.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent and avoids the use of bars of soap that can get rather messy at times.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good easy to use product that requires no maintenance or cleaning of soap dishes.</li>
            <li>We were originally using the foaming soap refill from Target when we got feed up of the soap coming out watery and not foaming.</li>
            <li>although we no longer have children at home, the foaming hand wash might make it easier to encourage youngsters to keep their hands clean.</li>
            <li>see on the front label that it should be used with the Dial special pump.</li>
            <li>Hard to find foaming liquid soap, especially at a great price.</li>
            <li>The large refill bottle is very convenient and cost effective but seldom can find it in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Came quickly......</li>
            <li>I would not be writing this if you had not forced my hand by your too many email requests</li>
            <li>It is a better alternative to buying a new soap dispenser with soap each time it runs out.</li>
            <li>This is much lighter and works fine.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product - the foaming quality makes it easy to control the quantity used and the scent is clean and pure.</li>
            <li>The Dial soap is the complete opposite as it foams up great and is not watery like the Target brand.</li>
            <li>Economical.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Hoping this was a one time problem, I&#x27;ll update the next time I order more.</li>
            <li>It was clear that this bottle was filled with water with probably 10% of it being soap.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this soap and it makes my hands feel clean &amp; smooth without drying them out totally.</li>
            <li>Same old Foam Soap, much better price!</li>
            <li>It is def the real product, not a fake like others.</li>
            <li>It is what it is, an effective way to dispense soap without the mess.</li>
            <li>The smell is incredible, it&#x27;s sweet without being overwhelming (and no, it doesn&#x27;t have that rubbing alcohol smell commonly associated with soaps from Victoria&#x27;s Secret either).</li>
            <li>After the first 4 are empty, I&#x27;m either chucking the bottles away (which isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;) or finding another use for them - which isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>Smells really</li>
            <li>VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li>someone set me straight as to how it should look/feel like?</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use.  </li>
            <li>larger bottle was available.</li>
            <li>Much of the soap had leaked out into the surrounding bubble wrap and plastic surrounding the item.</li>
            <li>After buying the individual pumps for kitchen &amp; bath, this refill size is very economical.  </li>
            <li>But I remain annoyed by the fact that Dial&#x27;s foaming soap, which has more water by weight and volume than regular liquid soap (and is much more quickly consumed) sells at a significant premium to regular liquid soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product from a trusted brand, a bit more expensive here than at the store ($5 store vs almost $9 here), but I did purchase simply because of convenience since I was almost out.  </li>
            <li>Well, that and I&#x27;d love it if it came in other scents just so I&#x27;d have something new to try.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and these refills make it cheaper to use, but the order was a soapy mess when it came in.</li>
            <li>No substance to it, just a little  more than water.</li>
            <li>I love the foaming soap because it doesn&#x27;t drip and make a mess!  </li>
            <li>New 6 foamings soaps would have costed the same.</li>
            <li>We selected this large size container of foaming hand wash to refill smaller sink-side containers that were about empty.</li>
            <li>scent is very light - I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to heavy perfumes and this doesn&#x27;t make me ill in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I use it as a refill soap in my kitchen and have found it does not dry my hands out at all.</li>
            <li>Poured it into a container and it looks VERY watered down.</li>

            <li> the hand soap was the same as the little bottles</li>
            <li> (i thought that was standard) and it was leaking a little bit.</li>
            <li> but it was hard for me to open the cap and to pour the liquid to the smaller container.</li>
            <li> Just pour it into your empty Bath and Body Works foaming soap bottle</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, in order to get the foaming anti-bacterial soap, one has to purchase either a single pump dispenser or, as I did, a 4-pack from Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li> Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers talk about the product being &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> One person holds the dispenser down while the other person squirts in the soap.</li>
            <li> It feels like watered down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not - refilling those little bottles is going to be a two-person job.</li>
            <li> It was leaking a little bit.</li>
            <li> I expected liquid soap to be a little thick and viscous but this one looked like it</li>
            <li> We finally have a scent that we never get tired of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that made it less soapy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am getting rid of the bar soap in my half bath!</li>
            <li> This foaming hand wash is convenient, no more mess.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have a sweet-smelling mess on your hands when you screw the dispenser together again!</li>
            <li> It is already half way down!!!</li>
            <li> bottle is a little hard to manipulate if you&#x27;re picking it up with one hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green water!</li>
            <li> in my area, and although I recycle, I felt guilty for buying the smaller bottles over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I bought some soap dispensers for both bathrooms and found that the liquid soap I got at Costco was too thick and after awhile would no pump.  </li>
            <li> I like the dial foam soap because it seems to rinse off my hands cleaner than some others do, as in tthey seem to leave a film of sorts behind.</li>
            <li> I mean, who can go wrong with a foaming hand soap?  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because I&#x27;ve been unable to locate a refill size of foaming liquid soap at any of the retail outlets (grocery stores, Target, Wal-Mart, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not to crazy about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> PATHETIC PATHETIC...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.Smells really good----  cleans well AND you just refill the bottles you already have on the counter----SAVES MONEY&lt;br /&gt;And VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li> you are not going to like this. the hand soap was the same as the little bottles but it was hard for me to open the cap and to pour the liquid to the smaller container. it was not overall the wisest buy for a handicap person. I would not be writing this if you had not forced my hand by your too many email requests</li>
            <li> I bought this item out of frustration that none of the stores in my hometown sell refill bottles. For some odd reason, in order to get the foaming anti-bacterial soap, one has to purchase either a single pump dispenser or, as I did, a 4-pack from Sam&#x27;s Club. Not helpful! After the first 4 are empty, I&#x27;m either chucking the bottles away (which isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;) or finding another use for them - which isn&#x27;t easy. I&#x27;ve been through Walmart, Sam&#x27;s Club, BJs, Publix, and even Walgreens and no one sells the refill bottle. So, my last resort was looking through Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light - I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to heavy perfumes and this doesn&#x27;t make me ill in the slightest. Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers talk about the product being &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s supposed to be that way. This is a FOAMING soap. It&#x27;s not going to behave like dish soap or regular hand soap. That&#x27;d be like comparing a tangerine to a blood orange, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little hard to manipulate if you&#x27;re picking it up with one hand. Unless you&#x27;re really talented - and I&#x27;m not - refilling those little bottles is going to be a two-person job. One person holds the dispenser down while the other person squirts in the soap. That&#x27;s the ONLY reason I gave it a 4 star performance. Well, that and I&#x27;d love it if it came in other scents just so I&#x27;d have something new to try.</li>
            <li> 5/5.  This product sits on my bathroom closet shelf very nicely and looks great.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  My wife told me we needed a foaming soap refill but neglected to mention that we wouldn&#x27;t need it until next year, as we&#x27;ve just opened our last one of the same size.</li>
            <li> This foaming soap is great. We were originally using the foaming soap refill from Target when we got feed up of the soap coming out watery and not foaming. The Dial soap is the complete opposite as it foams up great and is not watery like the Target brand.</li>
            <li> Cleans. Nice scent. Economical. What else do you need?</li>
            <li> Great! It is such a money saver. It is def the real product, not a fake like others. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> We use this foaming hand wash all the time. The large refill bottle is very convenient and cost effective but seldom can find it in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  After buying the individual pumps for kitchen &amp; bath, this refill size is very economical.  Since I can&#x27;t purchase this size locally, I was happy to discover it was available on Amazon.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Came quickly......good</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product - the foaming quality makes it easy to control the quantity used and the scent is clean and pure.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild, but it is pleasant.  It is a better alternative to buying a new soap dispenser with soap each time it runs out.</li>
            <li> Just received it in the mail...There was no seal under that cap (i thought that was standard) and it was leaking a little bit. Poured it into a container and it looks VERY watered down. I expected liquid soap to be a little thick and viscous but this one looked like it 50/50 water/soap. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it and it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; as described. Has anyone else had that problem or is it just me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see on the front label that it should be used with the Dial special pump. I&#x27;m currently using a SoftSoap pump. I&#x27;m not sure if that made it less soapy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can someone set me straight as to how it should look/feel like? Usually I would buy the Lavender SoftSoap and that one is awesome but this time I decided to go cheap and search around for more soap for my dollar. Shouldn&#x27;t have done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to add the seller:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olde Dominion Shoppe</li>
            <li> It is what it is, an effective way to dispense soap without the mess. I am now a convert from the heavier &amp;#34;syrupy&amp;#34; soap to the foam.</li>
            <li> I bought some soap dispensers for both bathrooms and found that the liquid soap I got at Costco was too thick and after awhile would no pump.  This is much lighter and works fine.</li>
            <li> This is the foaming type of soap.  It is not a glob of soap in your hand but a foamy thing.  This smells nice and gets my hands clean.  I am a fan of soap and this one has my approval.</li>
            <li> I found this soap in Walgreens but could not find the refills till I looked on Amazon. I love the soap and am so glad to find the refill. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap and it makes my hands feel clean &amp; smooth without drying them out totally.</li>
            <li> Love this foaming hand soap</li>
            <li> I like the dial foam soap because it seems to rinse off my hands cleaner than some others do, as in tthey seem to leave a film of sorts behind.</li>
            <li> I am having the same problems as one of the customer has experienced. There is no seal under that cap.  It was leaking a little bit. It feels like watered down. I poured it into a dial bottle yesterday. It is already half way down!!! it is supposed to last longer than that.  it does not foam as described. it leaved film on my hands. I will not buy it again. And i would not recommend it to anyone. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This foam soap is perfect for those on a budget.  Just pour it into your empty Bath and Body Works foaming soap bottle and it&#x27;s ready to use.  It will save your at least $50 worth of soap a year.  The smell is incredible, it&#x27;s sweet without being overwhelming (and no, it doesn&#x27;t have that rubbing alcohol smell commonly associated with soaps from Victoria&#x27;s Secret either).</li>
            <li> We selected this large size container of foaming hand wash to refill smaller sink-side containers that were about empty. The product is excellent and avoids the use of bars of soap that can get rather messy at times. although we no longer have children at home, the foaming hand wash might make it easier to encourage youngsters to keep their hands clean. Overall, a good easy to use product that requires no maintenance or cleaning of soap dishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish larger bottle was available.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a refill of the smaller pump dispensers that I purchased from amazon.  Well, that was all, but amazon required 4 more words.</li>
            <li> What can you say about soap, it smells good and works very well and the price was good, it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Same old Foam Soap, much better price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green water! No thickness to it. It does suds up but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - pleasant to use, nice aroma, leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Since the dispensers are built to last quite a while, refilling them makes sense. Just make sure you don&#x27;t go over the maximum fill mark or you&#x27;ll have a sweet-smelling mess on your hands when you screw the dispenser together again!</li>
            <li> great stuff.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This foaming hand wash is convenient, no more mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because I&#x27;ve been unable to locate a refill size of foaming liquid soap at any of the retail outlets (grocery stores, Target, Wal-Mart, etc.) in my area, and although I recycle, I felt guilty for buying the smaller bottles over and over again.  Now I can refill them.  But I remain annoyed by the fact that Dial&#x27;s foaming soap, which has more water by weight and volume than regular liquid soap (and is much more quickly consumed) sells at a significant premium to regular liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Hard to find foaming liquid soap, especially at a great price. This product was packaged great in case of leakage and well worth the value. Pleased to have it, makes washing hands more fun for everyone.</li>
            <li> Not to crazy about the fragrance. But that don&#x27;t hang around long. It rinsesoff better then oter bottle liquid soap</li>
            <li> I love the foaming soap because it doesn&#x27;t drip and make a mess!  i am getting rid of the bar soap in my half bath!</li>
            <li> I love this soap and these refills make it cheaper to use, but the order was a soapy mess when it came in. Hoping this was a one time problem, I&#x27;ll update the next time I order more.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this foam soap. It came wrapped and package great, no leaks. I use it as a refill soap in my kitchen and have found it does not dry my hands out at all.</li>
            <li> Good soap and smells good</li>
            <li> Item does not have a good seal on the cap. Much of the soap had leaked out into the surrounding bubble wrap and plastic surrounding the item.</li>
            <li> It was clear that this bottle was filled with water with probably 10% of it being soap. PATHETIC PATHETIC...a total rip off.</li>
            <li> I mean, who can go wrong with a foaming hand soap?  It&#x27;s a good product from a trusted brand, a bit more expensive here than at the store ($5 store vs almost $9 here), but I did purchase simply because of convenience since I was almost out.  So, I knew what I was getting for the buck.  Otherwise, a fairly good product that I would buy again, but at the lower cost.</li>
            <li> No substance to it, just a little  more than water. - I  like Dial but I won&#x27;t get this again;</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> 1. No great.not bad.&lt;br /&gt;2. Was expecting more refills . Its can upto 6 refills. New 6 foamings soaps would have costed the same. Nothing advantageous of this.&lt;br /&gt;3. Odorless almost.</li>
            <li> We have three smaller bottles we refill.  It produces a foam hand wash that is a light pear scent and lovely.  We finally have a scent that we never get tired of.</li>
