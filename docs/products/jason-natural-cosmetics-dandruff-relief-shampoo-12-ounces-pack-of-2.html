            <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp without drying the skin out.</li>
            <li>the purpose of this product is great its just the smell of the shampoo which is tripping me up.</li>
            <li>I never would have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it</li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>Great Dandruff Shampoo</li>
            <li>GREAT product, can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li>and my head is still doing great.</li>
            <li>A great product&lt;</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>but my course curly hair looks and feels better than it has since I was a kid!!</li>
            <li>Very nice for the oily</li>
            <li>Sulphur is know to be very effective in helping with scalp problems, but the smell is the price to pay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective at treating my dandruff while being just a pleasant and soothing product.  </li>
            <li>But, oh my goodness it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This helped in one use, beyond amazing with 2 uses!</li>
            <li>I find that this shampoo is a wonderful addition to my regimen for maintaining a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>Best dandruff shampoo for the price for sure.</li>
            <li>But worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong sulfurous odor!  </li>
            <li>It is good, takes away the dandruff after a couple of washed.</li>
            <li>so, i bought this product because it got fairly good reviews</li>
            <li>I find that this product works good.</li>
            <li>I give it four stars because I find that as good as it is</li>
            <li>Good smelling conditioner helps to combat the shampoos odor.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>My skin prefers a good 15 minute treatment in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is a great and effective alternative to the coal tar and selenic?</li>
            <li>all of the oils in it are so good for you.</li>
            <li>so i suggest u buy a good scented conditioner to go with this preferably by jason</li>
            <li>Good for people like me with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>There is still a bit of dandruff here and there, but not like there used to be (brush and braid her hair nightly, so I get a chance to take a good look).</li>
            <li>that being said, it does feel good on the scalp,</li>
            <li>do this for a good 30 seconds or so</li>
            <li>if you use a washcloth or loofah, rinse it out really good when you are done, with the shampoo in your hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to use a good amount</li>
            <li>Nothing over the counter seemed to do him any good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend a good conditioner as this shampoo severely dries out the hair.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of stopping the iching and flaking, gets ride of oil and scalp odor as well.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found what I needed with Jason&#x27;s &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;, since the reviews were so good, but no luck.</li>
            <li>Jason has worked well and leaves hair looking good.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo would be good for those who wash their hair every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li>Initially I loved the product, for I felt it was helping with my dandruff problem</li>
            <li>And as embarrassing as it sounds, this doesn&#x27;t happen because you don&#x27;t take good care of your hair.</li>
            <li>helps with the dandruff issue fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good Diet and exercise also help in keeping away dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and will continue purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is awesome and is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I have this stuff.</li>
            <li>the scent is so lovely that when the bottle arrived at my work place,&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed some on just to smell it!  </li>
            <li>I love Jason&#x27;s shampoos!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>I doubt I can repair any of that now, but I feel much better about myself and have even stopped checking for flakes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I love that product, helped a lot with scalp itchiness !</li>
            <li>and I feel confident that my scalp has improved!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>After so many years of having dandruff, this shampoo was a miracle!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things and this has done wonders!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant, but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li>I guess that bothers some people; I find it pleasant and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>it is very good product , despite its strong smell :)</li>
            <li>It works fine and was a great price.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>but it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I felt a burning sensation, and i liked it and kept massaging it all over..</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too--he always tells me I smell nice after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own but make me, my shower, and my bath towels, STINK.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice in shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it works really good.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a while because it is effective for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>what anyone was talking about when it came to just how effective this was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an effective dandruff-control shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp for years.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results are excellent, both my daughter and I are showing much improved signs, and not scratching even close to what we used to.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the name of (the one that has some kind of anti-fungal agent).  </li>
            <li>The smell is more earthy but still good.</li>
            <li>It works well on dandruff as well as making the room smell nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sulfur or the rosemary, but after years of trying product after product (even the nice sulfate-free ones), this has been my saving</li>
            <li>but I kind of like the sulfur smell.  </li>
            <li>I find that I really like Neutrogena T-Gel the best of all the brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own).  </li>
            <li>Before you wash with it, it has a nice herbal aroma.</li>
            <li>so I am glad that amazon sells it at a good price.</li>
            <li>Effective formula, no flakes.</li>
            <li>Then I tried working a solution of coconut oil melted in warm water into my scalp, and rubbing apple cider vinegar into my scalp, but those attempts didn&#x27;t solve my problem, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not understand how this product has gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Plus I liked the tingling feeling when I&#x27;d leave it on for 3 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>it has a burning scent, but the both of us agree it is worth it!!!    </li>
            <li>I am so excited and relieved to have found this product!!</li>
            <li>so be sure to grab a generous amount of shampoo and really massage it into your scalp for the best results.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong smell that tends to linger so be prepared.</li>
            <li>But thing is, this has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all it has a very STRONG smell.</li>
            <li>i do not usually write reviews but havent been so impressed with a product as i am with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was the best one by far!  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it has a nice smell to it on its own, and on top of that it is all natural - awesome!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dandruff treatment I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best natural shampoo I found for dandruff</li>
            <li>My SLS free tea tree shampoo, also by JASON, does just as much good as this stuff.    </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt; JASON dandruff shampoo is by far the best thing I have ever put on my head.</li>
            <li>healthy which trust me is an amazing feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that&#x27;s the ingredient that makes it effective.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong sulfur smell!</li>
            <li>Great Natural product smells good too</li>
            <li>Smells great and really works!</li>
            <li>Flakes are greatly reduced after first use</li>
            <li>This is a great product that works really well!  </li>
            <li>The ingredients seem good, the scent is not bad, the price is alright, but the performence is not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they were too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I like this product as well, but it does smell kind of strong.</li>
            <li>silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very bummed because my scalp was better (once I got over the smell) but it ruined a beautiful goldplated necklace my husband gave me for Mother&#x27;s Day one year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with 4b hair and this shampoo has allowed me to be dandruff free for up to 2 weeks after shampooing, versus having dandruff the day after washing for most of my life!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to leave it in for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The breakouts have stopped and my scalp and hair feel much better.</li>
            <li>Love the cooling feeling on my scalp</li>
            <li>I had to do something to preserve the sexy.  </li>
            <li>After one use,  I noticed that the flaking was drastically better.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more.  </li>
            <li>OK, I have had some kinda dandruff/dry scalp thing going on for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully worth some good karma</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll be buying more of this product after all.</li>
            <li>I think the smell bothered me more than anything, it&#x27;s a mix of smokiness and chemical.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 1.5 months just to be sure</li>
            <li>and I love the products.</li>
            <li>Better if you use it with another shampoo .</li>
            <li>My biggest problem was that most of the OTC products were burning my daughter&#x27;s skin, not to mention what they were doing to her</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried at this point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not up to the skipping more than a day of use, yet.</li>
            <li>Most reviews made this sound amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well and it works much better then all the acne products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I think the stuff might work if it didn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, but it does, and that has ALWAYS exacerbated my condition much more than help it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>It is concentrated so I get more for my dollar.</li>
            <li>Also,due to the Neem Oil in it, I was able to use it to treat my daughter,with eczema for lice.</li>
            <li>I did some research and know that herbal products work so well for so many things and decided to try the JASON Dandruff Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think the Tea Tree and Rosemary come through more than the Sulfer smell.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars (can I add 1 more?)...</li>
            <li>However, as others have already remarked on, the smell can be overpowering, especially first thing in the morning (which is when I shower).  </li>
            <li>and I could feel a fiery burn where there was the most dandruff and itchiness.</li>
            <li>and I find I haveto use more than a quarter-sized dollop to get it spread/suds up my scalp &amp; hair)</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>After that you can start using it once every week like me and it does a perfect job of preventing the dandruff itch from coming back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, I will keep using it since I have it but probably will keep looking for a better shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It has made this most noticeable difference in my dandruff epidemic and I am truly grateful.</li>
            <li>My friend gave me a bottle of this magic shampoo when she noticed my &amp;#34;str-excema&amp;#34; (stress induced scalp insanity)...</li>
            <li>The price is better than brands in a store, too.</li>
            <li>The scent of it is just okay too.  </li>
            <li>Now that she&#x27;s a tween, it bothers her more than it used to.</li>
            <li>I took two more showers after using this today and I still can&#x27;t get the stink off.</li>
            <li>One thing I find interesting is there&#x27;s no ingredients list on the bottle, and no directions either.  </li>
            <li>but I think it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars mostly because of what it&#x27;s done for my scalp so it delivers on that as advertised.</li>
            <li>Shampoos &amp; creams can make it feel better for awhile. .  </li>
            <li>But I am having better luck with the natural/ organic products.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s consistency was much more like conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>but you can use as needed for more severe cases.</li>
            <li>so hopefully it even works better with time.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from severe burning and itching scalp for years also and have not been able to find any help.</li>
            <li>This shampoo popped up to the top of my search results.  </li>
            <li>the results were even better.  </li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than being itchy and/or flakey.</li>
            <li>This worked better for my beard than Beard Oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helped leave my hair softer and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all have done nothing but cause more of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Also my hair feels healthy after using it.</li>
            <li>My son said that he felt it worked better if he let the shampoo sit on his scalp for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>I do wish the fragrance was better though...</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair so more foam makes me feel like I&#x27;ve done a better job washing each strand.</li>
            <li>it is a better I used in shampoo.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders worked okay for a while, but we wanted something a bit better.</li>
            <li>Provided much better relief than Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this most days for over a week now leaving on for 5-6 minutes each time, in hopes of relieving itching and scabby bumps.</li>
            <li>My son uses this for his scalp and it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>used for more than 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Infact I have not been able to find this for a while and stumbled on it by accident.  </li>
            <li>Needed an alternative to dandruff shampoos that have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is used in most of the well known brands to create foam.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Really works great and doesn&#x27;t harm my hair.</li>
            <li>After researching more about my problem, I believe I am in the &amp;#34;smelly hair syndrome&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does seem to get better as you continue to use it so don&#x27;t give up after just one use.</li>
            <li>and they said it wasn&#x27;t so that made me feel better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the smell too</li>
            <li>I love Rosemary and Olive</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>glad I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product it contained no sulfates but another derivative, which I felt would be okay at the time.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find a cure.</li>
            <li>I have used all famous shampoos, though they gave relief when I used them, there was nothing permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a magical product and I wonder why I did not find this thing two years ago.</li>
            <li>The itchiness, the dryness and even most of the flakiness were gone almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Both she and dad love the way their hair feels and looks, it adds body and shine.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this shampoo - it&#x27;s more creamy like a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY dandruff shampoos over the years.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair healthy, and minimizes frizz.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Head and shoulders work much better than this shampoo anyday.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better then</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t touched the  steroids in many months.</li>
            <li>I rarely check my scalp anymore, just once in awhile to make sure all is good.</li>
            <li>, i just wish that it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my girlfriend bought this for me</li>
            <li>I have agreed to give it up because I don&#x27;t think it is doing any better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it did what I needed plus gives my hair anature shine, this I will get again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on my way to a clean and healthy scalp!</li>
            <li>it smells kind of minty and clean, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I feel my scalp is very clean now and</li>
            <li>The cool tingling sensation that built up over time was relaxing and amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the new formula with no tea tree oil and it works great.</li>
            <li>It works well, but dry out the hair a bit so best if followed by some conditioner.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but not horrible in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Works good smells good enough.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and non toxic, and also it gives great results.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too medicinal (more herbal) and when compared to the Neutrogena tar-like product, its light years better.</li>
            <li>Squeeky &amp;lt;sp&gt; clean!</li>
            <li>This stuff does a fantastic job of controlling my psoriasis/dandruff while also keeping my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I love that this shampoo is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok at keeping it flake free in the winter.</li>
            <li>, my issues though, centered more around a burning and itching scalp than dandruff (which was an issue as well, just not my primary concern).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really think this gets rid of dandruff, but it helps make your scalp feel good.  </li>
            <li>I mix the shampoo with another, more pleasant smelling natural shampoo, to lessen this effect.</li>
            <li>This has had the greatest positive effect by far.</li>
            <li>I am more than excited about this product</li>
            <li>He uses it every other day, as it does get greasy, and its great!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not bad at all!</li>
            <li>Does have a medicinal smell from the sulfur but my hair products covered it up easily.</li>
            <li>I almost feel like I need to use another shampoo on top of it to truly get it clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong when combating the problem.  </li>
            <li>So far so good this product :-)</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but I use a scented conditioner so it doesn&#x27;t smell once my hair is styled.</li>
            <li>The sulfur smell is strong but who cares.</li>
            <li>the downside, it does smell strongly of something that reminds me of eucalyptus or menthol.</li>
            <li>The smell to me is not that strong .</li>
            <li>Not to mention when you workout or sweat the smell comes out so strong people around you can smell it and let me tell you...</li>
            <li>Strong smell, but</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a strong odor, comparable to coal-tar shampoos, but I don&#x27;t mind because it gets rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li>It must be some strong stuff because even if I use another shampoo afterwards the smell remains in my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and natural on its own.</li>
            <li>Cudos to Jason and their dedication to put out high quality products at a fair price.</li>
            <li>This product is a miracle in that it&#x27;s natural and works AMAZINGLY to get rid of dandruff/psoriasis!</li>
            <li>It leaves your scalp feeling refreshed and cool and smelling much better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>You can air yourself out some, but in any enclosed space, you will smell kind of funny.</li>
            <li>Though the first fragrant layer of this shampoo is nice and herbally my husband</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true, my scalp is better.</li>
            <li>I use topix benzoyl peroxide with aloe vera for my face and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>As a side note, my lowlights are fine (brunette)</li>
            <li>very impressed I&#x27;ve had scalp issues all life and previously just rotated products</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>It washes out just fine, lathers well too.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Jason was the first dandruff shampoo we tried and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>and it controls my dandruff just fine</li>
            <li>My son is allergic to a certain chemical found in most dandruff type shampoos and prescription shampoo had many side effects</li>
            <li>The huge DANDRUFF display on the bottle doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li>I believe that has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the prettiest for shampoo, but it&#x27;s way easier for me to deal with than huge chunks of flakes all over my clothes.</li>
            <li>the huge downside is the sulfur..</li>
            <li>Works great, I only use it once a week</li>
            <li>same great formula\\</li>
            <li>and flake- free.</li>
            <li>It is important to remember to leave the shampoo in your hair for about 2 minutes before rinsing it out to let it do its job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I went back and read those reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall great product</li>
            <li>I dont use it everyday but it has been working great!</li>
            <li>I always use sulfate free shampoos/conditioners but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li>I need a sulfate free shampoo because of a the infusium hair treatment (like a keratin treatment) which I had done.</li>
            <li>Compared to Head and shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but I will keep using it until I find a sulfate free shampoo with Zinc in it.</li>
            <li>am now 100% flake free because of this product</li>
            <li>and I hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li>Use this product 2-3 X per week and have been dandruff free for years.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>and it keeps my scalp flake and crust free.</li>
            <li>My scalp condition has improved greatly over the last year</li>
            <li>While in the process of shampooing my hair, I did enjoy the sensation and smell.</li>
            <li>One child is scab/flake free already.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to hop on the anti-artificial scent band wagon or if you enjoy earthy smells, then you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the smell is really medicated and kind of reminds me of a retirement home smell.</li>
            <li>So, now the search is on for a natural shampoo that keeps my curls looking good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and my jewelry oxidized.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near as good as the conditioner and dandruff shampoo in one.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, used it 2 times so far, seems to be helping the dandruff, still have some flakes</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Out of all the dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used and tested, this is by far the most effective ...</li>
            <li>(That price is cheap and very worth it by the way.)  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad but so strong .</li>
            <li>Not bad, but strong.</li>
            <li>I have prob tried everything from home made remedies (which are very useful), to Flax oil, to ignoring it, to this.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try it since he liked it, but it has a very strong smell and because I only wash my hair twice/week, the smell lingered for days!  </li>
            <li>On the side note, it does leave your hair feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The shampoo helps to prevent skin dryness and irritation, but it has very strong and unusual smell, maybe these are oils...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can dry your hair out the way all dandruff shampoos can so just make sure you have a good conditioner to apply to your hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>:) It might smell funny, but it works.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this shampoo in an effort to get rid of head lice.</li>
            <li>Not artificial!</li>
            <li>Worth trying!  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product, I suffer from Seb Dermatitis and this has completely eliminated my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Okay, at first I had no idea</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this shampoo to treat my itchy scalp+dandruff after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find a natural shampoo for my issue.  </li>
            <li>You probably need to make sure this stuff covers ALL of your hair until the smell goes away the first time.  </li>
            <li>but it is not a repulsive smell but just a unique smell.</li>
            <li>Cheap, simple, and so far works the best for me.</li>
            <li>I tried many products and nothing seemed to consistently do the job.</li>
            <li>So, great shampoo for men (or those with short hair), but not the best for us ladies with long hair and sensitive noses!</li>
            <li>after emailing both the seller and Amazon, I still don&#x27;t know if they still make the original formula, nor if anything will be done about the misleading advertising...</li>
            <li>it is worth your time and money to try this shampoo!</li>
            <li>but it did significantly reduce my dandruff post pregnancy.</li>
            <li>At first, it seemed like it made it better.</li>
            <li>but it does clean well.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to all of the harsh chemicals in most shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair does not feel clean.  </li>
            <li>my hair stays clean longer.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s free of many not-so-good ingredients, and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li>I also pair this with an anti-residue shampoo once a week to really clean and remove all the gunk from my hair, including the sulfur in the Jason Dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does clean my hair well and no conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li>Was very worried about the effects of that strong shampoo on my hair and was looking for something more natural but effective.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets my hair really clean</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great in controlling dry scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li>I had to clean it up, and I lost a substantial amount of product -</li>
            <li>just love this stuff, and am still in a state of disbelief over the fact that my scalp is healthy and completely flake-free.  </li>
            <li>Found Jason and its been about 2 years,it has been keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li>My scalp is clear and healthy!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is mild relative to most, and extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried sulphur shampoos before but there must be something special about the combination of ingredients in the Jason shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li>It started working right away!  </li>
            <li>and I could go up to three days without having to use the shampoo before my scalp got a little bit itchy which has been incredibly liberating.</li>
            <li>After each wash, I feel my scalp is not itchy any more and pretty fresh.</li>
            <li>This may be great for some, but please be careful.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>He tried it &amp; has had such good results.  </li>
            <li>I should mention, we tried Selsun Blue, T-Gel &amp; good ol&#x27; Head &amp; Shoulders before buying this and nothing worked until this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the dandruff go away forever, but it keeps it pretty under control, and it&#x27;s a natural product, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product about six months ago because my scalp was in good condition after regular use of Jason&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I also use nice conditioners like Coolaulin from Lush and MOP Leave-</li>
            <li>Is also a good regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fixing my scalp and making me and my home and all around me better and happier.    </li>
            <li>We used Netrogena T-Gel, and that smell is much more pungent and would make our whole upstairs</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this instead of the 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that I love so much.</li>
            <li>Oh sweet Jesus.</li>
            <li>Just remember to leave The Jason shampoo on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure that it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I thought initially that it is a good thing - those smelly dandruff fighting agents.</li>
            <li>Overall really good dandruff shampoo that cleans well and stops flakes/scalp odor</li>
            <li>Because of all the good reviews on this product I decided to try it for my moderate to severe dandruff.</li>
            <li>It took nothing to rinse it out with cool water, as well.  </li>
            <li>so there is a pretty strong sulfur smell that lingers for a day.</li>
            <li>I had no idea what to do because the large flakes of skin and soreness, in addition to the itching were not making me an attractive female.  </li>
            <li>I did not next best thing in the entire world.  </li>
            <li>But, since using Jason, my dandruff hasn&#x27;t returned, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw, and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade away as quickly at all.     </li>
            <li>I use many herbal products and love shampoos that are herbal and essential oil based anyway.</li>
            <li>As I got older, I started coloring my hair more to cover my premature grays.</li>
            <li>This is not to say this product is a miracle shampoo; I still have some mild itchiness at the places</li>
            <li>I received in quick time just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has always had mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>It is nice to finally not have to worry about all those huge flakes.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of scalp dermititis</li>
            <li>So if your head is super itchy from the flakes</li>
            <li>one&#x27;s smell is fairly mild.</li>
            <li>You will quickly notice a difference when you treat your scalp well.</li>
            <li>Prior to buying this shampoo I have NEVER, NEVER been able to go more than three days without washing my hair, now I can go 4-5.  </li>
            <li>I got more again, and sure enough, it went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like a mild soapy smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pungent odor and the way it leaves hair looking super greasy is intolerable.</li>
            <li>Quick Summary:&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>but I still love it for the fact that it leaves my hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li>right now, my scalp feels soothed and clean.</li>
            <li>I tried all other brands of dandruff shampoo and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products I have tried, this shampoo is perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This shampoo worked the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, all natural, but has a very strong smell which I&#x27;m not sure if everyone is ok with it.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice much of any smell, which people claim is incredibly strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li>even as a woman, I really like the smell, as it&#x27;s not too floral, but rather has a strong herbal scent (medicinal to some).</li>
            <li>I just spray some hairspray on when it&#x27;s dry and that takes away a good amount of it.   </li>
            <li>Just be ready for a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting the problem for many years - very sensitive skin, so any changes in water/hair care/stress level would impact my scalp immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i use aubrey primrose every other day and that is amazing as well!</li>
            <li>Highly recomend it!!!</li>
            <li>After the first application, the itchiness on my scalp was gone!</li>
            <li>My own personal experience of dry scalp and white flaky dandruff is best solved by the H2O and ACV.</li>
            <li>Great stuff that combats psoriasis, eczema and dandruff without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has it been AMAZING for my dandruff</li>
            <li>In just a few weeks the condition of my scalp improved greatly using this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything that is available at Wal-Mart and a product from the doctor and none of it really worked.</li>
            <li>I have have been so happy I found my self crying sometimes.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well considering it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this and the odor was a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li>The old version without the rosemary etc. was better.</li>
            <li>I am dandruft free after so many years of trying different products.</li>
            <li>It did an okay job as far as that went...</li>
            <li>Hair is soft after, love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Overall it was kind of a hit or miss affair with dandruff.</li>
            <li>Since having my second baby, my hair has been kind of out of whack.</li>
            <li>In my efforts to move towards more natural products, I found this shampoo, read the reviews, and decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>Natural dandruff shampoo that is safe for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off.</li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>That sounds like fun.</li>
            <li>After all isn&#x27;t a couple of years of growing your hair out worth getting rid of flakes forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil does have a distinct smell but nothing compared to a tar based product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a more natural way to take care of dandruff.</li>
            <li>not looked at all the ingredients too closely but know that most of them are Natural.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>The dandruff is under far better control.</li>
            <li>It only kind of worked for me.</li>
            <li>well worth it for what it does.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>an added benefit, the recurring pink spots with scaly skin on top that I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for years have mostly cleared up, and I think my hair looks healthier than at any time I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried a couple all-natural-esque products for dandruff and dry scalp and this by far has shown the best results, highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>That being said I don&#x27;t mind it too much though I usually use a conditioner after the fact just to add a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was full of tea tree oil, neem oil, and without sudsing agents, which just dry you out anyway.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other shampoos and conditioner but most do not work that</li>
            <li>and I take super hot showers</li>
            <li>Also, it has a very distinct smell that isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, and I&#x27;m usually a fan of earthy scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The odor from this product is a distinct Sulfur Odor, is VERY strong, WILL make your clothes, hairbrush, even fingers smell like sulfur, even 2 days after you last washed your hair!  </li>
            <li>you can put up with the smell of sulphur, then this would be a good product for controlling dandruff and other scalp issues.</li>
            <li>Works good in any other season, But</li>
            <li>As always I was right and the shampoo did wonders on my hair</li>
            <li>It worked right away.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is intentional, after all people buy patchouli on purpose, right?</li>
            <li>That is right, I said \\&quot;GOES</li>
            <li>I am on week 3 right now, and have not had ANY problems.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and &#x27;real&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised Jason made my scalp feel &amp; look better when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because as a practicing &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; I needed a sulfate free dandruff shampoo that would treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>At first it feels like it is not lathering well, but if you keep at it, and then rinse and repeat, the second application lathers up really nicely.  </li>
            <li>it does have an odd pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>For a little better scent I simply use a good light conditioner and that takes care of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I can combat any slight lingering sulfur smell by rinsing really well with some distilled water and using a great smelling coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li>No overwhelming smell, works great.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say that after 29 yrs my scalp is over 80 % better after only a few uses..</li>
            <li>Leaves your scalp feeling super soothed and is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin &amp; sometimes get mild dandruff (on days when I don&#x27;t sleep as much as I should)  </li>
            <li>Amazing results after a single</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit intense, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Without good conditioner, it&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the smell of this product is VERY intense.</li>
            <li>no problems //  very fast service</li>
            <li>First of all, it has a very comfortable fragrance taste; secondly, remove dandruff effect</li>
            <li>So I was thinking OMG, great, now which of the million products on the market will truly clean (without over-stripping) and moisturize my poor scalp??  </li>
            <li>In fact, I strayed last week and used a product that I thought would be better.  </li>
            <li>I did some research via Google &amp; many others with this same problem</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, the shampoo seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smelled funny.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty off-putting though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos since then.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and within the first week of use, the itching has gone away on my head</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Not any better than selsun blue.  </li>
            <li>The smell is like a lot of chemical-free beauty products, and smells like essential oils, most noticeably, tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks washing everyother day, my scalp is feeling so much calmer!</li>
            <li>Besides, the shampoo really works so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>; heck, since there&#x27;s not even the slightest irritation, there really isn&#x27;t even that anymore!    </li>
            <li>I see no dandruff for the first couple days and just a fleck here and there afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but the benefits of my facial skin was even better.  </li>
            <li>This was the first dandruff shampoo I ever tried.</li>
            <li>I scrolled up and sure enough, the Amazon directions stated this.</li>
            <li>They are affordable and work really well!</li>
            <li>I admired the smell out of the bottle when we first got this.</li>
            <li>This thing worked for me since the first use.</li>
            <li>Different shampoos might work for different people but this one was definitely for me and my condition and so just wanted to thank the makers of this awesome product!!</li>
            <li>Tried this shampoo and it worked so fast!</li>
            <li>I used it for a week to make sure, but it didn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li>okay, so i have come to the very specific description of the &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; i have mentioned:</li>
            <li>This shampoo got rid of all my dandruff after the first go.</li>
            <li>Takes the itching and dermititis away but your hair will really smell like sulfur; worth it if you want to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>This worked the even after the first wash.</li>
            <li>note, the bacteria will come back, see the directions below for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had flaky dandruff, but I&#x27;ve had a constantly itchy, irritated scalp for many years.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe dandruff</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first JASON product I&#x27;d used</li>
            <li>It definitely seems to control my dandruff better than products like Head and Shoulders that don&#x27;t contain the antifungal properties of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never failed my scalp.</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;ve been buying products for years and years on Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to leave a review on a product.  </li>
            <li>First off, it smells to me exactly like Tums or Pepto Bismol...</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it actually works better than Sebulex.  </li>
            <li>Etching was gone the first time.</li>
            <li>It fades away after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo is so much like rotten eggs/sulfur that it gave me a headache!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this shampoo twice in a row, make sure you use another regular shampoo to wash this one out before you apply it again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive this exact product.</li>
            <li>Three washes and it was already evident that it was doing its job.</li>
            <li>It is VERY drying!</li>
            <li>I make sure to deep condition after every wash because of it.</li>
            <li>it has evidently changed since they first offered it..</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>i just received this bottle of shampoo and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>the bottle i received has sort of a &amp;#34;cleaning product&amp;#34; smell, my first association was that of &amp;</li>
            <li>When I switched to Jason, the first thing I noticed was the burnt smell was gone</li>
            <li>Man, my scalp was really messed up!</li>
            <li>I tried jason first.. and let me tell you..</li>
            <li>and it started working from the first.</li>
            <li>I guess I was willing to go through anything to get rid of the dandruffs.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I could not stand the smell...</li>
            <li>The one real downside with this shampoo is that it weighs my hair down a good deal.</li>
            <li>( if you use Jason on Sat for example , use the other shampoo on Tues ) because some kind of dandruff require changing between 2 kinds of shampoo and changing the order of using them .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now BEWARE , if you style your hair with a flat iron , hair dryer, or curler the smell transforms into the most foul smell ever.</li>
            <li>I tried many shampoos from popular drugstore brands to expensive organic ones, each using different active ingredients to solve the problem (tea tree, aloe, etc) and this one with sulfur as the main ingredient had the best results.</li>
            <li>I am not joking, or kidding, nor is it that amusing, actually kind of scary.  </li>
            <li>With the conditioner on at the same time, my ends come out nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more gentle on my dyed hair than Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li>Most of my life my hair has been healthy, thick and dark-brownish.</li>
            <li>It smells very strong, which is to be expected as it has sulfur in it.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly thanks to Amazon prime and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t want to spend too much (previously bought Regenepure DR, pretty effective but</li>
            <li>so a strong smell from a natural product doesn&#x27;t normally get to me...</li>
            <li>So at the end of my wits and literally scratching my head as to what would stop the itch, I tried Jason shampoo after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>i enjoyed using it, it lathered well for me and the smell was decent and clean smelling compared to a lot of the other products out there.</li>
            <li>The main smell that you&#x27;ll notice right away is like Pepto Bismol.  </li>
            <li>I have gone very natural with my hair and have only washed with water for the last ten months, but dandruff was getting the best of me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every scalp treatment I can get my paws on.</li>
            <li>^_^&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give the product 5 stars, but I want to see long term how this helps...</li>
            <li>But add to that the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really lather well, and for me, even though I used it for a couple weeks going exactly by directions, it did not work on dandruff.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase as long as its available!</li>
            <li>She and dad love it, and mom is washing her hair again ( a minor miracle).</li>
            <li>Over the span of 18-24 months of monthly/every touch ups and semi-annual full color treatments, my dandruff gradually went from sometimes to frequently to incessant.</li>
            <li>It did turn a sterling silver ring of mine a kind of dark color probably because of the ingredients</li>
            <li>I make sure to rinse my hair thoroughly before using a second, better smelling shampoo (I like Trichomania solid shampoo and Curly Wurly shampoo from Lush).</li>
            <li>Not my favorite look, but I&#x27;ve gotten into a rhythm of using this 1-2x/week and sometimes following with my regular shampoo and conditioner combo, which keeps my scalp healthy and my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural product to use in place of T-Gel for my mild psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>stuff certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that off-putting sulfur smell that i was bracing myself for.</li>
            <li>i cant wait to see what it looks like in a few more washed!</li>
            <li>I wanted something without a high chemical content and have liked other Jason products.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li>Overall I think the smell is fine</li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong as other dandruff shampoos (though it does have a distinct scent, it is not unpleasant like other shampoos we&#x27;ve tried), and she noticed a significant difference after the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>Hard to explain, smells good in bottle and while you apply.</li>
            <li>As other rewiers pointed out, this particular Jason shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve ever found this amazing was a very specific Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo that cost me 30 dollars years ago, and I haven&#x27;t found it since.</li>
            <li>This not only helps combat the problem, the combo of oils helps moisturize which is important to acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>Over time, the sulphur smell doesn&#x27;t linger as much on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I waited until I had used the whole bottle before writing a review.</li>
            <li>and I really think that everyone who is suffering with some type of dandruff condition needs to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my husband who has very oily skin &amp; scalp.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so it can really soak in ...</li>
            <li>$25 is too much for shampoo.)</li>
            <li>I cant speak for how much it relieves dandruff.</li>
            <li>thanks for delivering fast ^_^</li>
            <li>I have even gone through phases of putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp...</li>
            <li>It really is a scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li>The combination works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo it cured my itchy scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li>While this seemed to be working for a while, it isn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is a real blessing.  </li>
            <li>(as JASON is very low-suds</li>
            <li>You can continue activating it to get deeper skin tightening and peels and really stretch its use.  </li>
            <li>still don&#x27;t really notice a smell, though.</li>
            <li>, this dandruff controller really helped i saw results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery with this company.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The smell feels very unclean to me.  </li>
            <li>also, i find i do not have to wash as much ...</li>
            <li>She started using Head &amp; Shoulders, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>It seems like this shampoo is really healing the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I had a VERY itchy scalp before buying this.</li>
            <li>Nothing really clears up scalp psoriasis .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been prescribed steroid foams and creams, and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much stronger than that</li>
            <li>Yes, I think it really works well.</li>
            <li>I really like Jason products, body wash etc.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing + smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, I will give the seller that.</li>
            <li>but if you really need to get rid of flakes don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>My husband has very severe dandruff</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is the combination of herbal oils in the product.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li>I can skip a day without much effect too</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts longer than you might expect.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in how my hair looked and how my scalp felt.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for my son&#x27;s scalp.  </li>
            <li>and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do too much to help my husbands itchiness.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and tingles when I let it sit on my scalp (around 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>it does not seem to have done much for my scalp.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo worked very well.</li>
            <li>The smell is very herbal (Rosemary, Olive, Jojoba)</li>
            <li>which means I really need to take care of my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m flakes free, Totally recommending this product!</li>
            <li>BUT it doesn&#x27;t do too much for my dandruff.</li>
            <li>product came up when I searched sulfate free shampoo, but that is obviously not the case.</li>
            <li>Our dandruff was still there just not as much before shampooing.  </li>
            <li>and I heard her say \\&quot;What kind of sham...</li>
            <li>I have been trying to use more natural products such as soaps and skincare products.  </li>
            <li>searching Amazon showed me this Jason Natural Dandruff Relief Shampoo... and been more than 6 months now with no dandruff, using it once a week only as maintenance</li>
            <li>I too have spent so much money on Salon products - which would help for a day at most.  </li>
            <li>The best test of all is my dark pillows which in the past after a nights sleep would be covered in flakes.  </li>
            <li>I used this Jason Dandruff Shampoo a few times, but I found it not too effective.</li>
            <li>I recently read that coal-tar is a carcinogen and decided to switch to a more natural option since the t-gel wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  </li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like these highly commercialized shampoos, which I could care less about anyways.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough to not burn and the minty smell is harsh at first but becomes pleasant to start the day with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with one of the other reviewers--if you&#x27;re a guy with short hair, this will be a great product because your hair won&#x27;t be near your nose.  </li>
            <li>I took a 5-day trip this past week without bringing this shampoo and I am incredibly happy to report that I did not have any dandruff that whole trip or even as much of an itchy scalp when I got back!!!</li>
            <li>I have used it every other day as suggested and I am flake free!  </li>
            <li>and I have used many other brands OTC including prescribed ones.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I felt confident this was what I needed.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair, better than any other.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feel better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I compared it to another product Pura d&#x27;or I purchased for a lot more money and this one works, the other one did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, in comparison to the other products I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s the closest to a natural/organic-ish shampoo that I&#x27;ve gotten which makes me feel better about what&#x27;s coming in contact with my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Like most of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen here</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo not only to be great against dandruff, but better at nourishing my hair than the other JASON shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>others felt it didn&#x27;t clean well enough.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, neither of us could bring ourselves to use it long enough to see if it had any therapeutic effect</li>
            <li>It actually smells more herbal and natural than all other strong chemical products.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes from this product as per the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have had dandruff for close to two decades and thought it was something that could only be cured with a special prescription shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to find a solution but none of the products available in stores worked for long.</li>
            <li>works to keep my scalp clear; I started by using 2-3 times a week for first three weeks</li>
            <li>I would probably have been willing to stick with the shampoo just for it&#x27;s natural aspects except for the fact that ever since I started using it, any sterling silver necklaces and earrings that I wear become oxidized.</li>
            <li>With the first use, the flakes on my scalp had cleared up considerably and the itch was gone.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other shampoos I&#x27;ve used for dandruff!</li>
            <li>Some other shampoos have helped a LITTLE, but most do nothing and many</li>
            <li>The smell isnt really that strong...definitely not as strong as Selson or that other tar based one, Denorex or whatever its called.  </li>
            <li>I could live with the medicinal smell if it left my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>but now I want sulfate free and this one has greatly improved o have psoriasis or bad dandruff or both it helps</li>
            <li>Nothing worked - they are all filled with alcohol and dry out your scalp.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my worst flare ups now are better than my best days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does seem to work decent.</li>
            <li>When I use it daily it keeps these things under control and (for me anyway) actually works better.</li>
            <li>When the bottle came, I noticed that the bottle looked different and sure enough, they seemed to have updated the design and maybe formula of the shampoo as well?  </li>
            <li>But the main thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my itchy scalp..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it gave a real deep cleaning which I need because I do get mild dandruff sometimes.</li>
            <li>and i only have mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong sulfur/medicinal odor, but is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed since many others had such great results with this product, but I guess it can&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying this again and highly recommend it to all...</li>
            <li>However, after drying my hair, it smelled like a combination of a junior high locker room and sulfur.  </li>
            <li>Like the title to this review says, \\&quot;Highly Recommended.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend this product, even if you aren&#x27;t having dandruff problems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Something I&#x27;ve been plagued with since high school.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The regular use of my Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo felt great and stopped the burning itch... until my hair/scalp was dry and no longer wet from washing and then - voila,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other kind of dandruff shampoo and would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it had more natural products than other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have since completely stopped the use of this product looking at other companies for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And a simple solution is to use a pretty smelling conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I prove a lot of products along all my life, but this is the ONLY ONE CAN KILLS DANDRUFF hehehehe really!!</li>
            <li>Now they are completely spotless!!  </li>
            <li>It may have helped a little, but for me the thing that helps the most is a Apple Cider Vinegar and water concoction.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting - not too medicated and a little herby.</li>
            <li>During the dry season my scalp tends to become very itchy resulting in a mild case of dandruff.</li>
            <li>This product would be perfect for me if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, that didn&#x27;t make me happy.</li>
            <li>I had also bought one of those scalp master brushes in order to help clear any existing buildup on my scalp and improve circulation, so I used that for the whole 3 minutes the shampoo was sitting in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this shampoo because it is natural and it did seem to clear up some scalp problems at first.</li>
            <li>It smells borderline medicinal, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and now think of the smell as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, definitely worth the benefits of a moral product that helps my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different brands and different things to control and clear away my dandruff.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my hair normal, not all</li>
            <li>Smells like you cracked open a freshly toasted pumpkin seed</li>
            <li>if you have normal dandruff issues that come and go, by pass this product and use whatever works for you and does not smell.  </li>
            <li>i will update this post after a few more uses regarding my experience with flaking, rashes, scabbing etc.</li>
            <li>after using my normal conditioner, i dont smell the shampoo at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like using shampoo because it breaks off my hair</li>
            <li>The first day of using Jason the dandruff  was considerably less, second day even more dandruff gone and within a week all dandruff gone.</li>
            <li>Jason&#x27;s as it has less additives and is more natural.  </li>
            <li>which has different ingredients and makes the shampoo less effective.</li>
            <li>No matter how often he washed his hair, the smell would come right back.</li>
            <li>right after I apply this at my roots, I also put deep conditioner on my ends.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it does have a very strong smell, but I think it is a small price to pay for a natural dandruff shampoo that delivers results.</li>
            <li>received the new bottle I ordered &amp;</li>
            <li>The bottle states \\&quot;new look/</li>
            <li>Neither Tea Tree Oil or Neem are in the new version of the product.</li>
            <li>I no longer smell like sulfur, I did have to buy a new hair brush (no idea if the smell faded or not on</li>
            <li>which is also a new nicety.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t used this new bottle without the label yet....</li>
            <li>well it is but its the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>The odor is much less noticeable than a head full of flakes!</li>
            <li>but my scalp is looking like it is getting more pink than red.</li>
            <li>I called my dermatologist to get an appointment because I was fed up, only to be told that their next appointment wasn&#x27;t available for over 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>i will update my post after a few more uses as far as effectiveness is concerned.</li>
            <li>Now the parts of my scalp that you can see aren&#x27;t pink or red, and my hair has more lift and volume to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not less flaking, it&#x27;s not just a little better...</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all the positive reviews and searching high and low for a product that was both natural/SLS-free and could help my dandruff.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other more well known brands, this one actually works.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dandruff issues and started using the Nizo$o4@L and got rid of it in a few days but then came back with more intense itching while still using it...</li>
            <li>but they sent me the original one...without rosemary and other things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 9 months and I have no more flakes.</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo didn&#x27;t bother me when I first tried it, and I&#x27;ve actually found that I&#x27;ve come to like it.</li>
            <li>This is the second one that I tried (after the first was ineffective) and just finished off the bottle.</li>
            <li>In general, I really like JASON products-</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something natural to help with his itchy scalp and dandruff and he likes it!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff that actually worked.</li>
            <li>I have had psoriasis on my scalp for almost 10 years and this is the first thing that I have used that has gotten rid of the itch and the big scabby flakes!</li>
            <li>the first time i discovered this i couldn&#x27;t breath because it was so gross.</li>
            <li>She used this for the first time and i noticed a big difference with just one use.</li>
            <li>After ONE use, my first, my problems were gone, entirely.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t work for anyone, but in my own personal case it didn&#x27;t so much as make a dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got through a good bit of the bottle and felt really underwhelmed, since other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried had at least shown SOME effect by then.</li>
            <li>I am down to very little smell which is nice!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a small price to pay for such amazing results.  </li>
            <li>This product works VERY well on my long, brown, straight hair -</li>
            <li>I have pretty marked seborheric dermatitis, and I have never-chemically-processed African hair.  </li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t brush my hair after a shower the shampoo creates strong, firm curls.</li>
            <li>Seems like the older positive reviews are for an older formulation of this, as tea tree oil is no longer an ingredient and the sulfur smell is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Very thick shampoo, soaps up nicely, leaves hair soft and conditioned And!</li>
            <li>It is typical with most dandruff shampoos that the focus is on the scalp but doesn&#x27;t necessarily help the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li>#34;a blue gel used to clean the toilet.&amp;#34; in my opinion, yes, it smells sort of like toilet cleaner.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo just once or twice and discovered my face felt amazingly smooth and refreshed and tight all day.  </li>
            <li>Even though I wash my hair everyday, I still had a smelly scalp, my hair smelled fine, but my scalp stunk.</li>
            <li>The reviewer above is right in saying that the smell is not the greatest... but its not the worst either and Iam definitely willing to put up with it</li>
            <li>Doesnt leave your scalp feeling tight and uncomfortable like most dandruff shampoos and it is HIGHLY effective.</li>
            <li>My hair looks strong, healthy and very thick, just the way it was before I had issues with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Selsun &amp; other products were wayy to strong for someone like me (who has a case of occasional dandruff), this one works!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and I dont have to worry about wearing black at all.</li>
            <li>helps clear my scalp.</li>
            <li>Also leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Works but just be informed that you are buying a sulfur based natural Shampoo</li>
            <li>I decided to go natural</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother us much because 1) his hair is short &amp; 2)</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have spend hundreds</li>
            <li>Some people say it will work the same day, but for me it really took 2 weeks to start working.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT use this product on your face, though unless you have naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>And no, I don&#x27;t work for Lush, and they&#x27;re not paying me to endorse their products.</li>
            <li>I had been trying every over-the-counter product there is, and we just couldn&#x27;t get the bugs to go away completely and STAY gone.</li>
            <li>went to a natural health food store to see if I could find something there to help.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm and we so far haven&#x27;t had any recurring lice</li>
            <li>I cannot really spread it as it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather up, so I take some in my hand and just put it on my scalp and comb through my hair with my fingers still on my scalp to try to get every bit of my head covered.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 uses of every-other-day washing to get my scalp completely itch-</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness goes, this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>I have uber sensitive skin, and it does not make me itch....</li>
            <li>B000FGDIAS JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces]]</li>
            <li>There have been some studies on hormone problems with it for young boys.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant after reading the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>I find the use of my conditioner tends to make my scalp itchier than when I just cut it out or use the all natural tea tree oil spray conditioner.</li>
            <li>Since then my dandruff problem has been completely licked.  </li>
            <li>You Jason guys should really market this as a facial product.</li>
            <li>so I tried all natural \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Natural is misleading - check out the toxicity rating for this product by the Environmetnal Working Group:</li>
            <li>In combination with Neem oil, I finally have a real solution to an embarrassing hairline issue.</li>
            <li>so I tried Jason natural dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, and my 7 year old daughter started itching her scalp and was diagnosed with sebhorrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>cleaned my hair but did not help with intense scaling that came suddenly out of nowhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now trying a hybrid approach where I&#x27;m conditioning all the hair except for my direct scalp.  </li>
            <li>for background, I am 34 years old, and have had severe dandruff since I was in 4th grade or so.  </li>
            <li>This stuff fixed my dandruff overnight.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to use much when you wash your hair, so the bottle will last longer than you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a natural shampoo for dandruff relief.</li>
            <li>I have had Psoriasis of the scalp since I was a young child</li>
            <li>The scent is not heavy</li>
            <li>I am so thankful to have found a product that finally offers me comfort.</li>
            <li>As I said, it smells like someone&#x27;s moldy, old basement</li>
            <li>The apple cider vinegar worked well for me, but was such a pain to apply and really stunk up my hair.  </li>
            <li>He still rotates in the old shampoos but so far it&#x27;s held up for 3 months now.  </li>
            <li>Also leaves haie soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>and I like the natural product no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>A lot of people suggest that women with natural hair should cowash since shampoos strip your hair of moisture and natural oils.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been natural for three).</li>
            <li>I tried the trader joes tea tree line, as well as natural cleansers, apple cider vinegar, you name it.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used natural shampoos before</li>
            <li>as far as effectiveness is concerned, this remains to be seen.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are all natural</li>
            <li>I used this one time so far, ONE.  </li>
            <li>Together with Jason&#x27;s natural biotin conditioner, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li>which only something like T-gel did temporarily, Head and Shoulders never seemed to really help.</li>
            <li>I am 31 yrs old and he is 9 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>im 29 yrs old..</li>
            <li>I bought to have something natural to use for myself and my girls</li>
            <li>but it dosen&#x27;t cure it completely.</li>
            <li>We decided he should test out- JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces-</li>
            <li>If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d probably chalk up the extra $13 and just buy Regenepure again because at least the smell is nice and minty.</li>
            <li>At times I felt like it was helping my dry and itchy scalp, but most of the time I did not see any long term solution besides the initial soothing comfort.</li>
            <li>I have been using it this way for the past year and a half with good results.</li>
            <li>Hands down this product works &amp; leaves my scalp feeling a little tingly (which I love!)  </li>
            <li>On top of that, my pink scalp doesn&#x27;t make it stick out anymore since it isn&#x27;t pink!</li>
            <li>Well, I was a little worried about the smell since my husband loves to smell my clean hair.</li>
            <li>Personally I thought this would have a very strong tea tree potency, or at least a lot of neem oil.   </li>
            <li>The fast action dandruff control ingredients work quickly to manage flakey and itchy scalp, while additional ingredients work hard all day to keep you smelling like farts, even in the toughest conditions.</li>
            <li>then why would you want to clean your hair with uber harsh industrial strength detergents?</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first wash, and by the second or third my scalp dryness was no longer an issue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but it actually works.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to shampoo pretty regularly, because it will get greasy after a day or two.  </li>
            <li>so a lot of the other reviews were right about the bottle advertised is not the bottle you will receive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also, my scalp has been very itchy and dry and wanted to find a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only Con is,this is not available easily over the counter,but has to be shipped online</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the sulfur smell goes away, you can alternate between this shampoo and your normal (or other special shampoo, ie for oily hair, or for color treated hair, or for dry hair, or whatever else you normally use.)  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every single penny, especially if you need immediate and long-lasting relief.</li>
            <li>I found this product and decided that the ingredients should get his scalp back to normal.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue most of life, both had always left a burnt hair smell after my hair dried</li>
            <li>As others have noted, it does have a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and reminds me of salons I went to when I was much younger (though I&#x27;m certain those salons were relying rather heavily on synthetic fragrances!).</li>
            <li>I believe I have just found my new  (and only) shampoo!!  </li>
            <li>I bought a new bottle last week and when I opened the package, there wasn&#x27;t a label on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I left it on for a few minutes and it was tingly and my hair came out clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my (aging) mother whose scalp was flaking so much that she would not wash her hair, believing that her scalp was dry from washing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well for dry hair.</li>
            <li>The only shampoo that stop my dandruff, well not actually stopped but almost reduced it to nothing, very recommended shampoo.</li>
            <li>This makes it one of the most expensive bottles of shampoo I ever purchased, when I consider how much it will cost to replace the necklace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a bit thick in consistency, but overall ok.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how to use this product: Every other day at first, and then 1-2 times a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li>It is pretty persistent, and never responded to other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of fake bath and body works types of chemical fragrances, (some of us actually find that stuff very offensive!)</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo every day for the first week and now use it every other.  </li>
            <li>Also if you have never used this shampoo before, I suggest using it every other day for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This resolved my issue with dandruff when no other product would.</li>
            <li>I actually went for a haircut last Saturday and for the first time in a couple of years I saw no white spots/flakes coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure what it is in this that does that (if anyone knows, I would be grateful if you commented, so I can steer clear of it for next time), but I pretty much have to polish my silver jewelry every time I wear it if I want it to be shiny...</li>
            <li>I had the same experience as the first reviewer - all flaking from seborrhoeic dermatitis disappeared after a single use.</li>
            <li>This shampoo got rid of the problem on the first wash; I have NEVER had that with any other shampoo or natural remedy (such as vinegar).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like shampoos that don&#x27;t have SLS in them because they are difficult to lather and don&#x27;t get your hair clean, but this stuff is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with dermatitis in the winter my whole life, but this year was the first time that it affected my scalp in a way that made it hard to deal with and quite embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Jason always makes great products but this dandruff shampoo makes your hair smell bad after use</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, which I&#x27;d say is generally the case with just about any product, but I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using a shampoo with pyrithione zinc, alternating it with DHS Clear and doing a vinegar rinse 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li>The doctor said it may take several weeks for my ears to clear up.</li>
            <li>However, this shampoo, while I&#x27;m not using it for my hair seems to radically clear up the acne on my back.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it has a slightly unusual smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long.</li>
            <li>By far this is the only shampoo that works for me to get rid of the dandruff.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo so far that has worked with my dandruff problem.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised how even 1/3 of the amount of your regular shampoo (in my case, H&amp;S) is like 10x foamier than JASON.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo barely lathers and it did not get rid of my flakes at all.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinse, my wet hair feels sticky.  </li>
            <li>Natural has been the only thing that has kept my dandruff in control.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor if you want to go the natural root and just add a drop of tea tree oil in your regular shampoo and leave in for just a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I tried some home remedies, but nothing seemed to have a lasting effect, so I went looking for a natural shampoo solution.</li>
            <li>We have tried several natural dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>is the ONLY dandruff shampoo I have ever tried that has COMPLETELY CURED my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients and the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found to keep my head from itching.</li>
            <li>The problem continued and in many cases, I feel that it got worse.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells any better or worse than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would NOT suggest using this shampoo more than 2-3 times a week as you may end up irritating your scalp.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but the delivery was disappointing.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product for anyone who&#x27;s dealt with this embarrassing problem for as long as they can remember!</li>
            <li>I used a little more than they suggest due to thick medium length hair in order to get full scalp coverage, I also comb it through like when I condition it.</li>
            <li>It is strong, no doubt about that, what I do is use it every other day at the beginning, and progressively less, up to once a week to maintain.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month and a half flakes and itching have very much improved.</li>
            <li>BUT if you&#x27;re looking for a product with the ingredients I listed above, you will be left wanting as the new Jason product no longer includes these ingredients and</li>
            <li>If the smell is really that big of a problem, then you probably should just continue having the dry, itchy, flaky, embarrassing scalp...</li>
            <li>Since I already color my hair and use heat on it for styling, I wanted a gentle shampoo for take care of my dry scalp and overall health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>After reading several forums and contemplating purchasing a very expensive product, I saw some people talk about how this shampoo had been very effective.  </li>
            <li>I have mild dandruff (for the last 20 odd years!)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smell bad all day but is very effective.</li>
            <li>I developed seborrheic dermatitis behind my right ear and a small patch on the left, top side of my head.  </li>
            <li>I had the worse case of burning/itchiness and depending on how much I sweated during the recent heat waves, I had buildup and plaque (which of course scratchy fingers that they are now accustomed scratched off) , but it is back to a very, very mild and privately manageable level.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not how someone should live dealing with a dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean 5+ minutes, after about 3 you can just barely feel the cool tea tree feeling, barely.  </li>
            <li>I found the JASON dandruff shampoo, and it had  all of the active ingredients in it that the lice kit did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo much like you would a lice treatment, leaving it on for about 10 minutes, washing it out, and combing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sulfur-y (an active ingredient).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has worked well on my natural 4A-4B African American hair</li>
            <li>and especially when i just get out of the shower its the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i will buy another bottle after this one runs out, unless they bring the old formula back.</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;m not someone who washes their hair every day so not sure if that&#x27;s necessary for full effectiveness?</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed my hair felt heavier and a little oily, but I wanted to give myself a chance to get used to it.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair smell like a hot springs, it did dissipate a little with the conditioner i used.</li>
            <li>It is not safe for pregnant women to use, and because of that, I don&#x27;t really want to use it even when not pregnant.</li>
            <li>Hair Type Information: Brown (dyed Red), Wavy, Fine Hair Strands, Thick Amount of Hair, Oily Bangs/Roots, Moderate Dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So after about two weeks of use we&#x27;ve noticed that the dandruff problem has improved dramatically (much like if we had used a conventional dandruff shampoo).</li>
            <li>As soon as my scalp dried after these treatments, it went right back to fiery burning please-rip-the-skin-off-so-it-won&#x27;t-burn-and-itch-no-more supreme discomfort.  </li>
            <li>This worked okay for me; but the value is poor compared to Sage shampoo which did the same thing for me; but required much less product to produce as much lather.</li>
            <li>Really was not worth it.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at our local health food store, but we recently moved far from any such store, so here I am ordering it online.</li>
            <li>Prior to the exacerbation from the color treatments, my scalp (especially the hairline near my forehead) would be visibly flake-y and would occasionally fall off onto my shoulders and desk by itself or when I rubbed my forehead.  </li>
            <li>This is a big bummer, since I really felt like that was one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, this product did weigh my hair down and the smell lingered on throughout the whole day and for these reasons, I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li>I wanted something without sulfates because my hair has always been frizzy when grown long in the past, but it was hard to find something like that &amp; good for my scalp at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a less toxic product, but this is not friendly to my fine blond hair.</li>
            <li>A little history abt my problem:  I typically use Head &amp; Shoulders Ocean Lift or Refresh as I suffer from frequent dandruff and mild scalp itchiness.</li>
            <li>- Apply said all natural product whose scent is on par with that of Selsum Blue, but with significant less foaming/sudsing (image using 3 times the dollop size you typically use with your regular commercialized shampoo)  - Said all natural product alleviate and eliminated color-treated scalp condition and improved condition equal to and above pre-color treated scalp condition; however, did not completely eliminate (but did alleviate) peripheral conditions as a result of scalp condition.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t at all harsh like the other chemical filled commercial products.  </li>
            <li>read the reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I previously bought a Maple Holistics Lavender and Almond Oil shampoo that did absolutely nothing for my head.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>Started by using it everyday and i am now on the second bottle in 3 month (bought the first one in Feb)s and have reduced it to 3X per week.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I asked my primary care physician what could be done to alleviate the feeling and useless doctor that they were diagnosed it as seborrheic dermatitis and said there really isn&#x27;t any remedy other than frequent cleaning and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo, but ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair has been a greasy mess, even when I use it without conditioner.</li>
            <li>[plaque is the medical term], lightly pus/moistened (like it felt slick &amp; wet but didn&#x27;t feel oily, and smelled like pus) and smelled infected.     </li>
            <li>After those days are up, you can use Jason&#x27;s Shampoo 1 time every 3 days and your normal shampoo the other times.  </li>
            <li>But if I do that, it will dry my scalp more and make the flaking worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially when you use the shampoo its fragrance kind of covers the nasty sulfury smell, but those with a strong sense of smell can still smell it.</li>
            <li>I had tried several anti-dandruff shampoos previously, and none of them really worked; this got rid of all my dandruff after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>My hair became a tangled and weighed down greasy mess that I had to wash my hair that same night with my regular shampoo to get it clean.</li>
            <li>The benefits (little or no dandruff) outweigh the problems with using a product laden with very toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>this will smell a little strange to you at first.</li>

            <li> lol..</li>
            <li> Great Dandruff Shampoo</li>
            <li> GREAT product, can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> and my head is still doing great.</li>
            <li> A great product&lt;</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> but my course curly hair looks and feels better than it has since I was a kid!!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the oily</li>
            <li> Sulphur is know to be very effective in helping with scalp problems, but the smell is the price to pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective at treating my dandruff while being just a pleasant and soothing product.  </li>
            <li> But, oh my goodness it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This helped in one use, beyond amazing with 2 uses!</li>
            <li> I find that this shampoo is a wonderful addition to my regimen for maintaining a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo for the price for sure.</li>
            <li> But worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong sulfurous odor!  </li>
            <li> It is good, takes away the dandruff after a couple of washed.</li>
            <li> so, i bought this product because it got fairly good reviews</li>
            <li> I find that this product works good.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I find that as good as it is</li>
            <li> Good smelling conditioner helps to combat the shampoos odor.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> My skin prefers a good 15 minute treatment in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great and effective alternative to the coal tar and selenic?</li>
            <li> all of the oils in it are so good for you.</li>
            <li> so i suggest u buy a good scented conditioner to go with this preferably by jason</li>
            <li> Good for people like me with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> There is still a bit of dandruff here and there, but not like there used to be (brush and braid her hair nightly, so I get a chance to take a good look).</li>
            <li> that being said, it does feel good on the scalp,</li>
            <li> do this for a good 30 seconds or so</li>
            <li> if you use a washcloth or loofah, rinse it out really good when you are done, with the shampoo in your hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to use a good amount</li>
            <li> Nothing over the counter seemed to do him any good.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend a good conditioner as this shampoo severely dries out the hair.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of stopping the iching and flaking, gets ride of oil and scalp odor as well.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found what I needed with Jason&#x27;s &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;, since the reviews were so good, but no luck.</li>
            <li> Jason has worked well and leaves hair looking good.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo would be good for those who wash their hair every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved the product, for I felt it was helping with my dandruff problem</li>
            <li> And as embarrassing as it sounds, this doesn&#x27;t happen because you don&#x27;t take good care of your hair.</li>
            <li> helps with the dandruff issue fairly well.</li>
            <li> Good Diet and exercise also help in keeping away dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and will continue purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is awesome and is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I have this stuff.</li>
            <li> the scent is so lovely that when the bottle arrived at my work place,&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed some on just to smell it!  </li>
            <li> I love Jason&#x27;s shampoos!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I doubt I can repair any of that now, but I feel much better about myself and have even stopped checking for flakes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I love that product, helped a lot with scalp itchiness !</li>
            <li> and I feel confident that my scalp has improved!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> After so many years of having dandruff, this shampoo was a miracle!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things and this has done wonders!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant, but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li> I guess that bothers some people; I find it pleasant and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> it is very good product , despite its strong smell :)</li>
            <li> It works fine and was a great price.</li>
            <li> It works great and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> but it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt a burning sensation, and i liked it and kept massaging it all over..</li>
            <li> My husband likes it too--he always tells me I smell nice after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own but make me, my shower, and my bath towels, STINK.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice in shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it works really good.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while because it is effective for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> what anyone was talking about when it came to just how effective this was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an effective dandruff-control shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp for years.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results are excellent, both my daughter and I are showing much improved signs, and not scratching even close to what we used to.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the name of (the one that has some kind of anti-fungal agent).  </li>
            <li> The smell is more earthy but still good.</li>
            <li> It works well on dandruff as well as making the room smell nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sulfur or the rosemary, but after years of trying product after product (even the nice sulfate-free ones), this has been my saving</li>
            <li> but I kind of like the sulfur smell.  </li>
            <li> I find that I really like Neutrogena T-Gel the best of all the brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own).  </li>
            <li> Before you wash with it, it has a nice herbal aroma.</li>
            <li> so I am glad that amazon sells it at a good price.</li>
            <li> Effective formula, no flakes.</li>
            <li> Then I tried working a solution of coconut oil melted in warm water into my scalp, and rubbing apple cider vinegar into my scalp, but those attempts didn&#x27;t solve my problem, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not understand how this product has gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus I liked the tingling feeling when I&#x27;d leave it on for 3 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> it has a burning scent, but the both of us agree it is worth it!!!    </li>
            <li> I am so excited and relieved to have found this product!!</li>
            <li> so be sure to grab a generous amount of shampoo and really massage it into your scalp for the best results.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong smell that tends to linger so be prepared.</li>
            <li> But thing is, this has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all it has a very STRONG smell.</li>
            <li> i do not usually write reviews but havent been so impressed with a product as i am with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was the best one by far!  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it has a nice smell to it on its own, and on top of that it is all natural - awesome!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dandruff treatment I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Best natural shampoo I found for dandruff</li>
            <li> My SLS free tea tree shampoo, also by JASON, does just as much good as this stuff.    </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt; JASON dandruff shampoo is by far the best thing I have ever put on my head.</li>
            <li> healthy which trust me is an amazing feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that&#x27;s the ingredient that makes it effective.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong sulfur smell!</li>
            <li> Great Natural product smells good too</li>
            <li> Smells great and really works!</li>
            <li> Flakes are greatly reduced after first use</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works really well!  </li>
            <li> The ingredients seem good, the scent is not bad, the price is alright, but the performence is not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I like this product as well, but it does smell kind of strong.</li>
            <li> silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very bummed because my scalp was better (once I got over the smell) but it ruined a beautiful goldplated necklace my husband gave me for Mother&#x27;s Day one year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with 4b hair and this shampoo has allowed me to be dandruff free for up to 2 weeks after shampooing, versus having dandruff the day after washing for most of my life!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to leave it in for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The breakouts have stopped and my scalp and hair feel much better.</li>
            <li> Love the cooling feeling on my scalp</li>
            <li> I had to do something to preserve the sexy.  </li>
            <li> After one use,  I noticed that the flaking was drastically better.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more.  </li>
            <li> OK, I have had some kinda dandruff/dry scalp thing going on for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully worth some good karma</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll be buying more of this product after all.</li>
            <li> I think the smell bothered me more than anything, it&#x27;s a mix of smokiness and chemical.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 1.5 months just to be sure</li>
            <li> and I love the products.</li>
            <li> Better if you use it with another shampoo .</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was that most of the OTC products were burning my daughter&#x27;s skin, not to mention what they were doing to her</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not up to the skipping more than a day of use, yet.</li>
            <li> Most reviews made this sound amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well and it works much better then all the acne products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I think the stuff might work if it didn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, but it does, and that has ALWAYS exacerbated my condition much more than help it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> It is concentrated so I get more for my dollar.</li>
            <li> Also,due to the Neem Oil in it, I was able to use it to treat my daughter,with eczema for lice.</li>
            <li> I did some research and know that herbal products work so well for so many things and decided to try the JASON Dandruff Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think the Tea Tree and Rosemary come through more than the Sulfer smell.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars (can I add 1 more?)...</li>
            <li> However, as others have already remarked on, the smell can be overpowering, especially first thing in the morning (which is when I shower).  </li>
            <li> and I could feel a fiery burn where there was the most dandruff and itchiness.</li>
            <li> and I find I haveto use more than a quarter-sized dollop to get it spread/suds up my scalp &amp; hair)</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> After that you can start using it once every week like me and it does a perfect job of preventing the dandruff itch from coming back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, I will keep using it since I have it but probably will keep looking for a better shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It has made this most noticeable difference in my dandruff epidemic and I am truly grateful.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a bottle of this magic shampoo when she noticed my &amp;#34;str-excema&amp;#34; (stress induced scalp insanity)...</li>
            <li> The price is better than brands in a store, too.</li>
            <li> The scent of it is just okay too.  </li>
            <li> Now that she&#x27;s a tween, it bothers her more than it used to.</li>
            <li> I took two more showers after using this today and I still can&#x27;t get the stink off.</li>
            <li> One thing I find interesting is there&#x27;s no ingredients list on the bottle, and no directions either.  </li>
            <li> but I think it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars mostly because of what it&#x27;s done for my scalp so it delivers on that as advertised.</li>
            <li> Shampoos &amp; creams can make it feel better for awhile. .  </li>
            <li> But I am having better luck with the natural/ organic products.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s consistency was much more like conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> but you can use as needed for more severe cases.</li>
            <li> so hopefully it even works better with time.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from severe burning and itching scalp for years also and have not been able to find any help.</li>
            <li> This shampoo popped up to the top of my search results.  </li>
            <li> the results were even better.  </li>
            <li> There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than being itchy and/or flakey.</li>
            <li> This worked better for my beard than Beard Oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped leave my hair softer and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all have done nothing but cause more of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Also my hair feels healthy after using it.</li>
            <li> My son said that he felt it worked better if he let the shampoo sit on his scalp for 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I do wish the fragrance was better though...</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair so more foam makes me feel like I&#x27;ve done a better job washing each strand.</li>
            <li> it is a better I used in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders worked okay for a while, but we wanted something a bit better.</li>
            <li> Provided much better relief than Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this most days for over a week now leaving on for 5-6 minutes each time, in hopes of relieving itching and scabby bumps.</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his scalp and it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> used for more than 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Infact I have not been able to find this for a while and stumbled on it by accident.  </li>
            <li> Needed an alternative to dandruff shampoos that have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is used in most of the well known brands to create foam.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Really works great and doesn&#x27;t harm my hair.</li>
            <li> After researching more about my problem, I believe I am in the &amp;#34;smelly hair syndrome&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does seem to get better as you continue to use it so don&#x27;t give up after just one use.</li>
            <li> and they said it wasn&#x27;t so that made me feel better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell too</li>
            <li> I love Rosemary and Olive</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> glad I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product it contained no sulfates but another derivative, which I felt would be okay at the time.</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to find a cure.</li>
            <li> I have used all famous shampoos, though they gave relief when I used them, there was nothing permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a magical product and I wonder why I did not find this thing two years ago.</li>
            <li> The itchiness, the dryness and even most of the flakiness were gone almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Both she and dad love the way their hair feels and looks, it adds body and shine.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this shampoo - it&#x27;s more creamy like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY dandruff shampoos over the years.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair healthy, and minimizes frizz.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Head and shoulders work much better than this shampoo anyday.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better then</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t touched the  steroids in many months.</li>
            <li> I rarely check my scalp anymore, just once in awhile to make sure all is good.</li>
            <li> , i just wish that it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my girlfriend bought this for me</li>
            <li> I have agreed to give it up because I don&#x27;t think it is doing any better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it did what I needed plus gives my hair anature shine, this I will get again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on my way to a clean and healthy scalp!</li>
            <li> it smells kind of minty and clean, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I feel my scalp is very clean now and</li>
            <li> The cool tingling sensation that built up over time was relaxing and amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the new formula with no tea tree oil and it works great.</li>
            <li> It works well, but dry out the hair a bit so best if followed by some conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but not horrible in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works good smells good enough.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and non toxic, and also it gives great results.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too medicinal (more herbal) and when compared to the Neutrogena tar-like product, its light years better.</li>
            <li> Squeeky &amp;lt;sp&gt; clean!</li>
            <li> This stuff does a fantastic job of controlling my psoriasis/dandruff while also keeping my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok at keeping it flake free in the winter.</li>
            <li> , my issues though, centered more around a burning and itching scalp than dandruff (which was an issue as well, just not my primary concern).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think this gets rid of dandruff, but it helps make your scalp feel good.  </li>
            <li> I mix the shampoo with another, more pleasant smelling natural shampoo, to lessen this effect.</li>
            <li> This has had the greatest positive effect by far.</li>
            <li> I am more than excited about this product</li>
            <li> He uses it every other day, as it does get greasy, and its great!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not bad at all!</li>
            <li> Does have a medicinal smell from the sulfur but my hair products covered it up easily.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like I need to use another shampoo on top of it to truly get it clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong when combating the problem.  </li>
            <li> So far so good this product :-)</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but I use a scented conditioner so it doesn&#x27;t smell once my hair is styled.</li>
            <li> The sulfur smell is strong but who cares.</li>
            <li> the downside, it does smell strongly of something that reminds me of eucalyptus or menthol.</li>
            <li> The smell to me is not that strong .</li>
            <li> Not to mention when you workout or sweat the smell comes out so strong people around you can smell it and let me tell you...</li>
            <li> Strong smell, but</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a strong odor, comparable to coal-tar shampoos, but I don&#x27;t mind because it gets rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li> It must be some strong stuff because even if I use another shampoo afterwards the smell remains in my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and natural on its own.</li>
            <li> Cudos to Jason and their dedication to put out high quality products at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in that it&#x27;s natural and works AMAZINGLY to get rid of dandruff/psoriasis!</li>
            <li> It leaves your scalp feeling refreshed and cool and smelling much better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> You can air yourself out some, but in any enclosed space, you will smell kind of funny.</li>
            <li> Though the first fragrant layer of this shampoo is nice and herbally my husband</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true, my scalp is better.</li>
            <li> I use topix benzoyl peroxide with aloe vera for my face and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> As a side note, my lowlights are fine (brunette)</li>
            <li> very impressed I&#x27;ve had scalp issues all life and previously just rotated products</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> It washes out just fine, lathers well too.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Jason was the first dandruff shampoo we tried and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> and it controls my dandruff just fine</li>
            <li> My son is allergic to a certain chemical found in most dandruff type shampoos and prescription shampoo had many side effects</li>
            <li> The huge DANDRUFF display on the bottle doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> I believe that has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the prettiest for shampoo, but it&#x27;s way easier for me to deal with than huge chunks of flakes all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> the huge downside is the sulfur..</li>
            <li> Works great, I only use it once a week</li>
            <li> same great formula\\</li>
            <li> and flake- free.</li>
            <li> It is important to remember to leave the shampoo in your hair for about 2 minutes before rinsing it out to let it do its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I went back and read those reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall great product</li>
            <li> I dont use it everyday but it has been working great!</li>
            <li> I always use sulfate free shampoos/conditioners but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> I need a sulfate free shampoo because of a the infusium hair treatment (like a keratin treatment) which I had done.</li>
            <li> Compared to Head and shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but I will keep using it until I find a sulfate free shampoo with Zinc in it.</li>
            <li> am now 100% flake free because of this product</li>
            <li> and I hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li> Use this product 2-3 X per week and have been dandruff free for years.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> and it keeps my scalp flake and crust free.</li>
            <li> My scalp condition has improved greatly over the last year</li>
            <li> While in the process of shampooing my hair, I did enjoy the sensation and smell.</li>
            <li> One child is scab/flake free already.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to hop on the anti-artificial scent band wagon or if you enjoy earthy smells, then you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the smell is really medicated and kind of reminds me of a retirement home smell.</li>
            <li> So, now the search is on for a natural shampoo that keeps my curls looking good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and my jewelry oxidized.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as good as the conditioner and dandruff shampoo in one.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, used it 2 times so far, seems to be helping the dandruff, still have some flakes</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Out of all the dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used and tested, this is by far the most effective ...</li>
            <li> (That price is cheap and very worth it by the way.)  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad but so strong .</li>
            <li> Not bad, but strong.</li>
            <li> I have prob tried everything from home made remedies (which are very useful), to Flax oil, to ignoring it, to this.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it since he liked it, but it has a very strong smell and because I only wash my hair twice/week, the smell lingered for days!  </li>
            <li> On the side note, it does leave your hair feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The shampoo helps to prevent skin dryness and irritation, but it has very strong and unusual smell, maybe these are oils...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can dry your hair out the way all dandruff shampoos can so just make sure you have a good conditioner to apply to your hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> :) It might smell funny, but it works.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shampoo in an effort to get rid of head lice.</li>
            <li> Not artificial!</li>
            <li> Worth trying!  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, I suffer from Seb Dermatitis and this has completely eliminated my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Okay, at first I had no idea</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this shampoo to treat my itchy scalp+dandruff after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find a natural shampoo for my issue.  </li>
            <li> You probably need to make sure this stuff covers ALL of your hair until the smell goes away the first time.  </li>
            <li> but it is not a repulsive smell but just a unique smell.</li>
            <li> Cheap, simple, and so far works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I tried many products and nothing seemed to consistently do the job.</li>
            <li> So, great shampoo for men (or those with short hair), but not the best for us ladies with long hair and sensitive noses!</li>
            <li> after emailing both the seller and Amazon, I still don&#x27;t know if they still make the original formula, nor if anything will be done about the misleading advertising...</li>
            <li> it is worth your time and money to try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> but it did significantly reduce my dandruff post pregnancy.</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed like it made it better.</li>
            <li> but it does clean well.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to all of the harsh chemicals in most shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel clean.  </li>
            <li> my hair stays clean longer.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s free of many not-so-good ingredients, and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li> I also pair this with an anti-residue shampoo once a week to really clean and remove all the gunk from my hair, including the sulfur in the Jason Dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does clean my hair well and no conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li> Was very worried about the effects of that strong shampoo on my hair and was looking for something more natural but effective.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair really clean</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great in controlling dry scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li> I had to clean it up, and I lost a substantial amount of product -</li>
            <li> just love this stuff, and am still in a state of disbelief over the fact that my scalp is healthy and completely flake-free.  </li>
            <li> Found Jason and its been about 2 years,it has been keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li> My scalp is clear and healthy!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is mild relative to most, and extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried sulphur shampoos before but there must be something special about the combination of ingredients in the Jason shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> It started working right away!  </li>
            <li> and I could go up to three days without having to use the shampoo before my scalp got a little bit itchy which has been incredibly liberating.</li>
            <li> After each wash, I feel my scalp is not itchy any more and pretty fresh.</li>
            <li> This may be great for some, but please be careful.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> He tried it &amp; has had such good results.  </li>
            <li> I should mention, we tried Selsun Blue, T-Gel &amp; good ol&#x27; Head &amp; Shoulders before buying this and nothing worked until this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the dandruff go away forever, but it keeps it pretty under control, and it&#x27;s a natural product, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product about six months ago because my scalp was in good condition after regular use of Jason&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I also use nice conditioners like Coolaulin from Lush and MOP Leave-</li>
            <li> Is also a good regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fixing my scalp and making me and my home and all around me better and happier.    </li>
            <li> We used Netrogena T-Gel, and that smell is much more pungent and would make our whole upstairs</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this instead of the 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that I love so much.</li>
            <li> Oh sweet Jesus.</li>
            <li> Just remember to leave The Jason shampoo on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure that it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I thought initially that it is a good thing - those smelly dandruff fighting agents.</li>
            <li> Overall really good dandruff shampoo that cleans well and stops flakes/scalp odor</li>
            <li> Because of all the good reviews on this product I decided to try it for my moderate to severe dandruff.</li>
            <li> It took nothing to rinse it out with cool water, as well.  </li>
            <li> so there is a pretty strong sulfur smell that lingers for a day.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what to do because the large flakes of skin and soreness, in addition to the itching were not making me an attractive female.  </li>
            <li> I did not next best thing in the entire world.  </li>
            <li> But, since using Jason, my dandruff hasn&#x27;t returned, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw, and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade away as quickly at all.     </li>
            <li> I use many herbal products and love shampoos that are herbal and essential oil based anyway.</li>
            <li> As I got older, I started coloring my hair more to cover my premature grays.</li>
            <li> This is not to say this product is a miracle shampoo; I still have some mild itchiness at the places</li>
            <li> I received in quick time just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has always had mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is nice to finally not have to worry about all those huge flakes.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of scalp dermititis</li>
            <li> So if your head is super itchy from the flakes</li>
            <li> one&#x27;s smell is fairly mild.</li>
            <li> You will quickly notice a difference when you treat your scalp well.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this shampoo I have NEVER, NEVER been able to go more than three days without washing my hair, now I can go 4-5.  </li>
            <li> I got more again, and sure enough, it went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a mild soapy smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pungent odor and the way it leaves hair looking super greasy is intolerable.</li>
            <li> Quick Summary:&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> but I still love it for the fact that it leaves my hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li> right now, my scalp feels soothed and clean.</li>
            <li> I tried all other brands of dandruff shampoo and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products I have tried, this shampoo is perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, all natural, but has a very strong smell which I&#x27;m not sure if everyone is ok with it.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice much of any smell, which people claim is incredibly strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li> even as a woman, I really like the smell, as it&#x27;s not too floral, but rather has a strong herbal scent (medicinal to some).</li>
            <li> I just spray some hairspray on when it&#x27;s dry and that takes away a good amount of it.   </li>
            <li> Just be ready for a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting the problem for many years - very sensitive skin, so any changes in water/hair care/stress level would impact my scalp immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i use aubrey primrose every other day and that is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Highly recomend it!!!</li>
            <li> After the first application, the itchiness on my scalp was gone!</li>
            <li> My own personal experience of dry scalp and white flaky dandruff is best solved by the H2O and ACV.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that combats psoriasis, eczema and dandruff without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has it been AMAZING for my dandruff</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks the condition of my scalp improved greatly using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything that is available at Wal-Mart and a product from the doctor and none of it really worked.</li>
            <li> I have have been so happy I found my self crying sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well considering it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this and the odor was a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li> The old version without the rosemary etc. was better.</li>
            <li> I am dandruft free after so many years of trying different products.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job as far as that went...</li>
            <li> Hair is soft after, love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Overall it was kind of a hit or miss affair with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Since having my second baby, my hair has been kind of out of whack.</li>
            <li> In my efforts to move towards more natural products, I found this shampoo, read the reviews, and decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> Natural dandruff shampoo that is safe for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> That sounds like fun.</li>
            <li> After all isn&#x27;t a couple of years of growing your hair out worth getting rid of flakes forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil does have a distinct smell but nothing compared to a tar based product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a more natural way to take care of dandruff.</li>
            <li> not looked at all the ingredients too closely but know that most of them are Natural.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> The dandruff is under far better control.</li>
            <li> It only kind of worked for me.</li>
            <li> well worth it for what it does.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> an added benefit, the recurring pink spots with scaly skin on top that I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for years have mostly cleared up, and I think my hair looks healthier than at any time I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a couple all-natural-esque products for dandruff and dry scalp and this by far has shown the best results, highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> That being said I don&#x27;t mind it too much though I usually use a conditioner after the fact just to add a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was full of tea tree oil, neem oil, and without sudsing agents, which just dry you out anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other shampoos and conditioner but most do not work that</li>
            <li> and I take super hot showers</li>
            <li> Also, it has a very distinct smell that isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, and I&#x27;m usually a fan of earthy scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The odor from this product is a distinct Sulfur Odor, is VERY strong, WILL make your clothes, hairbrush, even fingers smell like sulfur, even 2 days after you last washed your hair!  </li>
            <li> you can put up with the smell of sulphur, then this would be a good product for controlling dandruff and other scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Works good in any other season, But</li>
            <li> As always I was right and the shampoo did wonders on my hair</li>
            <li> It worked right away.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is intentional, after all people buy patchouli on purpose, right?</li>
            <li> That is right, I said \\&quot;GOES</li>
            <li> I am on week 3 right now, and have not had ANY problems.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and &#x27;real&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised Jason made my scalp feel &amp; look better when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because as a practicing &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; I needed a sulfate free dandruff shampoo that would treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> At first it feels like it is not lathering well, but if you keep at it, and then rinse and repeat, the second application lathers up really nicely.  </li>
            <li> it does have an odd pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> For a little better scent I simply use a good light conditioner and that takes care of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I can combat any slight lingering sulfur smell by rinsing really well with some distilled water and using a great smelling coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming smell, works great.</li>
            <li> I am proud to say that after 29 yrs my scalp is over 80 % better after only a few uses..</li>
            <li> Leaves your scalp feeling super soothed and is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin &amp; sometimes get mild dandruff (on days when I don&#x27;t sleep as much as I should)  </li>
            <li> Amazing results after a single</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit intense, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Without good conditioner, it&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the smell of this product is VERY intense.</li>
            <li> no problems //  very fast service</li>
            <li> First of all, it has a very comfortable fragrance taste; secondly, remove dandruff effect</li>
            <li> So I was thinking OMG, great, now which of the million products on the market will truly clean (without over-stripping) and moisturize my poor scalp??  </li>
            <li> In fact, I strayed last week and used a product that I thought would be better.  </li>
            <li> I did some research via Google &amp; many others with this same problem</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, the shampoo seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smelled funny.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty off-putting though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos since then.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and within the first week of use, the itching has gone away on my head</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Not any better than selsun blue.  </li>
            <li> The smell is like a lot of chemical-free beauty products, and smells like essential oils, most noticeably, tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks washing everyother day, my scalp is feeling so much calmer!</li>
            <li> Besides, the shampoo really works so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> ; heck, since there&#x27;s not even the slightest irritation, there really isn&#x27;t even that anymore!    </li>
            <li> I see no dandruff for the first couple days and just a fleck here and there afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but the benefits of my facial skin was even better.  </li>
            <li> This was the first dandruff shampoo I ever tried.</li>
            <li> I scrolled up and sure enough, the Amazon directions stated this.</li>
            <li> They are affordable and work really well!</li>
            <li> I admired the smell out of the bottle when we first got this.</li>
            <li> This thing worked for me since the first use.</li>
            <li> Different shampoos might work for different people but this one was definitely for me and my condition and so just wanted to thank the makers of this awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo and it worked so fast!</li>
            <li> I used it for a week to make sure, but it didn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li> okay, so i have come to the very specific description of the &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; i have mentioned:</li>
            <li> This shampoo got rid of all my dandruff after the first go.</li>
            <li> Takes the itching and dermititis away but your hair will really smell like sulfur; worth it if you want to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> This worked the even after the first wash.</li>
            <li> note, the bacteria will come back, see the directions below for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had flaky dandruff, but I&#x27;ve had a constantly itchy, irritated scalp for many years.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dandruff</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first JASON product I&#x27;d used</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to control my dandruff better than products like Head and Shoulders that don&#x27;t contain the antifungal properties of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never failed my scalp.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;ve been buying products for years and years on Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to leave a review on a product.  </li>
            <li> First off, it smells to me exactly like Tums or Pepto Bismol...</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it actually works better than Sebulex.  </li>
            <li> Etching was gone the first time.</li>
            <li> It fades away after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is so much like rotten eggs/sulfur that it gave me a headache!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this shampoo twice in a row, make sure you use another regular shampoo to wash this one out before you apply it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this exact product.</li>
            <li> Three washes and it was already evident that it was doing its job.</li>
            <li> It is VERY drying!</li>
            <li> I make sure to deep condition after every wash because of it.</li>
            <li> it has evidently changed since they first offered it..</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> i just received this bottle of shampoo and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> the bottle i received has sort of a &amp;#34;cleaning product&amp;#34; smell, my first association was that of &amp;</li>
            <li> When I switched to Jason, the first thing I noticed was the burnt smell was gone</li>
            <li> Man, my scalp was really messed up!</li>
            <li> I tried jason first.. and let me tell you..</li>
            <li> and it started working from the first.</li>
            <li> I guess I was willing to go through anything to get rid of the dandruffs.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I could not stand the smell...</li>
            <li> The one real downside with this shampoo is that it weighs my hair down a good deal.</li>
            <li> ( if you use Jason on Sat for example , use the other shampoo on Tues ) because some kind of dandruff require changing between 2 kinds of shampoo and changing the order of using them .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now BEWARE , if you style your hair with a flat iron , hair dryer, or curler the smell transforms into the most foul smell ever.</li>
            <li> I tried many shampoos from popular drugstore brands to expensive organic ones, each using different active ingredients to solve the problem (tea tree, aloe, etc) and this one with sulfur as the main ingredient had the best results.</li>
            <li> I am not joking, or kidding, nor is it that amusing, actually kind of scary.  </li>
            <li> With the conditioner on at the same time, my ends come out nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more gentle on my dyed hair than Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li> Most of my life my hair has been healthy, thick and dark-brownish.</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, which is to be expected as it has sulfur in it.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly thanks to Amazon prime and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t want to spend too much (previously bought Regenepure DR, pretty effective but</li>
            <li> so a strong smell from a natural product doesn&#x27;t normally get to me...</li>
            <li> So at the end of my wits and literally scratching my head as to what would stop the itch, I tried Jason shampoo after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> i enjoyed using it, it lathered well for me and the smell was decent and clean smelling compared to a lot of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> The main smell that you&#x27;ll notice right away is like Pepto Bismol.  </li>
            <li> I have gone very natural with my hair and have only washed with water for the last ten months, but dandruff was getting the best of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every scalp treatment I can get my paws on.</li>
            <li> ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give the product 5 stars, but I want to see long term how this helps...</li>
            <li> But add to that the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really lather well, and for me, even though I used it for a couple weeks going exactly by directions, it did not work on dandruff.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase as long as its available!</li>
            <li> She and dad love it, and mom is washing her hair again ( a minor miracle).</li>
            <li> Over the span of 18-24 months of monthly/every touch ups and semi-annual full color treatments, my dandruff gradually went from sometimes to frequently to incessant.</li>
            <li> It did turn a sterling silver ring of mine a kind of dark color probably because of the ingredients</li>
            <li> I make sure to rinse my hair thoroughly before using a second, better smelling shampoo (I like Trichomania solid shampoo and Curly Wurly shampoo from Lush).</li>
            <li> Not my favorite look, but I&#x27;ve gotten into a rhythm of using this 1-2x/week and sometimes following with my regular shampoo and conditioner combo, which keeps my scalp healthy and my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural product to use in place of T-Gel for my mild psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> stuff certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that off-putting sulfur smell that i was bracing myself for.</li>
            <li> i cant wait to see what it looks like in a few more washed!</li>
            <li> I wanted something without a high chemical content and have liked other Jason products.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the smell is fine</li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong as other dandruff shampoos (though it does have a distinct scent, it is not unpleasant like other shampoos we&#x27;ve tried), and she noticed a significant difference after the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, smells good in bottle and while you apply.</li>
            <li> As other rewiers pointed out, this particular Jason shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve ever found this amazing was a very specific Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo that cost me 30 dollars years ago, and I haven&#x27;t found it since.</li>
            <li> This not only helps combat the problem, the combo of oils helps moisturize which is important to acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> Over time, the sulphur smell doesn&#x27;t linger as much on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I waited until I had used the whole bottle before writing a review.</li>
            <li> and I really think that everyone who is suffering with some type of dandruff condition needs to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my husband who has very oily skin &amp; scalp.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so it can really soak in ...</li>
            <li> $25 is too much for shampoo.)</li>
            <li> I cant speak for how much it relieves dandruff.</li>
            <li> thanks for delivering fast ^_^</li>
            <li> I have even gone through phases of putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp...</li>
            <li> It really is a scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li> The combination works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo it cured my itchy scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> While this seemed to be working for a while, it isn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is a real blessing.  </li>
            <li> (as JASON is very low-suds</li>
            <li> You can continue activating it to get deeper skin tightening and peels and really stretch its use.  </li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t really notice a smell, though.</li>
            <li> , this dandruff controller really helped i saw results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery with this company.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell feels very unclean to me.  </li>
            <li> also, i find i do not have to wash as much ...</li>
            <li> She started using Head &amp; Shoulders, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> It seems like this shampoo is really healing the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I had a VERY itchy scalp before buying this.</li>
            <li> Nothing really clears up scalp psoriasis .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been prescribed steroid foams and creams, and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much stronger than that</li>
            <li> Yes, I think it really works well.</li>
            <li> I really like Jason products, body wash etc.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing + smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, I will give the seller that.</li>
            <li> but if you really need to get rid of flakes don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My husband has very severe dandruff</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is the combination of herbal oils in the product.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> I can skip a day without much effect too</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts longer than you might expect.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in how my hair looked and how my scalp felt.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for my son&#x27;s scalp.  </li>
            <li> and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do too much to help my husbands itchiness.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and tingles when I let it sit on my scalp (around 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> it does not seem to have done much for my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked very well.</li>
            <li> The smell is very herbal (Rosemary, Olive, Jojoba)</li>
            <li> which means I really need to take care of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m flakes free, Totally recommending this product!</li>
            <li> BUT it doesn&#x27;t do too much for my dandruff.</li>
            <li> product came up when I searched sulfate free shampoo, but that is obviously not the case.</li>
            <li> Our dandruff was still there just not as much before shampooing.  </li>
            <li> and I heard her say \\&quot;What kind of sham...</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use more natural products such as soaps and skincare products.  </li>
            <li> searching Amazon showed me this Jason Natural Dandruff Relief Shampoo... and been more than 6 months now with no dandruff, using it once a week only as maintenance</li>
            <li> I too have spent so much money on Salon products - which would help for a day at most.  </li>
            <li> The best test of all is my dark pillows which in the past after a nights sleep would be covered in flakes.  </li>
            <li> I used this Jason Dandruff Shampoo a few times, but I found it not too effective.</li>
            <li> I recently read that coal-tar is a carcinogen and decided to switch to a more natural option since the t-gel wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  </li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like these highly commercialized shampoos, which I could care less about anyways.</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough to not burn and the minty smell is harsh at first but becomes pleasant to start the day with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers--if you&#x27;re a guy with short hair, this will be a great product because your hair won&#x27;t be near your nose.  </li>
            <li> I took a 5-day trip this past week without bringing this shampoo and I am incredibly happy to report that I did not have any dandruff that whole trip or even as much of an itchy scalp when I got back!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it every other day as suggested and I am flake free!  </li>
            <li> and I have used many other brands OTC including prescribed ones.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I felt confident this was what I needed.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair, better than any other.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feel better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I compared it to another product Pura d&#x27;or I purchased for a lot more money and this one works, the other one did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, in comparison to the other products I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s the closest to a natural/organic-ish shampoo that I&#x27;ve gotten which makes me feel better about what&#x27;s coming in contact with my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen here</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo not only to be great against dandruff, but better at nourishing my hair than the other JASON shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> others felt it didn&#x27;t clean well enough.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, neither of us could bring ourselves to use it long enough to see if it had any therapeutic effect</li>
            <li> It actually smells more herbal and natural than all other strong chemical products.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes from this product as per the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff for close to two decades and thought it was something that could only be cured with a special prescription shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had to find a solution but none of the products available in stores worked for long.</li>
            <li> works to keep my scalp clear; I started by using 2-3 times a week for first three weeks</li>
            <li> I would probably have been willing to stick with the shampoo just for it&#x27;s natural aspects except for the fact that ever since I started using it, any sterling silver necklaces and earrings that I wear become oxidized.</li>
            <li> With the first use, the flakes on my scalp had cleared up considerably and the itch was gone.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other shampoos I&#x27;ve used for dandruff!</li>
            <li> Some other shampoos have helped a LITTLE, but most do nothing and many</li>
            <li> The smell isnt really that strong...definitely not as strong as Selson or that other tar based one, Denorex or whatever its called.  </li>
            <li> I could live with the medicinal smell if it left my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> but now I want sulfate free and this one has greatly improved o have psoriasis or bad dandruff or both it helps</li>
            <li> Nothing worked - they are all filled with alcohol and dry out your scalp.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my worst flare ups now are better than my best days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does seem to work decent.</li>
            <li> When I use it daily it keeps these things under control and (for me anyway) actually works better.</li>
            <li> When the bottle came, I noticed that the bottle looked different and sure enough, they seemed to have updated the design and maybe formula of the shampoo as well?  </li>
            <li> But the main thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my itchy scalp..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it gave a real deep cleaning which I need because I do get mild dandruff sometimes.</li>
            <li> and i only have mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong sulfur/medicinal odor, but is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed since many others had such great results with this product, but I guess it can&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying this again and highly recommend it to all...</li>
            <li> However, after drying my hair, it smelled like a combination of a junior high locker room and sulfur.  </li>
            <li> Like the title to this review says, \\&quot;Highly Recommended.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend this product, even if you aren&#x27;t having dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Something I&#x27;ve been plagued with since high school.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The regular use of my Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo felt great and stopped the burning itch... until my hair/scalp was dry and no longer wet from washing and then - voila,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other kind of dandruff shampoo and would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it had more natural products than other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have since completely stopped the use of this product looking at other companies for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a simple solution is to use a pretty smelling conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I prove a lot of products along all my life, but this is the ONLY ONE CAN KILLS DANDRUFF hehehehe really!!</li>
            <li> Now they are completely spotless!!  </li>
            <li> It may have helped a little, but for me the thing that helps the most is a Apple Cider Vinegar and water concoction.</li>
            <li> The smell is interesting - not too medicated and a little herby.</li>
            <li> During the dry season my scalp tends to become very itchy resulting in a mild case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> This product would be perfect for me if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, that didn&#x27;t make me happy.</li>
            <li> I had also bought one of those scalp master brushes in order to help clear any existing buildup on my scalp and improve circulation, so I used that for the whole 3 minutes the shampoo was sitting in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this shampoo because it is natural and it did seem to clear up some scalp problems at first.</li>
            <li> It smells borderline medicinal, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and now think of the smell as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, definitely worth the benefits of a moral product that helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands and different things to control and clear away my dandruff.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my hair normal, not all</li>
            <li> Smells like you cracked open a freshly toasted pumpkin seed</li>
            <li> if you have normal dandruff issues that come and go, by pass this product and use whatever works for you and does not smell.  </li>
            <li> i will update this post after a few more uses regarding my experience with flaking, rashes, scabbing etc.</li>
            <li> after using my normal conditioner, i dont smell the shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like using shampoo because it breaks off my hair</li>
            <li> The first day of using Jason the dandruff  was considerably less, second day even more dandruff gone and within a week all dandruff gone.</li>
            <li> Jason&#x27;s as it has less additives and is more natural.  </li>
            <li> which has different ingredients and makes the shampoo less effective.</li>
            <li> No matter how often he washed his hair, the smell would come right back.</li>
            <li> right after I apply this at my roots, I also put deep conditioner on my ends.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it does have a very strong smell, but I think it is a small price to pay for a natural dandruff shampoo that delivers results.</li>
            <li> received the new bottle I ordered &amp;</li>
            <li> The bottle states \\&quot;new look/</li>
            <li> Neither Tea Tree Oil or Neem are in the new version of the product.</li>
            <li> I no longer smell like sulfur, I did have to buy a new hair brush (no idea if the smell faded or not on</li>
            <li> which is also a new nicety.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t used this new bottle without the label yet....</li>
            <li> well it is but its the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> The odor is much less noticeable than a head full of flakes!</li>
            <li> but my scalp is looking like it is getting more pink than red.</li>
            <li> I called my dermatologist to get an appointment because I was fed up, only to be told that their next appointment wasn&#x27;t available for over 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> i will update my post after a few more uses as far as effectiveness is concerned.</li>
            <li> Now the parts of my scalp that you can see aren&#x27;t pink or red, and my hair has more lift and volume to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not less flaking, it&#x27;s not just a little better...</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the positive reviews and searching high and low for a product that was both natural/SLS-free and could help my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other more well known brands, this one actually works.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dandruff issues and started using the Nizo$o4@L and got rid of it in a few days but then came back with more intense itching while still using it...</li>
            <li> but they sent me the original one...without rosemary and other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 9 months and I have no more flakes.</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo didn&#x27;t bother me when I first tried it, and I&#x27;ve actually found that I&#x27;ve come to like it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one that I tried (after the first was ineffective) and just finished off the bottle.</li>
            <li> In general, I really like JASON products-</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something natural to help with his itchy scalp and dandruff and he likes it!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis on my scalp for almost 10 years and this is the first thing that I have used that has gotten rid of the itch and the big scabby flakes!</li>
            <li> the first time i discovered this i couldn&#x27;t breath because it was so gross.</li>
            <li> She used this for the first time and i noticed a big difference with just one use.</li>
            <li> After ONE use, my first, my problems were gone, entirely.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t work for anyone, but in my own personal case it didn&#x27;t so much as make a dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got through a good bit of the bottle and felt really underwhelmed, since other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried had at least shown SOME effect by then.</li>
            <li> I am down to very little smell which is nice!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a small price to pay for such amazing results.  </li>
            <li> This product works VERY well on my long, brown, straight hair -</li>
            <li> I have pretty marked seborheric dermatitis, and I have never-chemically-processed African hair.  </li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t brush my hair after a shower the shampoo creates strong, firm curls.</li>
            <li> Seems like the older positive reviews are for an older formulation of this, as tea tree oil is no longer an ingredient and the sulfur smell is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very thick shampoo, soaps up nicely, leaves hair soft and conditioned And!</li>
            <li> It is typical with most dandruff shampoos that the focus is on the scalp but doesn&#x27;t necessarily help the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> #34;a blue gel used to clean the toilet.&amp;#34; in my opinion, yes, it smells sort of like toilet cleaner.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo just once or twice and discovered my face felt amazingly smooth and refreshed and tight all day.  </li>
            <li> Even though I wash my hair everyday, I still had a smelly scalp, my hair smelled fine, but my scalp stunk.</li>
            <li> The reviewer above is right in saying that the smell is not the greatest... but its not the worst either and Iam definitely willing to put up with it</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave your scalp feeling tight and uncomfortable like most dandruff shampoos and it is HIGHLY effective.</li>
            <li> My hair looks strong, healthy and very thick, just the way it was before I had issues with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Selsun &amp; other products were wayy to strong for someone like me (who has a case of occasional dandruff), this one works!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and I dont have to worry about wearing black at all.</li>
            <li> helps clear my scalp.</li>
            <li> Also leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Works but just be informed that you are buying a sulfur based natural Shampoo</li>
            <li> I decided to go natural</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother us much because 1) his hair is short &amp; 2)</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have spend hundreds</li>
            <li> Some people say it will work the same day, but for me it really took 2 weeks to start working.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT use this product on your face, though unless you have naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> And no, I don&#x27;t work for Lush, and they&#x27;re not paying me to endorse their products.</li>
            <li> I had been trying every over-the-counter product there is, and we just couldn&#x27;t get the bugs to go away completely and STAY gone.</li>
            <li> went to a natural health food store to see if I could find something there to help.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm and we so far haven&#x27;t had any recurring lice</li>
            <li> I cannot really spread it as it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather up, so I take some in my hand and just put it on my scalp and comb through my hair with my fingers still on my scalp to try to get every bit of my head covered.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 uses of every-other-day washing to get my scalp completely itch-</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness goes, this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin, and it does not make me itch....</li>
            <li> B000FGDIAS JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> There have been some studies on hormone problems with it for young boys.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant after reading the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I find the use of my conditioner tends to make my scalp itchier than when I just cut it out or use the all natural tea tree oil spray conditioner.</li>
            <li> Since then my dandruff problem has been completely licked.  </li>
            <li> You Jason guys should really market this as a facial product.</li>
            <li> so I tried all natural \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Natural is misleading - check out the toxicity rating for this product by the Environmetnal Working Group:</li>
            <li> In combination with Neem oil, I finally have a real solution to an embarrassing hairline issue.</li>
            <li> so I tried Jason natural dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and my 7 year old daughter started itching her scalp and was diagnosed with sebhorrheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> cleaned my hair but did not help with intense scaling that came suddenly out of nowhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now trying a hybrid approach where I&#x27;m conditioning all the hair except for my direct scalp.  </li>
            <li> for background, I am 34 years old, and have had severe dandruff since I was in 4th grade or so.  </li>
            <li> This stuff fixed my dandruff overnight.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to use much when you wash your hair, so the bottle will last longer than you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a natural shampoo for dandruff relief.</li>
            <li> I have had Psoriasis of the scalp since I was a young child</li>
            <li> The scent is not heavy</li>
            <li> I am so thankful to have found a product that finally offers me comfort.</li>
            <li> As I said, it smells like someone&#x27;s moldy, old basement</li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar worked well for me, but was such a pain to apply and really stunk up my hair.  </li>
            <li> He still rotates in the old shampoos but so far it&#x27;s held up for 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> Also leaves haie soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> and I like the natural product no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> A lot of people suggest that women with natural hair should cowash since shampoos strip your hair of moisture and natural oils.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been natural for three).</li>
            <li> I tried the trader joes tea tree line, as well as natural cleansers, apple cider vinegar, you name it.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used natural shampoos before</li>
            <li> as far as effectiveness is concerned, this remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are all natural</li>
            <li> I used this one time so far, ONE.  </li>
            <li> Together with Jason&#x27;s natural biotin conditioner, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> which only something like T-gel did temporarily, Head and Shoulders never seemed to really help.</li>
            <li> I am 31 yrs old and he is 9 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> im 29 yrs old..</li>
            <li> I bought to have something natural to use for myself and my girls</li>
            <li> but it dosen&#x27;t cure it completely.</li>
            <li> We decided he should test out- JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces-</li>
            <li> If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d probably chalk up the extra $13 and just buy Regenepure again because at least the smell is nice and minty.</li>
            <li> At times I felt like it was helping my dry and itchy scalp, but most of the time I did not see any long term solution besides the initial soothing comfort.</li>
            <li> I have been using it this way for the past year and a half with good results.</li>
            <li> Hands down this product works &amp; leaves my scalp feeling a little tingly (which I love!)  </li>
            <li> On top of that, my pink scalp doesn&#x27;t make it stick out anymore since it isn&#x27;t pink!</li>
            <li> Well, I was a little worried about the smell since my husband loves to smell my clean hair.</li>
            <li> Personally I thought this would have a very strong tea tree potency, or at least a lot of neem oil.   </li>
            <li> The fast action dandruff control ingredients work quickly to manage flakey and itchy scalp, while additional ingredients work hard all day to keep you smelling like farts, even in the toughest conditions.</li>
            <li> then why would you want to clean your hair with uber harsh industrial strength detergents?</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first wash, and by the second or third my scalp dryness was no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you have to shampoo pretty regularly, because it will get greasy after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> so a lot of the other reviews were right about the bottle advertised is not the bottle you will receive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp has been very itchy and dry and wanted to find a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only Con is,this is not available easily over the counter,but has to be shipped online</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the sulfur smell goes away, you can alternate between this shampoo and your normal (or other special shampoo, ie for oily hair, or for color treated hair, or for dry hair, or whatever else you normally use.)  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every single penny, especially if you need immediate and long-lasting relief.</li>
            <li> I found this product and decided that the ingredients should get his scalp back to normal.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue most of life, both had always left a burnt hair smell after my hair dried</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it does have a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and reminds me of salons I went to when I was much younger (though I&#x27;m certain those salons were relying rather heavily on synthetic fragrances!).</li>
            <li> I believe I have just found my new  (and only) shampoo!!  </li>
            <li> I bought a new bottle last week and when I opened the package, there wasn&#x27;t a label on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a few minutes and it was tingly and my hair came out clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my (aging) mother whose scalp was flaking so much that she would not wash her hair, believing that her scalp was dry from washing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that stop my dandruff, well not actually stopped but almost reduced it to nothing, very recommended shampoo.</li>
            <li> This makes it one of the most expensive bottles of shampoo I ever purchased, when I consider how much it will cost to replace the necklace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a bit thick in consistency, but overall ok.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how to use this product: Every other day at first, and then 1-2 times a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> It is pretty persistent, and never responded to other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of fake bath and body works types of chemical fragrances, (some of us actually find that stuff very offensive!)</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo every day for the first week and now use it every other.  </li>
            <li> Also if you have never used this shampoo before, I suggest using it every other day for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This resolved my issue with dandruff when no other product would.</li>
            <li> I actually went for a haircut last Saturday and for the first time in a couple of years I saw no white spots/flakes coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is in this that does that (if anyone knows, I would be grateful if you commented, so I can steer clear of it for next time), but I pretty much have to polish my silver jewelry every time I wear it if I want it to be shiny...</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as the first reviewer - all flaking from seborrhoeic dermatitis disappeared after a single use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo got rid of the problem on the first wash; I have NEVER had that with any other shampoo or natural remedy (such as vinegar).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like shampoos that don&#x27;t have SLS in them because they are difficult to lather and don&#x27;t get your hair clean, but this stuff is really amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with dermatitis in the winter my whole life, but this year was the first time that it affected my scalp in a way that made it hard to deal with and quite embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Jason always makes great products but this dandruff shampoo makes your hair smell bad after use</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It may not work for everyone, which I&#x27;d say is generally the case with just about any product, but I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using a shampoo with pyrithione zinc, alternating it with DHS Clear and doing a vinegar rinse 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> The doctor said it may take several weeks for my ears to clear up.</li>
            <li> However, this shampoo, while I&#x27;m not using it for my hair seems to radically clear up the acne on my back.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it has a slightly unusual smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long.</li>
            <li> By far this is the only shampoo that works for me to get rid of the dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo so far that has worked with my dandruff problem.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised how even 1/3 of the amount of your regular shampoo (in my case, H&amp;S) is like 10x foamier than JASON.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo barely lathers and it did not get rid of my flakes at all.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinse, my wet hair feels sticky.  </li>
            <li> Natural has been the only thing that has kept my dandruff in control.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor if you want to go the natural root and just add a drop of tea tree oil in your regular shampoo and leave in for just a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I tried some home remedies, but nothing seemed to have a lasting effect, so I went looking for a natural shampoo solution.</li>
            <li> We have tried several natural dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> is the ONLY dandruff shampoo I have ever tried that has COMPLETELY CURED my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients and the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found to keep my head from itching.</li>
            <li> The problem continued and in many cases, I feel that it got worse.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells any better or worse than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would NOT suggest using this shampoo more than 2-3 times a week as you may end up irritating your scalp.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the delivery was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It works ok, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product for anyone who&#x27;s dealt with this embarrassing problem for as long as they can remember!</li>
            <li> I used a little more than they suggest due to thick medium length hair in order to get full scalp coverage, I also comb it through like when I condition it.</li>
            <li> It is strong, no doubt about that, what I do is use it every other day at the beginning, and progressively less, up to once a week to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half flakes and itching have very much improved.</li>
            <li> BUT if you&#x27;re looking for a product with the ingredients I listed above, you will be left wanting as the new Jason product no longer includes these ingredients and</li>
            <li> If the smell is really that big of a problem, then you probably should just continue having the dry, itchy, flaky, embarrassing scalp...</li>
            <li> Since I already color my hair and use heat on it for styling, I wanted a gentle shampoo for take care of my dry scalp and overall health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading several forums and contemplating purchasing a very expensive product, I saw some people talk about how this shampoo had been very effective.  </li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff (for the last 20 odd years!)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell bad all day but is very effective.</li>
            <li> I developed seborrheic dermatitis behind my right ear and a small patch on the left, top side of my head.  </li>
            <li> I had the worse case of burning/itchiness and depending on how much I sweated during the recent heat waves, I had buildup and plaque (which of course scratchy fingers that they are now accustomed scratched off) , but it is back to a very, very mild and privately manageable level.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not how someone should live dealing with a dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean 5+ minutes, after about 3 you can just barely feel the cool tea tree feeling, barely.  </li>
            <li> I found the JASON dandruff shampoo, and it had  all of the active ingredients in it that the lice kit did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo much like you would a lice treatment, leaving it on for about 10 minutes, washing it out, and combing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sulfur-y (an active ingredient).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has worked well on my natural 4A-4B African American hair</li>
            <li> and especially when i just get out of the shower its the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i will buy another bottle after this one runs out, unless they bring the old formula back.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m not someone who washes their hair every day so not sure if that&#x27;s necessary for full effectiveness?</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed my hair felt heavier and a little oily, but I wanted to give myself a chance to get used to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair smell like a hot springs, it did dissipate a little with the conditioner i used.</li>
            <li> It is not safe for pregnant women to use, and because of that, I don&#x27;t really want to use it even when not pregnant.</li>
            <li> Hair Type Information: Brown (dyed Red), Wavy, Fine Hair Strands, Thick Amount of Hair, Oily Bangs/Roots, Moderate Dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So after about two weeks of use we&#x27;ve noticed that the dandruff problem has improved dramatically (much like if we had used a conventional dandruff shampoo).</li>
            <li> As soon as my scalp dried after these treatments, it went right back to fiery burning please-rip-the-skin-off-so-it-won&#x27;t-burn-and-itch-no-more supreme discomfort.  </li>
            <li> This worked okay for me; but the value is poor compared to Sage shampoo which did the same thing for me; but required much less product to produce as much lather.</li>
            <li> Really was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at our local health food store, but we recently moved far from any such store, so here I am ordering it online.</li>
            <li> Prior to the exacerbation from the color treatments, my scalp (especially the hairline near my forehead) would be visibly flake-y and would occasionally fall off onto my shoulders and desk by itself or when I rubbed my forehead.  </li>
            <li> This is a big bummer, since I really felt like that was one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> However, this product did weigh my hair down and the smell lingered on throughout the whole day and for these reasons, I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted something without sulfates because my hair has always been frizzy when grown long in the past, but it was hard to find something like that &amp; good for my scalp at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a less toxic product, but this is not friendly to my fine blond hair.</li>
            <li> A little history abt my problem:  I typically use Head &amp; Shoulders Ocean Lift or Refresh as I suffer from frequent dandruff and mild scalp itchiness.</li>
            <li> - Apply said all natural product whose scent is on par with that of Selsum Blue, but with significant less foaming/sudsing (image using 3 times the dollop size you typically use with your regular commercialized shampoo)  - Said all natural product alleviate and eliminated color-treated scalp condition and improved condition equal to and above pre-color treated scalp condition; however, did not completely eliminate (but did alleviate) peripheral conditions as a result of scalp condition.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all harsh like the other chemical filled commercial products.  </li>
            <li> read the reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I previously bought a Maple Holistics Lavender and Almond Oil shampoo that did absolutely nothing for my head.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Started by using it everyday and i am now on the second bottle in 3 month (bought the first one in Feb)s and have reduced it to 3X per week.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I asked my primary care physician what could be done to alleviate the feeling and useless doctor that they were diagnosed it as seborrheic dermatitis and said there really isn&#x27;t any remedy other than frequent cleaning and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, but ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair has been a greasy mess, even when I use it without conditioner.</li>
            <li> [plaque is the medical term], lightly pus/moistened (like it felt slick &amp; wet but didn&#x27;t feel oily, and smelled like pus) and smelled infected.     </li>
            <li> After those days are up, you can use Jason&#x27;s Shampoo 1 time every 3 days and your normal shampoo the other times.  </li>
            <li> But if I do that, it will dry my scalp more and make the flaking worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially when you use the shampoo its fragrance kind of covers the nasty sulfury smell, but those with a strong sense of smell can still smell it.</li>
            <li> I had tried several anti-dandruff shampoos previously, and none of them really worked; this got rid of all my dandruff after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> My hair became a tangled and weighed down greasy mess that I had to wash my hair that same night with my regular shampoo to get it clean.</li>
            <li> The benefits (little or no dandruff) outweigh the problems with using a product laden with very toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> this will smell a little strange to you at first.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other stuff and it only lessoned the dandruff but with this stuff the dandruff is completely gone within a month.</li>
            <li> I love the way the shampoo makes my hair feel and behave, and it has not removed any of my color, but the smell is really hard to get past and it last for days.</li>
            <li> some flakes were the size of two side by side benadryl pills or slightly larger, on up to pieces the size of a small lima bean, I&#x27;m not talking pepper flake sized, or grain of sand, these were large sections of my scalp flaking off.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo does smell a little err different than what you would normally expect but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> dandruff treatments require daily use (haha if you have my type of hair)and aree very harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it when, after a week, my scalp was flake-free for the first time in my LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had red, dry, scaley scalp that was always itchy - spring, summer, fall, and especially winter time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a a black woman with coarse natural hair.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that I need to write this review, because of all the confusing reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Some have commented on the smell, but that is a small inconveinience for someone that really has a dandruff problem that needs addressed.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they chose to use salicylic acid as it has a very drying effect.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed my hair had too much buildup and started itching a lot during the past year</li>
            <li> Use it for at least a month straight to see results!</li>
            <li> long story short - it just works !</li>
            <li> and I have used Selsen Blue for a long time...</li>
            <li> I have straight, long hair and it does dry out my ends a little, so</li>
            <li> i have very long thick hair which sometimes waves at the ends but is mostly just straight, thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> My conditioner is all natural and helps tone the fire and brimstone smell down a bit.    </li>
            <li> Within the first few tries of using it, my scalp became extremely dry and built up clusters of dandruff on my head.</li>
            <li> I have done a few other things to help my dandruff such as washing my hair only a few times a week as well as using cool water to try to help with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I may have even gotten an allergic reaction because I developed bumps and the dry itchy scalp has now spread to the other side.</li>
            <li> Finding JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo [Rosemary, Neem, Tea Tree 12oz]:  Desperately searching the market for a natural shampoo with sulfur (which something about hair color treatments strip from your head), tea-tree or other natural recommended moisturizing oils, and other wholesome goodness (because I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with the products from Sally&#x27;s, Walmart, Target, Whole Foods), I stumbled upon Jason Natural Costemics Dandruff Relief Shampoo on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My kids and I both get really dry scalp in the winter and regular dandruff shampoos were not working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry scalp my entire life.</li>
            <li> Not only is my dry scalp gone</li>
            <li> Then let it dry 10-15 minutes and then rub in some water again for a second activation.  </li>
            <li> and my scalp was starting to get dry and flakey again.</li>
            <li> The upside is, as one reviewer said, after one shampoo, the scaliness was far less severe.  </li>
            <li> IT suds well and doesn&#x27;t strip dry african hair.  </li>
            <li> Especially during winters get bouts of dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and slightly aromatic.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry scalp issues on and off my entire life..</li>
            <li> It smells like toilet bowl cleaner and you can smell it for days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And a few weeks later, my dandruff began to clear</li>
            <li> If you do not wash your hair every day, add a no washday in there (change every other to 1 out of 3 days, and change 1 out of 3 days to 1 out of 5 days using your normal shampoo the other times you do wash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at my local natural market a few weeks ago for about $11.</li>
            <li> It smells like toilet bowl cleaner and you can smell it for days.</li>
            <li> It did a fantastic job getting rid of the dandruff, but the shampoo is so thick that I had trouble working it up to a lather to work through the ends of my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> I used it the same as I used any other shampoo, massaged it into the scalp for a minute or two and left it sit for 1-2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I had to wash with the shampoo every day to avoid flakes falling on all my clothes and, of course, it left my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp has always been difficult to clean properly.</li>
            <li> I used to use head &amp; shoulder and that would work sometimes, but generally, no matter what shampoo, my hair would go through cycles of an itchy dry scalp on a monthly basis.</li>
            <li> And I tried several different things before I found a way to cover the smell coming from my hair (fyi, other people can smell it from 4 feet away!!  or further depending on the breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike others who thought it smelled bad, I rather liked that \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> This really works well and it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing but not too bad at least to me.</li>
            <li> I agree, the smell is pretty bad, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is VERY drying on the delicate skin on the face.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re the type that loves the fruit and flower artificial scents found in most shampoos, then you probably won&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have had dandruff for as long as I remember.</li>
            <li> Also, because there&#x27;s no lather, you need to rinse your hair twice or three times as long or else</li>
            <li> He has been dealing with dandruff for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think, for me, this won&#x27;t work in the long term.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a gift, but I&#x27;ll be purchasing this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic derm and this shampoo seems to be helping but through this long process of dealing with SD for 4 years I am realizing that when something works it seems to not work</li>
            <li> Because my hair is long, I can smell the sulphur.  </li>
            <li> my hair is about 3 inches long</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> However, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair too long after I shower.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 3 washes to get rid of everything, but once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s gone as long as you use the shampoo</li>
            <li> It is NOT natural.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have a problem with the lack of lather (and I have long hair)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have extremely long hair that the smell still lingers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who seems to have a perpetually flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> I had looking out for a organic Dandruff shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is no different, it is in some ways worse because firstly it does not treat dandruff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how this holds up in the long run, as we&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I expected a little help but not a complete clear up!  </li>
            <li> I have has dry scalp problems for long time.</li>
            <li> With Jason Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, you get both in one, easy application; effective relief from even the worst dandruff, and a faint but constant fart smell that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> and it seems other sellers have had the same experience.   </li>
            <li> It will not foam up, spread properly, or smell like any other shampoo you have tried.</li>
            <li> I tried the other J/A/S/O/N product -- the one in the white bottle with a koala on the front</li>
            <li> The sulfur odor tends to linger for several hours after I shampoo, but I don&#x27;t think other people notice it.</li>
            <li> My entire living room smelled like this product due to the smell emitting out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> The sulfur, in the product, needs to be masked and the dandruff control is pretty weak IMO.  </li>
            <li> I did every other day for the next 6 days).  </li>
            <li> This product combines that treatment with two other traditional treatments for dandruff, colloidal sulfur and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> I have only ever found 1 other shampoo that allowed me to &#x27;see my scalp.\\</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, a lot of them and none of them worked or just worked temporarily</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product last time I used it, improved/ diminished my itchy dry winter scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other shampoos during the dry winter months and this is the only one that works well for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I think they had a very minimal effect, but not enough to alleviate my condition in any sense.      </li>
            <li> Brand name anti-dandruff shampoos never worked well for very long</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered from dandruff for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad dandruff, and Head &amp; Shoulders and some others has never really worked for me, but this stuff cleared it right up</li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t think it was a BAD smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is my favorite smell in the world.</li>
            <li> After have proven almost everything for my stubborn seborrheic scurf finally I found the relief in Jason Dandruff Shampoo, in addition don&#x27;t have the usually bad smell of most dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I read that sulphur helps dry it out and kill ringworm as it has antibacterial and antifungal properties.  </li>
            <li> so I could (i thought) put it on the list of things that didn&#x27;t help my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It removed a lot of dry skin around my nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin and dandruff issues all of my life.  </li>
            <li> I can see a difference in how dry my scalp is and</li>
            <li> Helps control my dry scalp without all of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo,scalp treatment, and oil for my dry scalp and until I used this shampoo everything else cannot compare.</li>
            <li> It has helped him get rid of his flakes and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make sense that it would help with a dry scalp?</li>
            <li> With one use i could see the difference and it solved the dry scalp issue.</li>
            <li> and once my hair is dry the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> He has dry scalp and this product has helped him a lot.</li>
            <li> So i went online, did some research about dry scalp.</li>
            <li> So, since Jason had the same active ingredients and it was cheaper, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This stuff also doesn&#x27;t foam up like standard shampoo but that seems to be common with natural brands</li>
            <li> But the apple cider vinegar just made my hair stink, the baking soda paste was messy, and the natural oils left my hair an oily mess.  </li>
            <li> The only thing, which I know is probably unavoidable, is that it does leave a slight strange odor from the sulfur content.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african American and my hair is natural and very thick.</li>
            <li> I had used Sebulex for the last 15 years, but it is hard to find and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was becoming a lizard person because my body was regenerating scales like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It was a small price to pay to completely treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> My dandruff levels decreased and the itchiness definitely went down after a week of consistent use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get where I live, so</li>
            <li> I guess it all boils down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> it has basically eliminated all of the flakes from the hair and my dry itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> While I have less flaking overall</li>
            <li> It was super frustrating!</li>
            <li> If your hair is similar to mine, you may also want to use a little cream conditioner for dry or damp hair after you get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seriously considered doing a video review to show exactly how to use this video, but first that would be a little weird, and second I don&#x27;t have any water proof video equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep cleaning, it also really tangled my long hair and made it really difficult to comb out -even with a lot of smoothing conditioner in my hair, before I rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I developed a bad case of seborrheic dermatitis and possibly a mild case of scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> honestly, I wanted it BECAUSE of the ingredients I mentioned, in combination with the others, which made me very unhappy when I received it.   </li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair smelled terrible during hot weather, even right after washing it.  </li>
            <li> This certainly does not smell any worse than that.</li>
            <li> Finally after going to the dermatologist and getting steriod creme I am getting a little relief after one week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous over the counter products with little to no affect.  </li>
            <li> It only helped a little bit with my scalp flaking.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually helped me a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it makes my hair frizzy, dry, etc as some other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have dandruff, but this was recommended tp me for dry scalp due to eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didnt leave my hair dry and my scalp with dandruff like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I alternate it with another shampoo, typically shampooing every other day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo for whenever My dandruff gets bad.</li>
            <li> Most people agreed that the stuff worked, but smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> I would have so many that it was painful to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> As my secondary shampoo I use another Jason shampoo especially for red hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it enough, but I used it almost everyday for a week.</li>
            <li> so I used a different shampoo for a few days</li>
            <li> Once he stops, the flakes come back after a few days or weeks.</li>
            <li> The 2% acid is so low that a dime shaped amount can not do any harm except to those dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Sebulex, T Gel by Neutrogena, Head and Shoulders, Selsen Blue, Nizoral and a few others that I cannot remember and this shampoo tops them all.</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle of shampoo, things were a bit worse for me.</li>
            <li> I never really got shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I think I spent around $15.</li>
            <li> seems expensive but its worth.</li>
            <li> I was obviously not really convinced it was going to do anything</li>
            <li> This shampoo has not really been improving my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> it works well on the dandruff even after only a few washes-</li>
            <li> I used it twice a week for over a month (sometimes 3 times) and it did not really do what i expected.</li>
            <li> My dandruff has definitely decreased, not 100% gone, but the real benefit was with the itching.  </li>
            <li> Even after using it everyday for a month, same problem persists.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that i may be allergic to the harsh ingredients in regular shampoo!</li>
            <li> A few months later it was all gone.</li>
            <li> Some times, my hair would be wet, but scalp had dried and the burn was back!  </li>
            <li> but it does have a strong unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This wash has a strong smell, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t stay on his head all day.</li>
            <li> strong in an unpleasant way.</li>
            <li> I had given up wearing black shirts and it was very embarrassing when I was sitting on any couch and had the dry scalp tracks behind me...  </li>
            <li> But like all the others, I have to alternate shampoos because it seems they don&#x27;t work if you keep using them everyday or every other day.</li>
            <li> Did I mention I have long, black hair?  </li>
            <li> If less problem is present, then less smell.  </li>
            <li> and it has recently been theorized that Rosacea and some scalp problems are caused by Demodex mites, which are killed by sulfur, the active ingredient in this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad dandruff in the winters and during the season changes, and this spring I was desperate for some kind of relief.</li>
            <li> (as extreme as say, pieces as wide as my pinky nail) fall on my desk, arms and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> You will want to use Jason&#x27;s shampoo every other day for half as long as it took to get rid of the smell</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a smell in your hair very long, but I could care less anyways.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO bad that it actually sent my sister inlaw into a full blown asthma attack.</li>
            <li> All these brand name shampoos (Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue, etc) work by just taking care of symptoms and generally leave you worse off after you stop using their</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t gotten a lot of use due to the smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor like my dad did, so I tried looking for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I have tried to switch to other products.  </li>
            <li> He used it every day for a couple weeks, then went to every other day for a while &amp; now uses it about twice per week.  </li>
            <li> However, I discovered it&#x27;s other purpose by accident</li>
            <li> So I checked all of the ingredients in the kit, and started looking at other products.</li>
            <li> After trying every dandruff shampoo I could get my hands on over the past year, I finally found one that works.</li>
            <li> I usually use another shampoo to actually wash my hair after I use the antidandruff Jason.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t do anything for me; in the past I&#x27;ve had to use Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li> I backed off to every other day, then after a year or so twice a week.  </li>
            <li> No more embarrassing giant flakes,</li>
            <li> no more wake up in the middle of the night with my pillow covered in little/big/round flakes,</li>
            <li> Other dandruff shampoos smell like soap,</li>
            <li> It got rid of the itching and most of the flaking after two uses, however, it STINKS!</li>
            <li> I actually thought I could get past that if it worked.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is unlike any other I have used.</li>
            <li> It does smell like any other dandruff shampoo, so don’t expect floral or fruity senses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t check other reviews to see if this was intended, but I cannot handle it.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about this product, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has taken the itch away except extreme diet changes (no sugars, gluten or dairy).  </li>
            <li> use it every other day and my dandruffs disappaered.</li>
            <li> If you do suffer from an excessively oily scalp and find it necessary to shampoo every day, I suggest that you use a solution of baking soda and water in between washes with JASON natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do apply other hair products when styling my hair and they seem to cover up the smell.  </li>
            <li> I was left with my lizard-like alien patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I use this stuff every other shampoo if the results will stick.  </li>
            <li> This product is for people who want to get rid of these problems and cannot find any other way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and have even recommended it to other people.  </li>
            <li> I tried to wash with other shampoos to get rid of the smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell issue - Well there is little smell and only little.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried a hundred other shampoos with no luck...</li>
            <li> Now I am using the shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> sulfur seems to be the active ingredient that is taking care of the problem.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredients in this shampoo include sulfur and salicylic acid, both of which are known for controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li> It lists two &#x27;active ingredients&#x27;, but the rest of the recipe is a mystery I guess.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is because they have to hide the scent of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is salicylic acid, which I learned a lot about during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was the active ingredient until I had used it once.</li>
            <li> This product was seriously a answer to my prayers, and I saw major improvements after using it ONCE.</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay the price, but I was hoping to maybe find something a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s way less offensive than competing dandruff shampoos like the Neutrogena coal tar and the other one</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it as it seemed to really dull and strip my blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, but a very small amount to cover only the scalp.</li>
            <li> To warn everyone, this is not your average shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell</li>
            <li> I have been getting so worried about wearing dark shirts/coats that I just always ended up wearing a beanie.</li>
            <li> I grew up with flaky hair and it had a serious affect on my self esteem and my social skills.  </li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with flakes my entire life pretty well and have always been frustrated by them.  </li>
            <li> I can wear dark shirts without any worries at all.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the maximum strength t-gel with no success.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have seborrheic dermatitis (basically psoriasis on the scalp and behind ears), and I am also starting to grow my hair out long</li>
            <li> I was tired of the chemical shiet and went for the natural and just one use</li>
            <li> If and when I develop bloody, pus-filled sores and wounds, then they&#x27;d be able to help.</li>
            <li> Some people complained in previous reviews about the smell, so I was a bit apprehensive, but actually I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I have always had a really dry scalp and just recently it has gotten worse</li>
            <li> It cuts down on my issues about 80%.</li>
            <li> it calmed down his scalp</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m down to once a week if I choose to twist hair or style</li>
            <li> Has cured the lifelong dandruff problem!!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!  </li>
            <li> Use it every other day and my head does not itch anymore!</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied minus the god awful toilet bowl cleaner smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my daughter who has really bad flaking on her scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is missing tea tree oil, sea weed extract, neem oil, AND it has  fragrance/parfume, none of which the other Jason bottle listed.</li>
            <li> I was using it everyday but decided to try it every other day and it works well.</li>
            <li> After a week or so the dandruff  was less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the only thing that has cleared up my itch scalp/dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair thicker, less frizzy</li>
            <li> no itching and no more dry flakes!</li>
            <li> There is a slight tinge of sulfur, but again, nothing that a conditioning treatment afterwards</li>
            <li> on advice of a dermatologist i got Neutrogena T-Sal which, when combined with prescription Betamethasone steroid gel (dries without residue), has 99% cured my previously uncontrollable seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased brands made by P&amp;G, Unilver, etc.</li>
            <li> I have skin allergies to a lot of the chemicals companies put in typical shampoos</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using half the bottle just to spread it throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Left it feeling sticky and was difficult to style later.</li>
            <li> My scalp has less buildup on it and  it controls my dandruff well.  </li>
            <li> However, the last couple of years I had serious issues with flakes, itchiness and irritation.</li>
            <li> I leave the shampoo in my hair for a half hour.</li>
            <li> and then it stops at about a half an hour.</li>
            <li> and it slightly flattens hair so if you have slightly oily hair it may weigh it down a little which is why i gave 4/5.</li>
            <li> , it just won&#x27;t form a lather and smells very unpleasant - you keep on using more to try and get a lather going.  </li>
            <li> Packaging her two bottles were sent here were not good, for one was a total mess.</li>
            <li> The downside, besides the smell is that my hair is a mess of frizziness.  </li>
            <li> But the product itself just simply was not good.</li>
            <li> After moving to Florida recently it got so much worse due to perspiring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through half a bottle now with no significant improvements.  </li>
            <li> Also the sulfur in it makes it smell a little strange and my boyfriend complained about the smell of my hair.</li>
            <li> I hardly saw a single flake after I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> No oil could cure it, but oil would only make it worse and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled on this at a grocery randomly and gave it a shot, and, bonus, it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> , I started waking up aware that I had subconsciously scratched and peeled my scalp and back of ears bloody in my sleep and the skin was still flaking off!</li>
            <li> It takes a little time getting</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive in ordering this because of the smell that people were complaining about.  </li>
            <li> Yes it has a little sulphur smell, but the shampoo itself smells like tea.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a little worried about what it&#x27;s going to do when I get my hair colored again).</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy even though it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> The product smells a little funky.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I would scratch my head raw on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every single product I could get my hands on to resolve this issue, it has been so bad, that I can scratch my head with a hairbrush and get enough scalp flakes to make several \\&quot;ant hills\\&quot; out of them on the floor.  </li>
            <li> , so my scalp was getting a little dried out.</li>
            <li> My scalp was the absolutely worst; very dry, flaky, and unsitely.. and most of all itchy.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, and it&#x27;s worth putting up with for a healthy scalp (anyone with bad dandruff can attest to putting up with worse with the likes of Denorex or Neutrogena T/Gel).  </li>
            <li> Needless to say my scalp is completely clear now.  </li>
            <li> The hair can be as moisturized as you like, but it won&#x27;t grow as much as you like if you have a consistently dirty scalp.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I was breaking out on my neck and the side of my face.</li>
            <li> I tried all the possible drugstore brands but it made things worse.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use it up so as not to waste it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used at night but is rather harsh to leave on while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick, curly hair and have never really had a problem with dandruff).</li>
            <li> He could see the difference in few uses.  </li>
            <li> The added fragrance actually makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually making my sinuses worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably take a few washes.  </li>
            <li> Odor aside, my scalp still itches so this was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> So far this is working where others have failed I  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with dandruff and dried out my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> Some said it dried their hair out,</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, it smelled like sulfur.  </li>
            <li> When all the bacteria is dead, the odor does NOT occur.</li>
            <li> Not a fabulous smell, BUT</li>
            <li> If I use it everyday in the morning, it is like I don&#x27;t have Psoriasis/Dandruff anymore.  </li>
            <li> My head smelled like a match and the smell didn&#x27;t go away when my hair dried.</li>
            <li> It has been a few weeks</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a chemical smell that does linger for a few days.</li>
            <li> I started using this because I was suggested by it on a few forums from research.</li>
            <li> Holy jibblies does this ever smell once you&#x27;ve rinsed it out and dried off.</li>
            <li> you condition afterwards, I suggest leaving the conditioner in for a few minutes to counterbalance the drying side</li>
            <li> waste of time and money....</li>
            <li> After a few times using it, you forget about the smell.</li>
            <li> No flakes, no itch, no more embarrassment wearing black.  </li>
            <li> Now after less than a week my head stopped itching and no more flakes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you can understand that you have to deal with a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; (pretty bad one at that) to get rid of a serious issue that has been affecting you for who knows how long, then this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> Brother had pretty bad dandruff, but i didn&#x27;t want him to use any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The back of my ears (where my glasses go behind my ear all &amp; all the way past that to my lobe where earrings go) became scaly</li>
            <li> Also, as others have pointed out, it smells pretty bad and sticks around.</li>
            <li> The smell in your hair is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> At first when I opened the bottle, I didn&#x27;t think the shampoo smelled that bad.</li>
            <li> and found they were not very effective.  </li>
            <li> I thought nothing could be worse then persistent dandruff but the sulfer in this leaves hair smelling like rotten eggs all day long!</li>
            <li> but my hair is very long and its worse.</li>
            <li> Painful and ended up being the most expensive shampoo I have ever used after the doctor bill and the medication.  </li>
            <li> I took a risk to try this brand that I have never heard of because I got tired of having to wash my hair every single day with nothing working.  </li>
            <li> A little bit hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> Not too mention I have tried other natural shampoos that smell just as bad.  </li>
            <li> But as time went on I noticed that this product really had a bad smell associated with it.</li>
            <li> my mom was soo shocked on how much dandruff was removed with one wash.</li>
            <li> I love it despite the awful smell.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I usually take a bath and let it sit on my scalp for awhile</li>
            <li> No more clawing at my head.  </li>
            <li> I expected much worse, like T-Gel or the like.</li>
            <li> The dandruff is gone and no more itching.</li>
            <li> no more shedding as I turned my head, no more burning,</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one day I was reading back through the reviews to figure out where I could have gone wrong, and one person noted that the directions stated to leave the shampoo in for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> [...]    Gets the same rating as Selsun Blue: [...]</li>
            <li> but I find it tolerable, not sure about the people around me.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure).</li>
            <li> This smells like guys organic products usually do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll even update this review in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I am sorry if this does not work for you after following my directions.  </li>
            <li> , I think a weird smell is not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> No more itching or embarrassing flakes.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a bottle each fall, and after two washes, my dandruff is gone.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get past</li>
            <li> It smells like a dirty, old motel room that needs a severe renovation.</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to find at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the contents</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think.</li>
            <li> It actually made my dandruff worse!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past four months, and intend to buy it again.</li>
            <li> which is weird because my boyfriend actually likes the smell.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen no more ringworm..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s upsetting when you spend $12 on a small bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as an alternative to my usual dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, we had to get something that doesn&#x27;t smell so...</li>
            <li> i went to my dermatologist and the rx he usually prescribes</li>
            <li> Bye bye harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> T-Gel, however I picked up some Tea Tree oil shampoo this past weekend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some problems over the past two winters that got really bad during this year&#x27;s long, long, looooooong winter.</li>
            <li> Then later that day, the itching got much worse and the flakes got worse.</li>
            <li> JASON shampoo gets rid of the flakes and doesn&#x27;t cause the skin irritation and painful zits that other products do, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> The major dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Denorex are produced by major players like Procter &amp; Gamble, which have horrible testing practices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get it on your scalp evenly.  </li>
            <li> Hardly get one or two.</li>
            <li> We have hard water</li>
            <li> I could hardly go to sleep after drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to treat-most</li>
            <li> The problem had gotten so bad that I shaved my head in order to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> Now when I get flare ups, they&#x27;re nowhere NEAR as bad.</li>
            <li> The one negative - this is a sulfer treatment, it smells like sulfur.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the smell, yes there is a smell to it</li>
            <li> Some said it didn&#x27;t work; some said it did; some really complained about an obnoxious foul/medicinal stench.    </li>
            <li> I use it once a week, sometimes twice if I get really dirty and sweaty that week, and it clears my head for an entire week!!!!</li>
            <li> Duh</li>
            <li> but only when I&#x27;m desperate.</li>
            <li> The trade off is that your head (and aura around you) smells like sulfur for at least 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it and am trying another brand - thankfully the mounds of dandruff have slowly disappeared since then.</li>
            <li> (Thick, flaky, uncontrollable sadness from ear to ear)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The itchiness is almost gone and slowly i am beginning to see fewer of the pimples or boils on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again if it wasn&#x27;t so thick because it did relieve the dandruff and itching.</li>
            <li> Thick foam.</li>
            <li> I get thick, flaky dandruff which has been resistant to every remedy until now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very distinct, and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; in the worst sense of the word.</li>
            <li> I mean if you already have a scalp issue (like I do)</li>
            <li> no more blood under my fingernails, and no visible shedding everywhere!  </li>
            <li> I worked to reduce his dermatitis without harsh chemicals and side effects!!</li>
            <li> No more snow on his shirt!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> When I really concentrate on the smell I also get a small whiff of something that reminds me of insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> This however has such an unpleasant stench to it.</li>
            <li> but those are very small prices to pay for the result.  </li>
            <li> , I think the tea tree is a very small component in this</li>
            <li> I used the very expensive Selsun Blue for years, then Head &amp; Shoulders came out with a selenium sulfide shampoo</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought this nasty smelling Jason shampoo again and after a week the itching had finally went away.</li>
            <li> It has less scary chemicals and fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> make it worse (with harsh irritating</li>
            <li> And, frankly, par for the course with any serious dandruff</li>
            <li> and I hated the smell while shampooing, which lingered long after my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> The only bad side is that it stinks, but who cares, once you dry it or use a scented conditioner, it tends to cover up the mediciny smell.</li>
            <li> Made my hair be a little weird.</li>
            <li> I used this and not only does it smell bad but</li>
            <li> It actually isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> This potency makes it almost nauseating border line vomit inducing, not so bad if you have short hair</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad that I only used it once.</li>
            <li> My teen age son was having a bad time with flaking.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get over how bad the smell still is after several hair washes.  </li>
            <li> The actual shampoo does not smell that bad.  </li>
            <li> Tonight was the 2nd night I used the shampoo and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Also  The shampoo stinks like a wet dog after you use it</li>
            <li> Not a good thing for prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> Not good for people with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick, and I don&#x27;t feel as guilty because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harsh chemicals a lot of dandruff shampoos do.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves a strange unpleasant scent on my hair that follows me throughout the day and gets on everything.</li>
            <li> I spent a portion of my day yesterday scraping off the scaly dead skin from my scalp. :(</li>
            <li> Sounds disgusting right?</li>
            <li> After using neutrogena body clear and being very disappointed, I had no idea what I was missing when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> When I use it in my own home it is so bad that I wake up with an awful taste in my mouth and a sore throat...</li>
            <li> The stuff smells pretty awful but it cleared up my stubborn scalp condition in 2 uses!</li>
            <li> and well I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li> not very impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair falls below my shoulder blades, is black, and is a coarse mix of wavy and curls on the worst day.  </li>
            <li> back to the product: I was getting very desperate until I came to Amazon and read people&#x27;s opinions on this shampoo that I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that bad at all.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as bad as when it dries.  </li>
            <li> worse it made my ears swell and blister.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the flakes and scaling on my scalp and behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago because I was tired of having a flaky scalp from dermatitis issues.  </li>
            <li> the worse the problem is.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt make it worse.</li>
            <li> Maybe my sense of smell is really poor?</li>
            <li> may be made it even worse, but there is an improvement on the dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The dandruff is gone for a day or two and then returns worse than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works for maybe a day and then gets SO MUCH WORSE</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing to help my scalp and smelled really nasty.</li>
            <li> Wish I could return it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t that expensive...</li>
            <li> That did not ameliorate the problem; in fact I think it got worse.</li>
            <li> I have never used a shampoo which makes my hair smell worse than before I washed it.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, if anything it got worse.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great.</li>
            <li> Some foreign smells, but nothing bad.  </li>
            <li> The sulfer in this product has eliminated the bad odor when other tricks (tea tree, lavender, vinegar, etc.) could not.  </li>
            <li> It seriously made me and my kid nauseous!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally care to write reviews on Amazon, nor have I had a terrible experience with them</li>
            <li> I was told I should get Jason Tea Tree Oil Shampoo to control my horrible, newly acquired dandruff.</li>
            <li> The reason I started using this Shampoo specifically is because my hair would have a bad smell to it a few hours after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t want to ever get to that crazy bloody skin-rotting-looking stage!!!    </li>
            <li> This actually made my itch worse and smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> This actually made my itch worse and smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> My son and I have bad dandruff and we usually use head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> (I have to, can&#x27;t return personal products), but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sulfur-like smell isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone makes it out to be, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Of course, once again, products marketed toward our problem failed to work.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am STUCK on this product and will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> This JASON dandruff shampoo smells weird, BUT</li>
            <li> Sadly I bought 2 bottles, but I will finish them.</li>
            <li> .. I ran upstairs to find her collapsed on her bedroom floor unable to breathe.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, just not the miracle shampoo for me that it is for all of you.</li>
            <li> I never did like the fake smelling shampoos filling the shelves nowadays.</li>
            <li> If this is where dog shampoo originated from, then I see why it&#x27;s always been somewhat expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> my hair and scalp was left smelling like horrible sulfur for days!</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered by mistake before I read the ingredient Iist and then was unable to cancel it.</li>
            <li> Lame lame lame.</li>
            <li> kinda weird,</li>
            <li> Difficult to lather up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using Philip B Anti-Flake, but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am trying to eliminate dandruff/dry scalp and unfortunately, I can&#x27;t review for that purpose at this time</li>
            <li> but I can tell you this shampoo has one of the worst odors I&#x27;ve smelt in quite a white.</li>
            <li> I had terrible itching if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair daily and scalp build up</li>
            <li> The worst thing I did was wash my hair with this, then wash it again the next day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of research on the effects of the nasty chemicals that are in regular hair care products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo, because I have a family that brought it in sad it should work on ringworm.</li>
            <li> it dried my hair very badly.</li>
            <li> smell is not as terrible as other</li>
            <li> au naturale - beauty is not worth the horrible flaking, burning and (what felt like) spreading skin condition and the flaking/scratching/shedding everywhere.    </li>
            <li> now there is little to no flakes falling out of my hair rather than bigg chunky nasty stuff falling</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve had some stinky dandruff shampoos), so I was worried I had a fake or a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my scalp started itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I had lice</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> When you suffer from skin ailments, your desperate for relief of the symptoms.</li>
            <li> My hair got crazy greasy</li>
            <li> It also absorbs smells like crazy.  </li>
            <li> it stinks</li>
            <li> My dandruff gets crazy now and again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the Jasons shampoo that has made this about turn around but am afraid to stop using it as my scalp was a nightmare before.</li>
            <li> I have had to wash my hair to get rid of this awful rubber smell at least 4 times now</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible to and will get you noticed in a negative way.</li>
            <li> If her scalp outbreak was bad, the smell was stronger.      </li>
            <li> people don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo, but I find it not so bad.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, it lingers on your fingers and in your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that it&#x27;s a bad product because I am not convinced that it is a bad product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> The downside to putting sulfur in your hair is that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit on the bad side</li>
            <li> This is what causes the bad odor.</li>
            <li> I never write bad reviews, but could not let anyone make the mistake of using this product.  </li>
            <li> , it might not be a bad smell to some people, but to me I felt as though I was prepping myself to be roasted or taking a bath w/ my dog.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son he has bad dandruff almost like cradle cap (he is 7) and</li>
            <li> By the end of day two, my scalp would be itching badly and become inflamed from the seborrhheic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> I have others smell my hair to get their opinion, and they don&#x27;t thinks it&#x27;s that bad, but still, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> though mine isn&#x27;t too bad in the firs place.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;B.U.T smells bad ..</li>
            <li> Really really bad</li>
            <li> Have read really bad things about SGS on the internet.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It might work, but it smells bad to me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find a shampoo for my scalp that works, but doesn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> my dandruff is really bad</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from bad dandruff for years, I tried everything from products from the USA, and herbal stuff from my country.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so bad as some people made it seem to be.</li>
            <li> I realized that when a drop of SGS touches my forehead I get a painful rash and breakout that lasts a week.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone use this is beyond me, it smells like sulfur and has been making me feel sick all day.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to rectify the situation!  </li>
            <li> ( :( :( :( :( :( :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the weird smells of medicated shampoos but this one is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> didnt work :(</li>
            <li> Some people hate the smell, so let me describe my experience with the smell:</li>
            <li> crap works if you have smelly hair syndrome.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of those smells in which you&#x27;ll ever like it or hate it depending on what you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> like I was a freak, even talked crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unpleasant</li>
            <li> I used to have a bad case of itch in my skull!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad and quite frankly if it clears up the dryness on my scalp, I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he hated it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works to keep the dandruff away without a doubt. However I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I would compare it to Nair hair removal products.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t for me it dried my hair very badly. I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work for others just my personal experience.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t gotten a lot of use due to the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great in the bottle, but after using and drying hair, our hair smelled like we had been around smokers.</li>
            <li> Great Natural product smells good too</li>
            <li> It is good, takes away the dandruff after a couple of washed. Doesn&#x27;t smell the sulfur smell as some reviewers have indicated. The old version without the rosemary etc. was better. Worked faster.</li>
            <li> Works good smells good enough.</li>
            <li> By far this is the only shampoo that works for me to get rid of the dandruff. It is strong, no doubt about that, what I do is use it every other day at the beginning, and progressively less, up to once a week to maintain. I have been using it this way for the past year and a half with good results.</li>
            <li> I have has dry scalp problems for long time. After each wash, I feel my scalp is not itchy any more and pretty fresh. I need to observe longer period to see whether it helps on hair dropping problems.</li>
            <li> works well but Im not kidding my dog hides under the bed because he thinks its bath time when I use it. * adding fifth star because this shampoo despite the smell is awesome..Doesnt leave your scalp feeling tight and uncomfortable like most dandruff shampoos and it is HIGHLY effective. Also leaves hair soft and manageable. I love it despite the awful smell.</li>
            <li> This actually made my itch worse and smelled terrible.  It smells like toilet bowl cleaner and you can smell it for days.</li>
            <li> Works but just be informed that you are buying a sulfur based natural Shampoo so there is a pretty strong sulfur smell that lingers for a day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as the smell is strong. However, IT WORKS! Great stuff that combats psoriasis, eczema and dandruff without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dandruff treatment I&#x27;ve found. Unlike some other more well known brands, this one actually works. Just make sure to leave it in for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my daughter who has really bad flaking on her scalp.  It seems to be the only thing that works.  I liked that it was full of tea tree oil, neem oil, and without sudsing agents, which just dry you out anyway.  It wasn&#x27;t at all harsh like the other chemical filled commercial products.  Yes, it does smell funky, but she&#x27;s not scratching at her head all day.    Recently though, we had a breakout of ringworm.  Of course, once again, products marketed toward our problem failed to work.  I read that sulphur helps dry it out and kill ringworm as it has antibacterial and antifungal properties.  So does tea tree oil and neem oil.  I decided to give it a go on myself.    Not only did it get rid of my ringworm its clearing up my body acne!!  I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne on my chest, arms and back since I was a teen.  Nothing worked.  This not only helps combat the problem, the combo of oils helps moisturize which is important to acne treatment.  I don&#x27;t need a seperate lotion.    Over time, the sulphur smell doesn&#x27;t linger as much on the skin.  The smell is strong when combating the problem.  If less problem is present, then less smell.  We&#x27;ve noticed this with my daughters head.  If her scalp outbreak was bad, the smell was stronger.      I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this shampoo because it is natural and it did seem to clear up some scalp problems at first. The first time I used it I noticed my hair felt heavier and a little oily, but I wanted to give myself a chance to get used to it. After a few weeks I was breaking out on my neck and the side of my face. I believe it was from the essential oils in the product. The thing that made me discontinue using it was that my hair started falling out along my part, which may be from the salicylic acid, which is one of the ingredients to help with the scalp. I&#x27;ve gone back to using a shampoo with pyrithione zinc, alternating it with DHS Clear and doing a vinegar rinse 1-2 times per week. The breakouts have stopped and my scalp and hair feel much better.</li>
            <li> I waited until I had used the whole bottle before writing a review. Unlike others who thought it smelled bad, I rather liked that \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; smell. I used the shampoo as directed but it did not take away the itch or reduce flaking. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I suffered from horrible dandruff and itchy scalp. It was to the point where i could not sleep at night because my scalp was severely irritated and flaky. I didn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor like my dad did, so I tried looking for other alternatives. I tried all the possible drugstore brands but it made things worse. Even if I did shower before i went to sleep, my scalp was flaking, incredibly itchy, and I found acne all over my scalp!.. I was tired of the chemical shiet and went for the natural and just one use i haven&#x27;t gotten dandruff since!.   When I left it on for a while I felt a burning sensation, and i liked it and kept massaging it all over.. I rinsed it off and put on my regular conditioner. I absolutely love this product and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I used this and not only does it smell bad but worse it made my ears swell and blister.  It also created blisters on the back of my neck.  This may be great for some, but please be careful.  Finally after going to the dermatologist and getting steriod creme I am getting a little relief after one week.  The doctor said it may take several weeks for my ears to clear up. I have never written a review before but wanted to spare someone the agony I have gone through. Painful and ended up being the most expensive shampoo I have ever used after the doctor bill and the medication.  Just look at the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Works great, I only use it once a week but that&#x27;s enough for me. Love the cooling feeling on my scalp and I don&#x27;t even notice the smell anymore, I kinda like it now.</li>
            <li> I developed a bad case of seborrheic dermatitis and possibly a mild case of scalp psoriasis.  I decided to go natural (this means to no longer use chemical relaxers in my African American hair).  The problem continued and in many cases, I feel that it got worse.  I had no idea what to do because the large flakes of skin and soreness, in addition to the itching were not making me an attractive female.  I had to do something to preserve the sexy.  I made an appointment with my doctor and was given prescription shampoo and cream. 2 weeks later, I felt like the problem had not changed a bit.  I did not next best thing in the entire world.  I googled it.  After reading several forums and contemplating purchasing a very expensive product, I saw some people talk about how this shampoo had been very effective.  Months later, I can personally tell you that this stuff has changed my life.  My hair was so horrible before.  One day after wash day, my hair would smell oily like I had never touched it.  Not to mention the flakes and scaling on my scalp and behind my ears.  After one use,  I noticed that the flaking was drastically better.  After 3 weeks, I was standing in a store and a fan was blowing on me.  Before, I would always stay away from fans because I felt like you could smell my hair....all I smelled was the products that I had used in my hair.  Nothing more.  I have tried to switch to other products.  In fact, I strayed last week and used a product that I thought would be better.  I spent a portion of my day yesterday scraping off the scaly dead skin from my scalp. :( Needless to say, I am STUCK on this product and will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has worked well on my natural 4A-4B African American hair and I really think that everyone who is suffering with some type of dandruff condition needs to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed by the results of this shampoo.  I purchased it for my husband who has very oily skin &amp; scalp.  He has never had dandruff, but his scalp &amp; hair would have an odor, even with shampooing 2-3 times/day.  I did some research via Google &amp; many others with this same problem recommended this Jason shampoo.  He tried it &amp; has had such good results.  He used it every day for a couple weeks, then went to every other day for a while &amp; now uses it about twice per week.  Not only can he still use regular shampoo on the days in between, but he only has to wash his hair once each day.  It does have a strong sulfur/medicinal odor, but is to be expected.  It doesn&#x27;t bother us much because 1) his hair is short &amp; 2) sulfur seems to be the active ingredient that is taking care of the problem.  My husband has very short hair, so I don&#x27;t notice an odor during the day--just when he&#x27;s in the shower &amp; the steam fills the room with the shampoo smell.  I should mention, we tried Selsun Blue, T-Gel &amp; good ol&#x27; Head &amp; Shoulders before buying this and nothing worked until this.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 5-11-12***&lt;br /&gt;Just received the new bottle I ordered &amp; the label is different.  It does not contain Tea Tree Oil now.  This is a big bummer, since I really felt like that was one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> It works well.  GF says it smells like flea shampoo for dogs.  Has issued 100-yard restraining order.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> OK, I have had some kinda dandruff/dry scalp thing going on for over 10 years.  I had red, dry, scaley scalp that was always itchy - spring, summer, fall, and especially winter time.  I had given up wearing black shirts and it was very embarrassing when I was sitting on any couch and had the dry scalp tracks behind me...  I am 31 years old and have spend hundreds (maybe thousands if you include dermatologist bills) of dollars on trying to find a \\&quot;fix\\&quot;...  From \\&quot;Head n Shoulders\\&quot; to dermatologist prescribed steroids. Nizoral was my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; shampoo, but it did not stop the problem.  This JASON dandruff shampoo smells weird, BUT IT WORKS!!!!!!!  My wife things it has a burning scent, but the both of us agree it is worth it!!!    I have never written an online review before, but thought this is something people should know about!  and hopefully worth some good karma ;-)  I hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> Has cured the lifelong dandruff problem!!</li>
            <li> I think I actually have scalp psorisis, so before this, I tried everything.  The only product that seemed to work was Head and Shoulders \\&quot;intense.\\&quot;  But, since using Jason, my dandruff hasn&#x27;t returned, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw, and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade away as quickly at all.     The only bad side is that it stinks, but who cares, once you dry it or use a scented conditioner, it tends to cover up the mediciny smell.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes from this product as per the reviews. I have tried all kinds of shampoos on the market but none worked to get rid of my flaky scalp. This product is no different, it is in some ways worse because firstly it does not treat dandruff and secondly it smells like medicine. A big letdown.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t personally work out for me. Within the first few tries of using it, my scalp became extremely dry and built up clusters of dandruff on my head. Also, as others have pointed out, it smells pretty bad and sticks around. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and am trying another brand - thankfully the mounds of dandruff have slowly disappeared since then. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed since many others had such great results with this product, but I guess it can&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago because I was tired of having a flaky scalp from dermatitis issues.  I have used it every other day as suggested and I am flake free!  Some people say it will work the same day, but for me it really took 2 weeks to start working.  Also there IS a smell to the product but after doing research I found out the stronger the smell the worse the problem is.  This means once you start to get it rolling and your problem goes away, so does the smell.  I am down to very little smell which is nice!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad dandruff in the winters and during the season changes, and this spring I was desperate for some kind of relief. I really like this shampoo. When I use it, I usually take a bath and let it sit on my scalp for awhile so it can really soak in ... maybe 10 min or so before I wash it off.     Some people complained in previous reviews about the smell, so I was a bit apprehensive, but actually I like the scent. It&#x27;s sort of herbal/earthy. My husband likes it too--he always tells me I smell nice after I&#x27;ve used it. So I guess it just depends on if you like earthy smells or not.     In conclusion, the shampoo seems to work pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t make the dandruff go away forever, but it keeps it pretty under control, and it&#x27;s a natural product, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is missing tea tree oil, sea weed extract, neem oil, AND it has  fragrance/parfume, none of which the other Jason bottle listed. The bottle states \\&quot;new look/same great formula\\&quot; but this is an outright lie. However, I don&#x27;t doubt this shampoo can perform as intended.  It still has the colloidal sulfur, the salicylic acid, and MSM. BUT if you&#x27;re looking for a product with the ingredients I listed above, you will be left wanting as the new Jason product no longer includes these ingredients and honestly, I wanted it BECAUSE of the ingredients I mentioned, in combination with the others, which made me very unhappy when I received it.   However, this shampoo, while I&#x27;m not using it for my hair seems to radically clear up the acne on my back.  After using neutrogena body clear and being very disappointed, I had no idea what I was missing when I ordered this. However, I discovered it&#x27;s other purpose by accident and it seems other sellers have had the same experience.   HAVE BODY ACNE?! USE THIS, you won&#x27;t regret it. :) It might smell funny, but it works. Looks like I&#x27;ll be buying more of this product after all. DO NOT use this product on your face, though unless you have naturally oily skin.  It is VERY drying on the delicate skin on the face. I use topix benzoyl peroxide with aloe vera for my face and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> so, i bought this product because it got fairly good reviews and i didn&#x27;t want to spend too much (previously bought Regenepure DR, pretty effective but $25 is too much for shampoo.) First of all, it smelled funny. I guess its the sulfur. Second, it doesn&#x27;t really work. It somewhat helped with the itchiness, but not the dryness. I think the smell bothered me more than anything, it&#x27;s a mix of smokiness and chemical. If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d probably chalk up the extra $13 and just buy Regenepure again because at least the smell is nice and minty.</li>
            <li> I had tried all kinds drug-store dandruff shampoos and every homeopathic treatment under the sun. I just could not get rid of the sudden dandruff problem that was plaguing my days. I searched online and found this stuff. Holy hey it works! After a week or so the dandruff  was less noticeable. After about three weeks it was totally gone. I used it for about 1.5 months just to be sure and it has been about 3 months now with no return of dandruff. If you have an especially bad case, this will work for you!  The one negative - this is a sulfer treatment, it smells like sulfur. It is a very strong smell that tends to linger so be prepared. It was a small price to pay to completely treat my dandruff. I recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo so far that has worked with my dandruff problem.  I use it every other day, but a very small amount to cover only the scalp. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for everyone, but it does for me and I have used many other brands OTC including prescribed ones.</li>
            <li> Be warned! This stuff smells awful and the smell lingers even after using conditioner, leave in etc. The smell is nauseating. I cant speak for how much it relieves dandruff. It doesnt make it worse. Sadly I bought 2 bottles, but I will finish them.</li>
            <li> I am dandruft free after so many years of trying different products. Highly recomend it!!! My hair feels clean and I dont have to worry about wearing black at all. Price is not but at all.</li>
            <li> The consistency/texture of this product is dreamy.  And I don&#x27;t know why,&lt;br /&gt;but the scent is so lovely that when the bottle arrived at my work place,&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed some on just to smell it!  I have been purchasing Jason products since I changed to the vegan lifestyle 52 days ago and I love the products.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he hated it so I decided to use it up so as not to waste it but I can&#x27;t stand it either, it just won&#x27;t form a lather and smells very unpleasant - you keep on using more to try and get a lather going.  To be honest, neither of us could bring ourselves to use it long enough to see if it had any therapeutic effect so I am giving it two stars for its possible effectiveness.</li>
            <li> it is very good product , despite its strong smell :)&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t see the claps anymore . thanks for delivering fast ^_^</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as the first reviewer - all flaking from seborrhoeic dermatitis disappeared after a single use. I&#x27;d tried sulphur shampoos before but there must be something special about the combination of ingredients in the Jason shampoo.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product about six months ago because my scalp was in good condition after regular use of Jason&#x27;s. Well after not using it my scalp became itchy and scaly again. This product works for me.</li>
            <li> To warn everyone, this is not your average shampoo. It will not foam up, spread properly, or smell like any other shampoo you have tried. With that said, it does alleviate the symptons of dandruff. As others have mentioned, it does have a very strong smell, but I think it is a small price to pay for a natural dandruff shampoo that delivers results. I make sure to rinse my hair thoroughly before using a second, better smelling shampoo (I like Trichomania solid shampoo and Curly Wurly shampoo from Lush). I also use nice conditioners like Coolaulin from Lush and MOP Leave-In Conditioner. I find that these methods help get rid of the medicinal odor. And no, I don&#x27;t work for Lush, and they&#x27;re not paying me to endorse their products.</li>
            <li> I find that this product works good. It is the best shampoo that I have used for my dandruff situation up to this date. I give it four stars because I find that as good as it is I do still have flakes from time to time while combing my hair.</li>
            <li> Positives :&lt;br /&gt;1. You can say goodbye to your dandruff by using this product .&lt;br /&gt;2. Very nice for the oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Better if you use it with another shampoo . ( if you use Jason on Sat for example , use the other shampoo on Tues ) because some kind of dandruff require changing between 2 kinds of shampoo and changing the order of using them .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives :&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is not bad but so strong . But you will get use to it by time .</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shampoo in an effort to get rid of head lice. I had been trying every over-the-counter product there is, and we just couldn&#x27;t get the bugs to go away completely and STAY gone. My biggest problem was that most of the OTC products were burning my daughter&#x27;s skin, not to mention what they were doing to her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a natural health food store to see if I could find something there to help. I found a lice kit, but it cost almost $30. I was willing to pay the price, but I was hoping to maybe find something a bit less expensive. So I checked all of the ingredients in the kit, and started looking at other products. I found the JASON dandruff shampoo, and it had  all of the active ingredients in it that the lice kit did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo much like you would a lice treatment, leaving it on for about 10 minutes, washing it out, and combing. It worked like a charm and we so far haven&#x27;t had any recurring lice problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve been using it on myself, as I have horrible psoriasis on my scalp. The problem had gotten so bad that I shaved my head in order to help clear it up. I find that this shampoo is a wonderful addition to my regimen for maintaining a healthy scalp. Now when I get flare ups, they&#x27;re nowhere NEAR as bad. In fact, my worst flare ups now are better than my best days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo, but I find it not so bad. I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant, but it&#x27;s not disgusting. I guess it all boils down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, it lingers on your fingers and in your hair. Still have dandruff, didn&#x27;t make a difference. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it enough, but I used it almost everyday for a week. The smell is pretty off-putting though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like that. I don&#x27;t want to say that it&#x27;s a bad product because I am not convinced that it is a bad product. At least it&#x27;s sulfate free. I mean if you already have a scalp issue (like I do) then why would you want to clean your hair with uber harsh industrial strength detergents? That makes sense right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logic is solid. But the fact is that the stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t stop the flakes or the itching at all. That doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t work for anyone, but in my own personal case it didn&#x27;t so much as make a dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally.... the stuff smells like BUG SPRAY!! I&#x27;m not even kidding! The smell is GROSS!</li>
            <li> The stuff smells pretty awful but it cleared up my stubborn scalp condition in 2 uses! Selsun Blue stopped working for me about a year ago and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos since then. I will put up with the smell for the great results. I hope it keeps working!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every scalp treatment I can get my paws on. I have even gone through phases of putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp... so a strong smell from a natural product doesn&#x27;t normally get to me... till now! This stuff is SO bad that it actually sent my sister inlaw into a full blown asthma attack. She walked upstairs about 5 minutes after I got out of the shower and I heard her say \\&quot;What kind of sham...(choking and gasping)\\&quot;.. I ran upstairs to find her collapsed on her bedroom floor unable to breathe. I had to wash my head twice to get the smell out enough that she could stand it.. When I use it in my own home it is so bad that I wake up with an awful taste in my mouth and a sore throat... I thought that couldn&#x27;t be!!! so I used a different shampoo for a few days and I didn&#x27;t have the problem.. as soon as I started using this product again I woke up with a sore throat again. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work on your scalp.. It did an okay job as far as that went... but I&#x27;d rather scrub my head with a skunk. This stuff is rancid.</li>
            <li> Best natural shampoo I found for dandruff</li>
            <li> It works great and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works great without a bunch of chemicals - I never get dandruff anymore. Is also a good regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work decent. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried at this point. Does have a medicinal smell from the sulfur but my hair products covered it up easily. I have stopped using it as it seemed to really dull and strip my blonde highlights. Needless to say, that didn&#x27;t make me happy. Have gone a different route now hoping to restore the color (thinking it was maybe a buildup of something) but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening. As a side note, my lowlights are fine (brunette) so it appears it&#x27;s just the blonde it affected.</li>
            <li> After trying every dandruff shampoo I could get my hands on over the past year, I finally found one that works. This relieved the dermititis on my scalp and cleared it up on my face, too. I no longer have a sore scalp with itchy bumps; my face is no longer peeling off as if I have had a sunburn. I&#x27;m not up to the skipping more than a day of use, yet. I tried and my scalp started itching and breaking out; face began to peel after 48 hours - so back to almost every day use. Don&#x27;t care - it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked. I&#x27;ve found I can combat any slight lingering sulfur smell by rinsing really well with some distilled water and using a great smelling coconut conditioner. I&#x27;d probably use it even if I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the smell since I can touch my scalp without pain now.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a fantastic job of controlling my psoriasis/dandruff while also keeping my hair healthy. I alternate it with another shampoo, typically shampooing every other day. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Most reviews made this sound amazing. Not so for us. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the only thing that has cleared up my itch scalp/dandruff issue. Seriously, I would scratch my head raw on a daily basis. I&#x27;m a bit of a hippie anyways but I went back to Head and Shoulders looking for SOMETHING that would work. I stumbled on this at a grocery randomly and gave it a shot, and, bonus, it&#x27;s natural! Yay!</li>
            <li> My kids and I both get really dry scalp in the winter and regular dandruff shampoos were not working.  I purchased this and within the first week of use, the itching has gone away on my head and I haven&#x27;t seen my kids scratch their heads since I began to use it.  The smell is a bit intense, but not unpleasant. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other kind of dandruff shampoo and would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It did not help with the eczema problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry scalp my entire life. I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo out there and have even had prescription shampoos and conditioners! I just happened upon this shampoo and decided to try it so I could (i thought) put it on the list of things that didn&#x27;t help my dry scalp. But, oh my goodness it&#x27;s amazing! AMAZING!! Not only is my dry scalp gone but my course curly hair looks and feels better than it has since I was a kid!! My husband, who doesn&#x27;t have dandruff/dry scalp uses it to because of how awesome it makes his hair look/feel. Try this shampoo, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has improved my scalp and my overall complection immensely.  I use it on my face as well and it works much better then all the acne products that I have tried.  It is very gentle and I actually like the herbal smell. I color my hair with henna so I don&#x27;t have to use any hairconditionars after I shampoo. My hair is already conditioned. I usually use another shampoo to actually wash my hair after I use the antidandruff Jason.  As other rewiers pointed out, this particular Jason shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily.  It really is a scalp treatment.  As my secondary shampoo I use another Jason shampoo especially for red hair.  The combination works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - total waste of money! They don&#x27;t make it like they used to. Used to have Neem and Tea tree oil.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo it cured my itchy scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great because it provides dandruff relief AND is both organic and not tested on animals. The major dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Denorex are produced by major players like Procter &amp; Gamble, which have horrible testing practices.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell of this product is VERY intense. It smells borderline medicinal, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and now think of the smell as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, definitely worth the benefits of a moral product that helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo for whenever My dandruff gets bad. This really works well and it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing but not too bad at least to me. Leaves your scalp feeling super soothed and is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!  I&#x27;ve used several shampoos over the years for irritation and flaking.  None ever worked that well.  I have been trying to use more natural products such as soaps and skincare products.  I thought I would try this shampoo as well since I had nothing to lose except for the price of the bottle.  (That price is cheap and very worth it by the way.)  It started working right away!  I have used it now for well over a year and no signs of dandruff have ever come back.  It does not lather like chemical shampoos and the smell does take some getting used to but those are very small prices to pay for the result.  I do have short hair and the smell does go away so no one else can smell it on you if you are worried about that.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t do anything for me; in the past I&#x27;ve had to use Selsun Blue. However, I hate SLS, so the journey to finding a non-SLS dandruff shampoo was on!    I tried the other J/A/S/O/N product -- the one in the white bottle with a koala on the front and it had tea tree oil for dandruff control -- and it didn&#x27;t work. $11-$12 is a freakin lot to pay for shampoo, but I was at the point where I would pay almost anything!! Here&#x27;s how to use this product: Every other day at first, and then 1-2 times a week for maintenance. I cannot really spread it as it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather up, so I take some in my hand and just put it on my scalp and comb through my hair with my fingers still on my scalp to try to get every bit of my head covered. Then I use another SLS-free shampoo to get the rest of my hair. It took about 3 uses of every-other-day washing to get my scalp completely itch- and flake- free. I took a 5-day trip this past week without bringing this shampoo and I am incredibly happy to report that I did not have any dandruff that whole trip or even as much of an itchy scalp when I got back!!! So not only does this work when you apply it, but it also keeps on working after. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; cases.  While this seemed to be working for a while, it isn&#x27;t really.  I&#x27;ve been through half a bottle now with no significant improvements.  Any improvements I saw during the initial use were likely attributed to the apple cider vinegar rinses I was doing at the time (and intend to go back to doing).    Personally I thought this would have a very strong tea tree potency, or at least a lot of neem oil.   But it doesn&#x27;t.  It smells like sulfur... AKA, poop, rotten eggs, etc.  It smells disgusting and it&#x27;s just not that great.  I&#x27;ve been trying diligently and it&#x27;s not doing a thing on it&#x27;s own but make me, my shower, and my bath towels, STINK.  I think the stuff might work if it didn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, but it does, and that has ALWAYS exacerbated my condition much more than help it.  My SLS free tea tree shampoo, also by JASON, does just as much good as this stuff.    This product though?  Not any better than selsun blue.  Sorry guys, just not the miracle shampoo for me that it is for all of you.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used in my entire life.  No build up feeling on hair or scalp.  Hair is soft after, love this shampoo.  Very thick shampoo, soaps up nicely, leaves hair soft and conditioned And! helps clear my scalp.</li>
            <li> Product does not work that well. I followed the directions but I still have dandruff 24 hours later. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the product even though it&#x27;s has a terrible odor. Good smelling conditioner helps to combat the shampoos odor. Packaging her two bottles were sent here were not good, for one was a total mess. Skimpy packaging without cushioning allowed the parcel to have one bottle leak.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is concentrated so I get more for my dollar. Also,due to the Neem Oil in it, I was able to use it to treat my daughter,with eczema for lice.</li>
            <li> Hands down this product works &amp; leaves my scalp feeling a little tingly (which I love!)  I have oily skin &amp; sometimes get mild dandruff (on days when I don&#x27;t sleep as much as I should)  Selsun &amp; other products were wayy to strong for someone like me (who has a case of occasional dandruff), this one works!</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness goes, this stuff works.  I have uber sensitive skin, and it does not make me itch....so yay!  However, it smells like roach poison.  Seriously.  This is some nasty smelling stuff.  But, it works.  Eeny Meenie Miney Mo.....</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, who has moderate dandruff. It is pretty persistent, and never responded to other dandruff shampoos. IT WORKS! When he uses it, he never has dandruff. EVER. Once he stops, the flakes come back after a few days or weeks. I used to buy it at our local health food store, but we recently moved far from any such store, so here I am ordering it online. He&#x27;s been using it for years, and there is nothing like it.     The smell is like a lot of chemical-free beauty products, and smells like essential oils, most noticeably, tea tree oil. If you love the smell of fake bath and body works types of chemical fragrances, (some of us actually find that stuff very offensive!) this will smell a little strange to you at first. The odor is much less noticeable than a head full of flakes! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have had dandruff for as long as I remember. I have tried every product on the market and still had flakes.  I used this product every day for a week and then read the instructions.  I backed off to every other day, then after a year or so twice a week.  Now I use it once a week and nary a flake.  No more clawing at my head.  It is a real blessing.  Gave a bottle to my daughter and son-in-law and they have had excellent results as well.[[ASIN:B000FGDIAS JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and a lot of it. My scalp has always been difficult to clean properly. Itching and build up have been something I just endured. After moving to Florida recently it got so much worse due to perspiring. I had to find a solution but none of the products available in stores worked for long. I did some research and know that herbal products work so well for so many things and decided to try the JASON Dandruff Relief Shampoo. After reading the other reviews I felt confident this was what I needed. Well, I was a little worried about the smell since my husband loves to smell my clean hair. It actually isn&#x27;t that bad. I expected much worse, like T-Gel or the like. I use many herbal products and love shampoos that are herbal and essential oil based anyway. I never did like the fake smelling shampoos filling the shelves nowadays. The JASON shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam like we are used to but it does clean well. Squeeky &amp;lt;sp&gt; clean! Follow directions on bottle. I used a little more than they suggest due to thick medium length hair in order to get full scalp coverage, I also comb it through like when I condition it. I think the Tea Tree and Rosemary come through more than the Sulfer smell. Smells clean and &#x27;real&#x27; to me. Not artificial! After 2 weeks washing everyother day, my scalp is feeling so much calmer! Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a one-star because I just received the product and it is different from the listing. I specifically wanted a shampoo with Tea Tree Oil in it. (As well as the Neem.) Neither Tea Tree Oil or Neem are in the new version of the product. Instead, I get Rosemary and Olive Oil! Greaaaat. I&#x27;ll still try it out and see how it works (I have to, can&#x27;t return personal products), but I&#x27;m very disappointed. Be warned that the product is no longer what is listed above. (If they have updated the listing, please ignore this review.)</li>
            <li> Product works great. I would like to buy it again. it is what they say. My hair is nice in shiny. I don&#x27;t see any dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was reading all the reviews on this product and decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did because it works really good. The dandruff is gone and no more itching. Others have complained about the smell, yes there is a smell to it but it&#x27;s not that bad and you get used to it. Besides, the shampoo really works so it&#x27;s worth it. Just ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this for my son until I noticed it had tea tree oil in it. There have been some studies on hormone problems with it for young boys. Look it up before you buy for children!</li>
            <li> It took time for me to review this product but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars (can I add 1 more?)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dandruff issues and started using the Nizo$o4@L and got rid of it in a few days but then came back with more intense itching while still using it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then searching Amazon showed me this Jason Natural Dandruff Relief Shampoo... and been more than 6 months now with no dandruff, using it once a week only as maintenance now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying this again and highly recommend it to all...</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while because it is effective for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  However, as others have already remarked on, the smell can be overpowering, especially first thing in the morning (which is when I shower).  Also, because there&#x27;s no lather, you need to rinse your hair twice or three times as long or else you will end up leaving gobs of the stuff on your hair.  So I&#x27;ve finally had it with this product.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant after reading the mixed reviews. Some said it didn&#x27;t work; some said it did; some really complained about an obnoxious foul/medicinal stench.    First off a summary of my review:  - Individual with seborrheic dermatitis as a result of hair color treatment with excessive dandruff and plaque, peeling, flaking, and fiery itchy burn.  - Apply said all natural product whose scent is on par with that of Selsum Blue, but with significant less foaming/sudsing (image using 3 times the dollop size you typically use with your regular commercialized shampoo)  - Said all natural product alleviate and eliminated color-treated scalp condition and improved condition equal to and above pre-color treated scalp condition; however, did not completely eliminate (but did alleviate) peripheral conditions as a result of scalp condition.  - Result: I&#x27;m a fan! Thanks for fixing my scalp and making me and my home and all around me better and happier.    A little history abt my problem:  I typically use Head &amp; Shoulders Ocean Lift or Refresh as I suffer from frequent dandruff and mild scalp itchiness. Overall it was kind of a hit or miss affair with dandruff. As I got older, I started coloring my hair more to cover my premature grays. Over the span of 18-24 months of monthly/every touch ups and semi-annual full color treatments, my dandruff gradually went from sometimes to frequently to incessant. My scalp started itching at all hours and I could feel a fiery burn where there was the most dandruff and itchiness. The back of my ears (where my glasses go behind my ear all &amp; all the way past that to my lobe where earrings go) became scaly [plaque is the medical term], lightly pus/moistened (like it felt slick &amp; wet but didn&#x27;t feel oily, and smelled like pus) and smelled infected.     The regular use of my Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo felt great and stopped the burning itch... until my hair/scalp was dry and no longer wet from washing and then - voila, return of the fiery burningflaking itch!  Some times, my hair would be wet, but scalp had dried and the burn was back!  It was so bad, I started waking up aware that I had subconsciously scratched and peeled my scalp and back of ears bloody in my sleep and the skin was still flaking off! I started noticing my outer ear canal also starting to flake and peel. Sounds disgusting right? I was desperate to rectify the situation!  I have since gone au naturale - beauty is not worth the horrible flaking, burning and (what felt like) spreading skin condition and the flaking/scratching/shedding everywhere.    Search for a cure/relief:  I attempted to try a tea tree oil, plantain oil infused scalp spray; frangipani and then a morrocan oil treatment - none of them worked too well. As soon as my scalp dried after these treatments, it went right back to fiery burning please-rip-the-skin-off-so-it-won&#x27;t-burn-and-itch-no-more supreme discomfort.  I think they had a very minimal effect, but not enough to alleviate my condition in any sense.      I asked my primary care physician what could be done to alleviate the feeling and useless doctor that they were diagnosed it as seborrheic dermatitis and said there really isn&#x27;t any remedy other than frequent cleaning and moisturizing.  If and when I develop bloody, pus-filled sores and wounds, then they&#x27;d be able to help. So I was thinking OMG, great, now which of the million products on the market will truly clean (without over-stripping) and moisturize my poor scalp??  I certainly didn&#x27;t want to ever get to that crazy bloody skin-rotting-looking stage!!!    Finding JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo [Rosemary, Neem, Tea Tree 12oz]:  Desperately searching the market for a natural shampoo with sulfur (which something about hair color treatments strip from your head), tea-tree or other natural recommended moisturizing oils, and other wholesome goodness (because I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with the products from Sally&#x27;s, Walmart, Target, Whole Foods), I stumbled upon Jason Natural Costemics Dandruff Relief Shampoo on Amazon.  Two uses of this shampoo STOPPED the burning and excess flaking and scaliness of my scalp and helped alleviate some of the burning feeling also on the back of my ears.    This is not to say this product is a miracle shampoo; I still have some mild itchiness at the places were I had the worse case of burning/itchiness and depending on how much I sweated during the recent heat waves, I had buildup and plaque (which of course scratchy fingers that they are now accustomed scratched off) , but it is back to a very, very mild and privately manageable level.  No more embarrassing giant flakes, no more shedding as I turned my head, no more burning, no more wake up in the middle of the night with my pillow covered in little/big/round flakes, no more blood under my fingernails, and no visible shedding everywhere!  I can actually toss my hair now and not expect to see GIANT flakes (as extreme as say, pieces as wide as my pinky nail) fall on my desk, arms and shoulders.  Prior to the exacerbation from the color treatments, my scalp (especially the hairline near my forehead) would be visibly flake-y and would occasionally fall off onto my shoulders and desk by itself or when I rubbed my forehead.  Now no flakes fall unless I choose to put my nails to my scalp and scratch it off myself; heck, since there&#x27;s not even the slightest irritation, there really isn&#x27;t even that anymore!    My ears are still itchy, the plaque (flakiness/peeling) is still present, the inside of my ears still get a bit of flaky build-up, but the condition overall is vastly improved (especially the scalp!!!) compared to where it was before I started using this product.  I find the use of my conditioner tends to make my scalp itchier than when I just cut it out or use the all natural tea tree oil spray conditioner. I&#x27;ve started mixing JASON shampoo treatments in between my Head &amp; Shoulder shampoo (as JASON is very low-suds and I find I haveto use more than a quarter-sized dollop to get it spread/suds up my scalp &amp; hair) and once you get used to JASON you&#x27;ll be surprised how even 1/3 of the amount of your regular shampoo (in my case, H&amp;S) is like 10x foamier than JASON.  Also the smell? I have used Selsum Blue and it smells similar to Selsum Blue people; actually Selsum Blue smells stronger than this does. It makes me wonder if the people complaining about the smell ever even used Selsum Blue because if they had they wouldn&#x27;t complain about how \\&quot;bad\\&quot; it smelled.  Personally I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great when my scalp has a flare up. The sulfur odor tends to linger for several hours after I shampoo, but I don&#x27;t think other people notice it. And the results are well-worth that price!</li>
            <li> Product does not work at all.. Don&#x27;t waste your money... Also  The shampoo stinks like a wet dog after you use it.. I had to use   A conditioner to mask the stench...</li>
            <li> I can not emphasize enough how dramatically this shampoo works. I have tried so many different brands and different things to control and clear away my dandruff. All these brand name shampoos (Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue, etc) work by just taking care of symptoms and generally leave you worse off after you stop using their product.&lt;br /&gt; JASON dandruff shampoo is by far the best thing I have ever put on my head. I use it once a week, sometimes twice if I get really dirty and sweaty that week, and it clears my head for an entire week!!!! I see no dandruff for the first couple days and just a fleck here and there afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. Buy it. Try it. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t seem to find the conditioner to go with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it been AMAZING for my dandruff but my hair feels and looks healthier. I kid you not when I say people ask me what shampoo and conditioner I use after I started using this product because my hair was shinier and silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo just once or twice and discovered my face felt amazingly smooth and refreshed and tight all day.  My scalp too but the benefits of my facial skin was even better.  Since then my dandruff problem has been completely licked.  Meanwhile I started using this stuff each morning on my face.  Its gentle enough to not burn and the minty smell is harsh at first but becomes pleasant to start the day with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can activate the salicylic acid and sulfur by applying the shampoo to your pre-rinsed face.  Then let it dry 10-15 minutes and then rub in some water again for a second activation.  You can continue activating it to get deeper skin tightening and peels and really stretch its use.  The 2% acid is so low that a dime shaped amount can not do any harm except to those dead skin cells.  Just don&#x27;t use when perspiring.  It will go into your pores and activate in there leaving larger pore pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used at night but is rather harsh to leave on while sleeping.  My skin prefers a good 15 minute treatment in the morning.  Its like a lift and a tightener and a softener at the same time.  Worth trying!  You Jason guys should really market this as a facial product.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for a while. When my seborrheic dermatitis flares up, Jason always saves the day.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, I suffer from Seb Dermatitis and this has completely eliminated my dandruff.  My scalp is clear and healthy!  I used this shampoo every day for the first week and now use it every other.  No flakes, no itch, no more embarrassment wearing black.  Very pleased with the product and will continue purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium S-curls and my hair is frizzy. This shampoo makes my hair thicker, less frizzy and if I don&#x27;t brush my hair after a shower the shampoo creates strong, firm curls. I don&#x27;t use it for medicinal purposes but it does make my scalp feel invigorated when I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
            <li> This was the first dandruff shampoo I ever tried. One bottle lasted me over a year because I only shampoo with this once or twice every week. When I finally used it all up I decided to try Head and Shoulders because I didn&#x27;t want my hair smelling like sulfur anymore. After 2 weeks of using Head and Shoulders my scalp started itching like crazy. I was afraid I had lice but that wasn&#x27;t the case. My head started itching again because Head and Shoulders did nothing to control my dandruff. After that I bought Selsun Blue but that didn&#x27;t help. I then bought Coal Tar shampoo but that didn&#x27;t help either. I finally bought this nasty smelling Jason shampoo again and after a week the itching had finally went away. After trying literally almost every dandruff shampoo on the market, this Jason dandruff shampoo is the only one that works for me.   The active ingredients in this shampoo include sulfur and salicylic acid, both of which are known for controlling dandruff. The downside to putting sulfur in your hair is that it smells really bad. I suggest using a conditioner with fragrance after applying the shampoo to minimize the smell. Also if you have never used this shampoo before, I suggest using it every other day for the first 2 weeks. After that you can start using it once every week like me and it does a perfect job of preventing the dandruff itch from coming back. It is important to remember to leave the shampoo in your hair for about 2 minutes before rinsing it out to let it do its job.</li>
            <li> Son has psoriasis and says it works well.</li>
            <li> Since having my second baby, my hair has been kind of out of whack. Besides falling out all around the crown, I all of a sudden had a dandruff problem. (I have thick, curly hair and have never really had a problem with dandruff). In my efforts to move towards more natural products, I found this shampoo, read the reviews, and decided to give it a go. I really wanted to like this shampoo, but ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair has been a greasy mess, even when I use it without conditioner. I would probably have been willing to stick with the shampoo just for it&#x27;s natural aspects except for the fact that ever since I started using it, any sterling silver necklaces and earrings that I wear become oxidized. Not sure what it is in this that does that (if anyone knows, I would be grateful if you commented, so I can steer clear of it for next time), but I pretty much have to polish my silver jewelry every time I wear it if I want it to be shiny...never had that problem until now. So, now the search is on for a natural shampoo that keeps my curls looking good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and my jewelry oxidized. Suggestions?</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this shampoo. The scent is not as strong as other dandruff shampoos (though it does have a distinct scent, it is not unpleasant like other shampoos we&#x27;ve tried), and she noticed a significant difference after the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> Okay, at first I had no idea what anyone was talking about when it came to just how effective this was. I got through a good bit of the bottle and felt really underwhelmed, since other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried had at least shown SOME effect by then. I also didn&#x27;t notice much of any smell, which people claim is incredibly strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all (and I&#x27;ve had some stinky dandruff shampoos), so I was worried I had a fake or a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one day I was reading back through the reviews to figure out where I could have gone wrong, and one person noted that the directions stated to leave the shampoo in for 2-3 minutes. I scrolled up and sure enough, the Amazon directions stated this. On the bottle, however, the directions don&#x27;t say anything about leaving it in for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So next time I showered, that&#x27;s what I did. The cool tingling sensation that built up over time was relaxing and amazing. I had also bought one of those scalp master brushes in order to help clear any existing buildup on my scalp and improve circulation, so I used that for the whole 3 minutes the shampoo was sitting in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a few weeks later, my dandruff began to clear and I&#x27;m on my way to a clean and healthy scalp! I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I went back and read those reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t really notice a smell, though. Maybe my sense of smell is really poor?</li>
            <li> , this dandruff controller really helped i saw results in 2 weeks. it is controlled but will not go away forever, n it kinds smells but not too badd. overall great product only one i have tried that actually works. now there is little to no flakes falling out of my hair rather than bigg chunky nasty stuff falling everytime i touch my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great and effective alternative to the coal tar and selenic? acid type dandruff and seberia fighting shampoos. When I use it daily it keeps these things under control and (for me anyway) actually works better. Fast delivery with this company.</li>
            <li> The Jason Dandruff relief I received had no neem or Tea tree oil, it didn&#x27;t even have the words on the front like the picture advertised. I bought it for the neem and tea .</li>
            <li> I have had awful dandruff since I can remember. I have tried all the garbage on the market including Neutrogena T-Gel and Head &amp; Shoulders.  Nothing worked - they are all filled with alcohol and dry out your scalp.  I took a risk to try this brand that I have never heard of because I got tired of having to wash my hair every single day with nothing working.  Well, to my surprise, THIS WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;When you use it, it makes your head feel quite tingly. The next day I had NO signs of dandruff. I believe I have just found my new  (and only) shampoo!!  Recommended to everyone!  It really does work.</li>
            <li> Having had an itchy scalp and flakes for a year, I had tried everything to get rid of these problems.  Brand name anti-dandruff shampoos never worked well for very long so I tried all natural \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  But the apple cider vinegar just made my hair stink, the baking soda paste was messy, and the natural oils left my hair an oily mess.  So at the end of my wits and literally scratching my head as to what would stop the itch, I tried Jason shampoo after reading all of the positive reviews.  And to my surprise after 2 shampoos my head is no longer itchy.  It leaves your scalp feeling refreshed and cool and smelling much better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product.  He has been dealing with dandruff for a long time.  He used to use head shoulders.  I researched and got him him Jason&#x27;s as it has less additives and is more natural.  He could see the difference in few uses.  When he stops using this, however, dandruff comes back with a vengeance.  So far so good this product :-)</li>
            <li> I used H&amp;S for years.  This Jason shampoo got&lt;br /&gt;rid of my dandruff.  It takes a little time getting&lt;br /&gt;used to the smell, remember to wash it all off.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I wanted a natural product to use in place of T-Gel for my mild psoriasis.  It&#x27;s not as effective and I hated the smell while shampooing, which lingered long after my hair was dry.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once as it was way too smelly for me!!  Reminds me of the T/Gel smell.  The huge DANDRUFF display on the bottle doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> I finally found it.  Natural dandruff shampoo that is safe for color-treated hair.  This product works VERY well on my long, brown, straight hair - so well I think I&#x27;m a permanent convert from Head &amp; Shoulders (life-long user).  The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, and it&#x27;s worth putting up with for a healthy scalp (anyone with bad dandruff can attest to putting up with worse with the likes of Denorex or Neutrogena T/Gel).  And a simple solution is to use a pretty smelling conditioner!  I&#x27;m using Jason Jojoba conditioner at the moment, and it takes the edge off the clinical-sulfur-odor.  I&#x27;ve used just about EVERY dandruff remedy known to mankind, and I&#x27;m happy to report that my search is over. AMEN!</li>
            <li> Natural is misleading - check out the toxicity rating for this product by the Environmetnal Working Group: [...]    Gets the same rating as Selsun Blue: [...]</li>
            <li> Godsend! Won&#x27;t strip my keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a couple all-natural-esque products for dandruff and dry scalp and this by far has shown the best results, highly recommended.  no itching and no more dry flakes!</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase and and shipping</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I&#x27;ve had severe dandruff for over 20 years. I&#x27;m AA with 4b hair and this shampoo has allowed me to be dandruff free for up to 2 weeks after shampooing, versus having dandruff the day after washing for most of my life! The smell is strong but I use a scented conditioner so it doesn&#x27;t smell once my hair is styled.</li>
            <li> This product works great at controlling dandruff whilst making you smell like farts. The fast action dandruff control ingredients work quickly to manage flakey and itchy scalp, while additional ingredients work hard all day to keep you smelling like farts, even in the toughest conditions. Other dandruff shampoos smell like soap, so smelling like farts requires an additional step of farting on yourself continuously or the application of a separate perfume that smells like butts. With Jason Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, you get both in one, easy application; effective relief from even the worst dandruff, and a faint but constant fart smell that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I love Jason&#x27;s shampoos! They are affordable and work really well! This product smells great ... all of the oils in it are so good for you. This is a great alternative to all of the harsh chemicals in most shampoos. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this shampoo to treat my itchy scalp+dandruff after reading the reviews.  When the bottle came, I noticed that the bottle looked different and sure enough, they seemed to have updated the design and maybe formula of the shampoo as well?  It smells a bit on the bad side but I find it tolerable, not sure about the people around me.  But the main thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my itchy scalp.. may be made it even worse, but there is an improvement on the dandruff.  The shampoo also doesn&#x27;t lather too well so it&#x27;s hard to get it on your scalp evenly.  I don&#x27;t know, I will keep using it since I have it but probably will keep looking for a better shampoo.  Also, I have been leaving it on my scalp for 2-3 minutes every time.</li>
            <li> The sulfur is quite pungent.  The added fragrance actually makes it worse.  Even after rinsing and using a conditioner the scent lingers.  Your towels will also smell.</li>
            <li> I admired the smell out of the bottle when we first got this. I assumed that it would smell that way in your hair, too. So after about two weeks of use we&#x27;ve noticed that the dandruff problem has improved dramatically (much like if we had used a conventional dandruff shampoo). I&#x27;m happy with that, even elated. The smell in your hair is pretty bad. It&#x27;s very sulfur-y (an active ingredient). I joke with DH that we paid to get a water treatment system to take out the sulfur and missed the smell so we had to get this shampoo. We will keep getting it, though. The benefits (little or no dandruff) outweigh the problems with using a product laden with very toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and have been using it to avoid dandruff. I dont use it everyday but it has been working great! I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it every other day and my head does not itch anymore! I was using it everyday but decided to try it every other day and it works well. I tried all other brands of dandruff shampoo and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I used to have a bad case of itch in my skull! It was super frustrating! So i search for something online and came across this! I read the reviews and took my chance on this! This thing worked for me since the first use. I have finnaly felt like my skull and hair is under control with out any itch!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does its job. It got rid of the itching and most of the flaking after two uses, however, it STINKS! This product would be perfect for me if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad. This shampoo has sulphur in it. This is what causes the bad odor. Sulphur is know to be very effective in helping with scalp problems, but the smell is the price to pay. I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can put up with the smell of sulphur, then this would be a good product for controlling dandruff and other scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice now and my hair smells horrible!!!! I have had to wash my hair to get rid of this awful rubber smell at least 4 times now and my hair still has a hint of stinkiness! I do not reccomend this shampoo at all. My entire living room smelled like this product due to the smell emitting out of my scalp. It seriously made me and my kid nauseous! I never write bad reviews, but could not let anyone make the mistake of using this product.  I am definitely asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> It says there that it is the one with rosemary but they sent me the original one...without rosemary and other things</li>
            <li> I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.</li>
            <li> I think, for me, this won&#x27;t work in the long term. After I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I&#x27;ll be on the search for the next &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; solution. I&#x27;m not one to wash my hair every day as my hair texture doesn&#x27;t require that. The sulfur, in the product, needs to be masked and the dandruff control is pretty weak IMO.  It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Jason always makes great products but this dandruff shampoo makes your hair smell bad after use so i suggest u buy a good scented conditioner to go with this preferably by jason</li>
            <li> Ever since I moved to Southern California I&#x27;ve been struggling with dandruff (it might have something to do with the water but I am not sure). I have tried Sebulex, T Gel by Neutrogena, Head and Shoulders, Selsen Blue, Nizoral and a few others that I cannot remember and this shampoo tops them all. It has made this most noticeable difference in my dandruff epidemic and I am truly grateful. The shampoo does smell a little err different than what you would normally expect but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would definitely buy this shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is cruelty free. I also really like it is made with natural ingredients. It works well, but dry out the hair a bit so best if followed by some conditioner.</li>
            <li> THis product did not help me at all!. After using the whole bottle of shampoo, things were a bit worse for me. Went back to the doctors for his help.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a bottle of this magic shampoo when she noticed my &amp;#34;str-excema&amp;#34; (stress induced scalp insanity)... I&#x27;ve tried everything from more expensive holistic products to clinical strength, blue bottle varieties. This helped in one use, beyond amazing with 2 uses! Mind blown. In combination with Neem oil, I finally have a real solution to an embarrassing hairline issue. (Thick, flaky, uncontrollable sadness from ear to ear)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift, but I&#x27;ll be purchasing this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I needed a shampoo without sulfates/parabens.  Also, my scalp has been very itchy and dry and wanted to find a natural shampoo.  This does work to stop the itching/flakness, however, the smell is unbearable!  My hair does not feel clean.  It smells like I haven&#x27;t washed it in days and I only used it last night!  I keep smelling this horrible smell and it&#x27;s actually making my sinuses worse.  Maybe if I use this product again, I will shampoo with another shampoo after using it.  The smell feels very unclean to me.  I always use sulfate free shampoos/conditioners but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> Initially this smells like flea shampoo.  I actually thought I could get past that if it worked.  However, after drying my hair, it smelled like a combination of a junior high locker room and sulfur.  Absolutely horrible.  I avoided coming in contact with people all day because the scent was so pungent.  After washing my hair again with regular shampoo, the scent still lingers but is tolerable.  It&#x27;ll probably take a few washes.  Odor aside, my scalp still itches so this was a waste of time and money.  I won&#x27;t be trying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I have tried the Jason dandruff relief shampoo and conditioner combo and would recommend that.  My scalp didn&#x27;t itch and I didn&#x27;t need to avoid people after using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an effective dandruff-control shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp for years.  JASON shampoo gets rid of the flakes and doesn&#x27;t cause the skin irritation and painful zits that other products do, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> My son is allergic to a certain chemical found in most dandruff type shampoos and prescription shampoo had many side effects so I tried Jason natural dandruff shampoo. I worked to reduce his dermatitis without harsh chemicals and side effects!!</li>
            <li> I never really got shampoos. I still don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a dude. This shampoo is unlike any other I have used. It cleans my hair, better than any other. And it leaves my hair normal, not all frizzy/dry/squeaky. I have no reason ever look for another shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice. It does smell like any other dandruff shampoo, so don’t expect floral or fruity senses. It does the job. I like that it is organic oriented, which is why I bought it. The price is better than brands in a store, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african American and my hair is natural and very thick. I recently took out a sew in and before I took it out I purchased this dandruff shampoo because I knew when I&#x27;d take it out there would be plenty of dandruff. As always I was right and the shampoo did wonders on my hair my mom was soo shocked on how much dandruff was removed with one wash. I would definitely but again and recommend</li>
            <li> Thank you! It is great!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and my 7 year old daughter started itching her scalp and was diagnosed with sebhorrheic dermatitis.  I was a little apprehensive in ordering this because of the smell that people were complaining about.  It&#x27;s really not that bad at all.  We used Netrogena T-Gel, and that smell is much more pungent and would make our whole upstairs smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells like you walked into a hippie massage parlor.  Some foreign smells, but nothing bad.  There is a slight tinge of sulfur, but again, nothing that a conditioning treatment afterwards would not mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results are excellent, both my daughter and I are showing much improved signs, and not scratching even close to what we used to.  I&#x27;m curious to see how this holds up in the long run, as we&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think this gets rid of dandruff, but it helps make your scalp feel good.  It does soften my hair.</li>
            <li> First time using this product, not able to say one way or another just yet.</li>
            <li> So far this is working where others have failed I  very impressed I&#x27;ve had scalp issues all life and previously just rotated products but now I want sulfate free and this one has greatly improved o have psoriasis or bad dandruff or both it helps</li>
            <li> If this is where dog shampoo originated from, then I see why it&#x27;s always been somewhat expensive.  I tried it for a couple of days, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it reminded me of bathing my dog.  Mind you, it might not be a bad smell to some people, but to me I felt as though I was prepping myself to be roasted or taking a bath w/ my dog.</li>
            <li> Organic product. No harsh chemicals. Good for people like me with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> i have been suffering from scally scalp...i have tried everything under the sun. i am sold. this stuff is amazing. i no longer itch or have flaky scalp!!!! also, i find i do not have to wash as much ...my hair stays clean longer. i do not usually write reviews but havent been so impressed with a product as i am with this shampoo. it is a life saver!</li>
            <li> This shampoo barely lathers and it did not get rid of my flakes at all. The scent of it is just okay too.  It did not work for me, so I will not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> I had Seborrheic dermatitis and was given ketoconazole prescription shampoo, which was not working  for me at all. I finally came upon this after searching the internet and reading the reviews on Amazon. Genuinely happy with the product. Started by using it everyday and i am now on the second bottle in 3 month (bought the first one in Feb)s and have reduced it to 3X per week. The itchiness is almost gone and slowly i am beginning to see fewer of the pimples or boils on my scalp. Hardly get one or two.I would have so many that it was painful to comb my hair. Different shampoos might work for different people but this one was definitely for me and my condition and so just wanted to thank the makers of this awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic derm and this shampoo seems to be helping but through this long process of dealing with SD for 4 years I am realizing that when something works it seems to not work later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stil have scale but my scalp is looking like it is getting more pink than red. The sulfur smell is strong but who cares. If it is helping it is helping.</li>
            <li> I need a sulfate free shampoo because of a the infusium hair treatment (like a keratin treatment) which I had done. I do not like the smell of this shampoo, it smells medicine-like. I didn&#x27;t think it gave a real deep cleaning which I need because I do get mild dandruff sometimes. While it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep cleaning, it also really tangled my long hair and made it really difficult to comb out -even with a lot of smoothing conditioner in my hair, before I rinse it out. Compared to Head and shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but I will keep using it until I find a sulfate free shampoo with Zinc in it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products for my hair and this one takes care of my scalp.  I would recommend this to anyone who has scalp and hair issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always had mild dandruff. Now that she&#x27;s a tween, it bothers her more than it used to. She started using Head &amp; Shoulders, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything. So we switched to this one. She&#x27;s used it a couple times a week until the bottle was gone (maybe 6 weeks), and there is a definite improvement. There is still a bit of dandruff here and there, but not like there used to be (brush and braid her hair nightly, so I get a chance to take a good look). It seems like this shampoo is really healing the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it does smell strongly of something that reminds me of eucalyptus or menthol. Not bad, but strong. I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was recommended by the pharmacist. i had some dandruff and was using medicated shampoo. He suggested trying this one. Tried this shampoo and it worked so fast!</li>
            <li> It worked right away.  In just a day or two, the problem was solved.  I used it for a week to make sure, but it didn&#x27;t come back.  And I had a VERY itchy scalp before buying this.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS.  Will definitely be buying more.  My hair and scalp feel better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  Yes it has a little sulphur smell, but the shampoo itself smells like tea.  Doesn&#x27;t bother a guy with short hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me...still had dandruff.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that stop my dandruff, well not actually stopped but almost reduced it to nothing, very recommended shampoo.</li>
            <li> This resolved my issue with dandruff when no other product would. I use it in a three-day rotation with a pyrithione zinc shampoo on day two and a tea tree oil shampoo on day three. I haven&#x27;t seen a flake in over a year.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that has ever stopped my flaking. I tried eveything, this was going to be my last attempt before seeing a doctor for prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now 100% flake free because of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of JASON products. I accidentally bought this instead of the 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that I love so much. This however has such an unpleasant stench to it. I took two more showers after using this today and I still can&#x27;t get the stink off. Maybe the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is intentional, after all people buy patchouli on purpose, right? I didn&#x27;t check other reviews to see if this was intended, but I cannot handle it. I was going to return it, but my wife threw it away immediately. Worst part was, this is a two pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  One thing I find interesting is there&#x27;s no ingredients list on the bottle, and no directions either.  It lists two &#x27;active ingredients&#x27;, but the rest of the recipe is a mystery I guess.  Some people hate the smell, so let me describe my experience with the smell: The main smell that you&#x27;ll notice right away is like Pepto Bismol.  If you pay closer attention, you&#x27;ll also smell an undertone that I would describe as something like the fragrance of Ivory soap.  When I really concentrate on the smell I also get a small whiff of something that reminds me of insect repellent.  Overall I think the smell is fine - it&#x27;s way less offensive than competing dandruff shampoos like the Neutrogena coal tar and the other one I don&#x27;t remember the name of (the one that has some kind of anti-fungal agent).  I&#x27;ve never noticed the smell remaining on my hair after I rinse and condition.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks the condition of my scalp improved greatly using this product. I was using Aveda anti-dandruff shampoo for about 4 years but it stopped working and my scalp was starting to get dry and flakey again. I wanted something without a high chemical content and have liked other Jason products. I don&#x27;t think it smells any better or worse than Head &amp; Shoulders but I think it works a lot better. I do have to use a conditioner since this product strips the hair quite a bit (I&#x27;m a little worried about what it&#x27;s going to do when I get my hair colored again). It is typical with most dandruff shampoos that the focus is on the scalp but doesn&#x27;t necessarily help the rest of the hair. I&#x27;ve kept using the Aveda Anti-Dandruff conditioner and the combination seems to work well though I may seek out a no rinse conditioner to go over the ends of my hair. I am giving it 4 stars mostly because of what it&#x27;s done for my scalp so it delivers on that as advertised.</li>
            <li> cleaned my hair but did not help with intense scaling that came suddenly out of nowhere.  on advice of a dermatologist i got Neutrogena T-Sal which, when combined with prescription Betamethasone steroid gel (dries without residue), has 99% cured my previously uncontrollable seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Nothing really clears up scalp psoriasis . Shampoos &amp; creams can make it feel better for awhile. .  I was surprised Jason made my scalp feel &amp; look better when I first tried it. But like all the others, I have to alternate shampoos because it seems they don&#x27;t work if you keep using them everyday or every other day. The smell to me is not that strong . It smells a bit like sulfur. But I am having better luck with the natural/ organic products.</li>
            <li> We have hard water and I take super hot showers, so my scalp was getting a little dried out. This was the fifth and only shampoo that worked to get my head mosturized. I love it!!! The smell is more earthy but still good. But worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as good as the conditioner and dandruff shampoo in one. That one smells great and works. This may work but the smell is vomit inducing at times. Hard to explain, smells good in bottle and while you apply. Almost peppermint like. Rinse off.... Fine. As it dries the odor changes to something I can&#x27;t explain. Lingers on forever and on hands. Smells like you cracked open a freshly toasted pumpkin seed x100 potency. This potency makes it almost nauseating border line vomit inducing, not so bad if you have short hair but my hair is very long and its worse. Not to mention when you workout or sweat the smell comes out so strong people around you can smell it and let me tell you... It smells horrible.</li>
            <li> okay, so i have come to the very specific description of the &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; i have mentioned: it&#x27;s like dog shampoo mixed with mouthwash.  that it what it smells like to me.  that being said, it does feel good on the scalp, although it&#x27;s consistency was much more like conditioner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband.  His bedroom was starting to smell like his head.  Problem gone, great product. Will definitely be buying again and for my sons. I just reordered.  It works well on dandruff as well as making the room smell nice.</li>
            <li> this is the best treatment because this cures me the dandruff and until now never appears again!!  I prove a lot of products along all my life, but this is the ONLY ONE CAN KILLS DANDRUFF hehehehe really!! always i will use it!</li>
            <li> Jason, whoever you are... You are my savior. Had wicked flakes and balding since I joined the nuclear Navy in 2006. Now after less than a week my head stopped itching and no more flakes. Thank you! I am beyond satisfied minus the god awful toilet bowl cleaner smell.</li>
            <li> This is currently the only shampoo I use in my hair.... it has basically eliminated all of the flakes from the hair and my dry itchy scalp! My holy grail hair product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my scalp problem. Sorry</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with dandruff and dried out my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> beware! my hair and scalp was left smelling like horrible sulfur for days!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after trying numerous products. He had what is called smelly hair syndrome and dandruff. No matter how often he washed his hair, the smell would come right back. Everything I got him didn&#x27;t work. I finally stumbled upon the reviews for Jason dandruff shampoo and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try too. I&#x27;m so happy I did! It has gotten rid of the smell and the dandruff. This is the ONLY shampoo I will buy for him from here on out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked well. I used it on my head and face, when i shower. It removed a lot of dry skin around my nose and eyebrows. That has always been a problem for since i was a kid. Good stuff, try it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products. This one really works. Finally, I have relief from an itchy scalp and the white gunk build up. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff for close to two decades and thought it was something that could only be cured with a special prescription shampoo. Well, I was wrong. This shampoo got rid of all my dandruff after the first go. Buy it. It is nice to finally not have to worry about all those huge flakes. This thing is a life changer. Also my girlfriend says it smells like dog shampoo. I agree, the smell is pretty bad, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt really that strong...definitely not as strong as Selson or that other tar based one, Denorex or whatever its called.  This smells like guys organic products usually do.  It washes out just fine, lathers well too.  Cuts the dandruff instantly, but you probably have to use this every two days.</li>
            <li> When you suffer from skin ailments, your desperate for relief of the symptoms. I bought this shampoo and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I think I spent around $15. Not worth it. Stick with the T-Sal.</li>
            <li> I have a teenager with big flaked dandruff.  Using this shampoo you would never know he had it. Love that it is all natural.  Smells great and really works!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair smelled terrible during hot weather, even right after washing it.  The sulfer in this product has eliminated the bad odor when other tricks (tea tree, lavender, vinegar, etc.) could not.  So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Fire and brimstone is correct. This stuff made my hair smell like a hot springs, it did dissipate a little with the conditioner i used. Made my hair be a little weird. My dandruff levels decreased and the itchiness definitely went down after a week of consistent use.</li>
            <li> I ordered by mistake before I read the ingredient Iist and then was unable to cancel it. So I guess I will be receiving it, paying for it, then throwing it away. So be careful if you are wheat or gluten sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son he has bad dandruff almost like cradle cap (he is 7) and it works great on him.  My only complaint is the smell but I will buy it again because it works.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works great feels great.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Takes the itching and dermititis away but your hair will really smell like sulfur; worth it if you want to keep it under control. I have a mild case of scalp dermititis so I use it once a week but you can use as needed for more severe cases.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin and dandruff issues all of my life.  After reading other reviews about this product, I gave it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past couple of years.  It cuts down on my issues about 80%.</li>
            <li> I have on and off fungal infections. This product works well to fight dandruff, but I still need to occasionally use prescription strength shampoo to get rid of the fungus. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Oh sweet Jesus. I have rewashed my hair 3 times and I still smell like a fart factory. This is the worst shampoo I have ever encountered. My hair got crazy greasy and I stink. Lame lame lame. I am actually going to contact them about a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with this.  No matter how much I rinse, my wet hair feels sticky.  When it dries, it has a sticky film.  I could live with the medicinal smell if it left my hair feeling clean.  I&#x27;m tossing what is left and looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with an itchy scalp with hair loss for years.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products.  The one that finally took my flakes away was Salicylic Acid.  Nothing has taken the itch away except extreme diet changes (no sugars, gluten or dairy).  When I bought this shampoo and used it my flakes came back.  I was bummed.  If you respond well to Salicylic Acid, this product is probably not what you need.</li>
            <li> long story short - it just works ! seems expensive but its worth. use it every other day and my dandruffs disappaered.</li>
            <li> Finally! It worked! I have tried everything that is available at Wal-Mart and a product from the doctor and none of it really worked. This worked the even after the first wash. So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair. I used to use head &amp; shoulder and that would work sometimes, but generally, no matter what shampoo, my hair would go through cycles of an itchy dry scalp on a monthly basis. I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 9 months and I have no more flakes. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry and my hair isn&#x27;t greasy at the end of the day. Strong smell, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Just like all others who suffer from dandruff, we have tried it all. Listerine, Head and Shoulder&#x27;s, Aveda, Oatmeal, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JASON Natural has been the only thing that has kept my dandruff in control. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sulfur or the rosemary, but after years of trying product after product (even the nice sulfate-free ones), this has been my saving grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT suggest using this shampoo more than 2-3 times a week as you may end up irritating your scalp. If you do suffer from an excessively oily scalp and find it necessary to shampoo every day, I suggest that you use a solution of baking soda and water in between washes with JASON natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smell: even as a woman, I really like the smell, as it&#x27;s not too floral, but rather has a strong herbal scent (medicinal to some).</li>
            <li> Good stuff, used it 2 times so far, seems to be helping the dandruff, still have some flakes so hopefully it even works better with time.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from severe burning and itching scalp for years also and have not been able to find any help. I too have spent so much money on Salon products - which would help for a day at most.  I am so excited and relieved to have found this product!! The reviewer above is right in saying that the smell is not the greatest... but its not the worst either and Iam definitely willing to put up with it b/c of the relief its given me.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS PRODUC!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I have ever used to treat my dandruff.  My scalp was the absolutely worst; very dry, flaky, and unsitely.. and most of all itchy.  No oil could cure it, but oil would only make it worse and weigh my hair down.  This shampoo got rid of the problem on the first wash; I have NEVER had that with any other shampoo or natural remedy (such as vinegar).  I am more than excited about this product and I hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find a natural shampoo for my issue.  I have previously purchased brands made by P&amp;G, Unilver, etc. and found they were not very effective.  Jason&#x27;s has worked well, especially at helping with itching.  I did not find the smell to be bothersome or over powering but I kind of like the sulfur smell.  I do apply other hair products when styling my hair and they seem to cover up the smell.  I find that I really like Neutrogena T-Gel the best of all the brands that I have tried.  This certainly does not smell any worse than that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally care to write reviews on Amazon, nor have I had a terrible experience with them but this product ROCKS! I am not even kidding when I say I used it ONCE... like twenty minutes ago and I can already tell it is working! I can see a difference in how dry my scalp is and while shampooing my hair, I could actually feel it tingling my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it is not to shabby for the price! I have always had a really dry scalp and just recently it has gotten worse so I continued my search for a cheaper, non-chemically loaded type shampoo that would work for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I previously bought a Maple Holistics Lavender and Almond Oil shampoo that did absolutely nothing for my head.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this product smells. Get over it! It&#x27;s not that bad and quite frankly if it clears up the dryness on my scalp, I don&#x27;t care! I have been getting so worried about wearing dark shirts/coats that I just always ended up wearing a beanie. That&#x27;s not how someone should live dealing with a dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!! If the smell is really that big of a problem, then you probably should just continue having the dry, itchy, flaky, embarrassing scalp... That sounds like fun. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give the product 5 stars, but I want to see long term how this helps... so to be continued!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll even update this review in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Finding Jason products saved my scalp from the torture of winter air. Unlike other products I have tried, this shampoo is perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong sulfur smell! The smell was so bad that I only used it once. So in fairness, it may work great for dandruff and itch. I&#x27;ll never know. My husband got in bed next to me that night and said, &amp;#34;Baby, your hair stinks&amp;#34;. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Is that fire and brimstone?  Nope.  That&#x27;s just my hair.    I developed seborrheic dermatitis behind my right ear and a small patch on the left, top side of my head.  I thought I was becoming a lizard person because my body was regenerating scales like crazy.  Then there&#x27;s the itching...oh...the itching.  Did I mention I have long, black hair?  That means that the seborrheic dermatitis is really attractive and makes me look so well groomed.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;    I&#x27;ve been prescribed steroid foams and creams, and nothing really worked.  I was left with my lizard-like alien patches of skin.  I called my dermatologist to get an appointment because I was fed up, only to be told that their next appointment wasn&#x27;t available for over 3 weeks.  What&#x27;s a girl to do?  Duh...jump on Amazon and look at reviews for products related to dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis.      This shampoo popped up to the top of my search results.  I read the reviews.  Most people agreed that the stuff worked, but smelled bad.  Some said it dried their hair out, others felt it didn&#x27;t clean well enough.  Well....here&#x27;s my assessment.      My hair falls below my shoulder blades, is black, and is a coarse mix of wavy and curls on the worst day.  Without good conditioner, it&#x27;s a mess.  It also absorbs smells like crazy.  If I go to a hibachi restaurant, I smell like a hibachi restaurant until I shampoo my hair.    I used this shampoo and told myself the smell wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  When it&#x27;s wet, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as bad as when it dries.  When my hair dried, it smelled like sulfur.  It smelled like fire and brimstone exploded on my head.  The upside is, as one reviewer said, after one shampoo, the scaliness was far less severe.  I muscled myself through a second shampoo...the results were even better.  My hair still smells like sulphur, but my scalp isn&#x27;t falling apart anymore.      The downside, besides the smell is that my hair is a mess of frizziness.  I&#x27;m now trying a hybrid approach where I&#x27;m conditioning all the hair except for my direct scalp.  My conditioner is all natural and helps tone the fire and brimstone smell down a bit.    Because my hair is long, I can smell the sulphur.  I agree with one of the other reviewers--if you&#x27;re a guy with short hair, this will be a great product because your hair won&#x27;t be near your nose.  If you have longer hair, tread with caution.  I&#x27;m wondering if I use this stuff every other shampoo if the results will stick.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that I need to write this review, because of all the confusing reviews on Amazon.  Second I seriously considered doing a video review to show exactly how to use this video, but first that would be a little weird, and second I don&#x27;t have any water proof video equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this even after reading 20+ reviews on it because of one person who said it worked, and how.  so now it is my turn to return the favor.  for background, I am 34 years old, and have had severe dandruff since I was in 4th grade or so.  I&#x27;ve tried every single product I could get my hands on to resolve this issue, it has been so bad, that I can scratch my head with a hairbrush and get enough scalp flakes to make several \\&quot;ant hills\\&quot; out of them on the floor.  I am not joking, or kidding, nor is it that amusing, actually kind of scary.  I could scratch my head all day, for weeks and it would keep flaking off.  some flakes were the size of two side by side benadryl pills or slightly larger, on up to pieces the size of a small lima bean, I&#x27;m not talking pepper flake sized, or grain of sand, these were large sections of my scalp flaking off.  This product is the only thing that has made this stop, and I&#x27;ve never been so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first I&#x27;ll cover the smell, then I&#x27;ll cover how to use it to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor from this product is a distinct Sulfur Odor, is VERY strong, WILL make your clothes, hairbrush, even fingers smell like sulfur, even 2 days after you last washed your hair!  I recommend getting a body spray from bath and body works that you like, and spray your hair with it until the smell goes away.  That is right, I said \\&quot;GOES AWAY\\&quot;  the smell is created by a chemical reaction between the shampoo and your scalp.  if your scalp is affected by the bacteria that causes the flaking, then it will react with the shampoo and cause the odor.  When all the bacteria is dead, the odor does NOT occur. note, the bacteria will come back, see the directions below for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You will need to take a shower!  (unless you like to wash your hair in a sink...)&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash your face first&lt;br /&gt;3. rinse your face&lt;br /&gt;4. use this shampoo to wash your hair, use PLENTY of it.  my hair is about 3 inches long and I use about the same amount as the size of a Hershey Kiss.  You want it to lather up a bit and cover your entire scalp, you need to massage it into your scalp with your finger tips.  do this for a good 30 seconds or so (yes this will make you fingers stink like sulfur for a while (I think 6 or 7 hand washings should get rid of the smell...)&lt;br /&gt;5. do NOT rinse your hair!&lt;br /&gt;6. take the rest of your shower with the shampoo in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;7. if you shave your legs do this too with the shampoo in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;8. if you use a washcloth or loofah, rinse it out really good when you are done, with the shampoo in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;9. I hope you understand the point is to keep the shampoo in your hair!  I mean 5+ minutes, after about 3 you can just barely feel the cool tea tree feeling, barely.  It doesn&#x27;t get much stronger than that, I think the tea tree is a very small component in this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;10. hopefully you are still keeping the shampoo in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;11. when you just cannot stand it any longer you can rinse your hair. 3-7 minutes works best.&lt;br /&gt;12. repeat daily until the sulfur smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sulfur smell goes away, you can alternate between this shampoo and your normal (or other special shampoo, ie for oily hair, or for color treated hair, or for dry hair, or whatever else you normally use.)  You will want to use Jason&#x27;s shampoo every other day for half as long as it took to get rid of the smell (it took me 10-12 days before the smell went away, so I did every other day for the next 6 days).  After those days are up, you can use Jason&#x27;s Shampoo 1 time every 3 days and your normal shampoo the other times.  If you do not wash your hair every day, add a no washday in there (change every other to 1 out of 3 days, and change 1 out of 3 days to 1 out of 5 days using your normal shampoo the other times you do wash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you start to smell sulfur again, or have any itching, then go back to step one and repeat the entire process again.  I am on week 3 right now, and have not had ANY problems.  I no longer smell like sulfur, I did have to buy a new hair brush (no idea if the smell faded or not on it&#x27;s own).  And I tried several different things before I found a way to cover the smell coming from my hair (fyi, other people can smell it from 4 feet away!!  or further depending on the breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you can understand that you have to deal with a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; (pretty bad one at that) to get rid of a serious issue that has been affecting you for who knows how long, then this product is for you.  if you have normal dandruff issues that come and go, by pass this product and use whatever works for you and does not smell.  This product is for people who want to get rid of these problems and cannot find any other way.  It is also cheaper than a doctor.  If you have gobs and gobs of hair you may need to use gobs and gobs of this shampoo.  I am not a scientist, but I understand how bacteria grows.  You probably need to make sure this stuff covers ALL of your hair until the smell goes away the first time.  It would be easier to get a short hair cut and then let it grow back out.  After all isn&#x27;t a couple of years of growing your hair out worth getting rid of flakes forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, every human&#x27;s body is different.  I am sorry if this does not work for you after following my directions.  I have have been so happy I found my self crying sometimes.  I grew up with flaky hair and it had a serious affect on my self esteem and my social skills.  I doubt I can repair any of that now, but I feel much better about myself and have even stopped checking for flakes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had flaky dandruff, but I&#x27;ve had a constantly itchy, irritated scalp for many years. I finally decided to do something about it and found this online. I like that it&#x27;s free of many not-so-good ingredients, and the reviews seemed promising. I apply this at the roots and leave it one for a couple minutes. After the first application, the itchiness on my scalp was gone! I use it two or three times a week, and it works wonderfully each time.  I have straight, long hair and it does dry out my ends a little, so right after I apply this at my roots, I also put deep conditioner on my ends. After a couple minutes, I rinse both products out of my hair, and I&#x27;m done. With the conditioner on at the same time, my ends come out nice and soft. The smell of the shampoo didn&#x27;t bother me when I first tried it, and I&#x27;ve actually found that I&#x27;ve come to like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard. It&#x27;s just ok at keeping it flake free in the winter. Works good in any other season, But whats that matter huh? There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell bad all day but is very effective. Sometimes I use it when head and shoulders isn&#x27;t doing the trick but only when I&#x27;m desperate.</li>
            <li> Does this product work? Yes, I think it really works well. Flakes? What flakes? But thing is, this has a VERY strong smell. I ended up using this once a week on the weekends so that I only had to make my immediate family suffer through the smell with me. You can air yourself out some, but in any enclosed space, you will smell kind of funny. Personally, I didn&#x27;t think it was a BAD smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is my favorite smell in the world. So if your head is super itchy from the flakes and you don&#x27;t mind smelling like some essential oils, this may help.</li>
            <li> I really like Jason products, body wash etc.  I like this product as well, but it does smell kind of strong. Not a fabulous smell, BUT it&#x27;s better than being itchy and/or flakey. I don&#x27;t use it daily, nor do I wash my hair daily. I use it once per week and it does a great job at getting rid of itchy flakey scalp issues. I&#x27;m pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at my local natural market a few weeks ago for about $11. This stuff fixed my dandruff overnight. Literally overnight! I went from a snow factory to flake-free and itch-free; and stayed that way for almost a week before washing with it again. You don&#x27;t need to wash often with this for it to work, and you can alternate with another shampoo. It worked so well on my scalp that I tried it on my face (my beard had some dandruff issues as well) and once again I had overnight results. This worked better for my beard than Beard Oil. It&#x27;s also helped leave my hair softer and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I personally have with it is the smell. Before you wash with it, it has a nice herbal aroma. Afterwards though, it leaves a smell that for me personally is akin to hair that&#x27;s been borderline burnt by a hair dryer. I don&#x27;t know if its the oils, herbs, the sulfer, or a mix of the former, but at times I catch a whiff of the smell and it&#x27;s displeasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the speed and persistence of its effectiveness, I think a weird smell is not that big of a deal. I found this shampoo not only to be great against dandruff, but better at nourishing my hair than the other JASON shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This stuff is worth every single penny, especially if you need immediate and long-lasting relief. You don&#x27;t even need to use much when you wash your hair, so the bottle will last longer than you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dandruff and I have tried a lot of different shampoos. This has had the greatest positive effect by far.</li>
            <li> Very soothing + smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many shampoos smell is just overpowering + gives me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s smell is fairly mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some problems over the past two winters that got really bad during this year&#x27;s long, long, looooooong winter. We avoid chemicals and synthetics as much as possible in our home, and I bought this on a whim one day, dubious but hopeful. PLEASANT SURPRISE! With the first use, the flakes on my scalp had cleared up considerably and the itch was gone. As others have noted, it does have a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and reminds me of salons I went to when I was much younger (though I&#x27;m certain those salons were relying rather heavily on synthetic fragrances!). The one real downside with this shampoo is that it weighs my hair down a good deal. Not my favorite look, but I&#x27;ve gotten into a rhythm of using this 1-2x/week and sometimes following with my regular shampoo and conditioner combo, which keeps my scalp healthy and my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first JASON product I&#x27;d used and I would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> i got this shampoo for smelly hair syndrome i thought i had. I was skeptical at first but this product does work, my hair stop smelling after 2 days. You need to use a good amount cause it does not get soapy just like conditioner. For me i didn&#x27;t even smell a hint of sulfur, i cant explain the smell but it is not a repulsive smell but just a unique smell.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, I will give the seller that. But the product itself just simply was not good. It smells very strong, which is to be expected as it has sulfur in it. But add to that the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really lather well, and for me, even though I used it for a couple weeks going exactly by directions, it did not work on dandruff. Really was not worth it. Again, that&#x27;s not the sellers fault but the manufacturer, but if you really need to get rid of flakes don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo to buy! My husband has very severe dandruff and we tried every brand on the shelf at the stores as well as prescription. Nothing worked. I then started researching and found that his PH balance was off possibly causing the problem. I found this product and decided that the ingredients should get his scalp back to normal. Within 2 weeks his dandruff was gone! He uses once a week to maintain and hasn&#x27;t had a problem for over 2 years. No more itching or embarrassing flakes. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There are scientific studies that validate the use of tea tree oil for the treatment of dandruff.  This product combines that treatment with two other traditional treatments for dandruff, colloidal sulfur and salicylic acid.  What I really like about this product is the combination of herbal oils in the product.  The herbal oils reduce the smell of the sulfur (I actually like the smell of this shampoo) and provide a soothing effect on the scalp.  I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective at treating my dandruff while being just a pleasant and soothing product.  It definitely seems to control my dandruff better than products like Head and Shoulders that don&#x27;t contain the antifungal properties of tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ve used it just about daily over the last 9 months and I&#x27;m on my third bottle.  Like the title to this review says, \\&quot;Highly Recommended.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have had uncontrollable dandruff for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and nothing has worked.  This shampoo worked the very first time I used it.  I hardly saw a single flake after I washed my hair.  I will continue to use this and have even recommended it to other people.  Buy this shampoo!!  It even has a great smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t do the job and i only have mild dandruff. Do yourself a favor if you want to go the natural root and just add a drop of tea tree oil in your regular shampoo and leave in for just a bit longer. Save money and just take a pass on JASON.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming smell, works great.</li>
            <li> I have skin allergies to a lot of the chemicals companies put in typical shampoos so I was looking for a natural shampoo for dandruff relief. This is the second one that I tried (after the first was ineffective) and just finished off the bottle. It did a fantastic job getting rid of the dandruff, but the shampoo is so thick that I had trouble working it up to a lather to work through the ends of my shoulder-length hair. I ended up using it just on my scalp and a different shampoo to actually wash the length of my hair. Also the sulfur in it makes it smell a little strange and my boyfriend complained about the smell of my hair. I would buy it again if it wasn&#x27;t so thick because it did relieve the dandruff and itching.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I usually buy a bottle each fall, and after two washes, my dandruff is gone. I&#x27;ll use it throughout the winter to ensure it doesn&#x27;t come back. It&#x27;s never failed my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love that product, helped a lot with scalp itchiness !</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;ve been buying products for years and years on Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to leave a review on a product.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with flakes my entire life pretty well and have always been frustrated by them.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous over the counter products with little to no affect.  Tar based products, Head and Shoulders, etc. all have done nothing but cause more of a problem.  I decided that it was just going to be a fact of life that I was going to have flakes.  The only thing that I could get to do a decent job of managing the flakes was prescription ointments that typically contained a topical steroid.  Not a good thing for prolonged use.  There in lies the problem though.  As soon as I stopped using the ointment it was just a matter of time for the flakes to come back.  Enter Jason Dandruff Relief shampoo.  I was obviously not really convinced it was going to do anything but I gave it a try anyways.  Needless to say my scalp is completely clear now.  I can wear dark shirts without any worries at all.  The best test of all is my dark pillows which in the past after a nights sleep would be covered in flakes.  Now they are completely spotless!!  I expected a little help but not a complete clear up!  I use the product every three days or so and everything is great.  The tea tree oil does have a distinct smell but nothing compared to a tar based product.  Definitely a small price to pay for such amazing results.  For a little better scent I simply use a good light conditioner and that takes care of it.  I feel my scalp is very clean now and healthy which trust me is an amazing feeling.  I highly recommend the product for anyone who&#x27;s dealt with this embarrassing problem for as long as they can remember!</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a more natural way to take care of dandruff. Since I already color my hair and use heat on it for styling, I wanted a gentle shampoo for take care of my dry scalp and overall health of my hair.  First off, it smells to me exactly like Tums or Pepto Bismol...kinda weird, but I guess not the worst thing ever. It&#x27;s like a chalky menthol type smell and no, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair... you will smell like Tums.  I used this Jason Dandruff Shampoo a few times, but I found it not too effective. It may have helped a little, but for me the thing that helps the most is a Apple Cider Vinegar and water concoction. Cheap, simple, and so far works the best for me. I understand there are different types of dandruff so my review shouldn&#x27;t be a deciding factor. My own personal experience of dry scalp and white flaky dandruff is best solved by the H2O and ACV.</li>
            <li> I have had Psoriasis of the scalp since I was a young child and I have tried just about everything that I can think of with mixed results.  I found for me that the salicylic acid and sulfur works best for me.  I had used Sebulex for the last 15 years, but it is hard to find and more expensive.  So, since Jason had the same active ingredients and it was cheaper, I decided to give it a try.  To my surprise, it actually works better than Sebulex.  It also has a thicker and richer lather.  If I use it everyday in the morning, it is like I don&#x27;t have Psoriasis/Dandruff anymore.  I can skip a day without much effect too which is also a new nicety.  Some have commented on the smell, but that is a small inconveinience for someone that really has a dandruff problem that needs addressed.  BTW, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after you rinse.  But you could wash your hair a second time in a regular shampoo if that is a concern.  Just remember to leave The Jason shampoo on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t spend a lot on stuff like this, but I always try to have a bottle of this stuff around just to use 2-3 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts longer than you might expect. I really noticed a difference in how my hair looked and how my scalp felt. I highly  recommend this product, even if you aren&#x27;t having dandruff problems. You will quickly notice a difference when you treat your scalp well.</li>
            <li> After have proven almost everything for my stubborn seborrheic scurf finally I found the relief in Jason Dandruff Shampoo, in addition don&#x27;t have the usually bad smell of most dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Helps control my dry scalp without all of the chemicals. Also my hair feels healthy after using it. The scent is not heavy</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have been suffering from dandruff all my life. I tried many products and nothing seemed to consistently do the job. Etching was gone the first time. Flakes are greatly reduced after first use but I&#x27;m using it every day now and it seems like it is going away! Shocking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not bad at all! I don&#x27;t get why people are complaining about it! It actually smells more herbal and natural than all other strong chemical products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo helps to prevent skin dryness and irritation, but it has very strong and unusual smell, maybe these are oils...</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this shampoo I have NEVER, NEVER been able to go more than three days without washing my hair, now I can go 4-5.  I used the very expensive Selsun Blue for years, then Head &amp; Shoulders came out with a selenium sulfide shampoo so I switched to that, then Walmart came out with their version.  Alll had the same results.  By the end of day two, my scalp would be itching badly and become inflamed from the seborrhheic dermatitis.  Following the instructions by leaving it on for several minutes before rinsing is critical.  It lathers really well considering it is sulfate free.  I bought this mainly because as a practicing &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; I needed a sulfate free dandruff shampoo that would treat my seborrheic dermatitis.  HOWEVER..it stinks and it is medicinanny smell.  and the scent lingers all day.  I have others smell my hair to get their opinion, and they don&#x27;t thinks it&#x27;s that bad, but still, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for my son&#x27;s scalp.  We followed the directions listed by another reviewer, Joel S. Perry, from  November 26, 2011 and they were very helpful.  My son said that he felt it worked better if he let the shampoo sit on his scalp for 10 mins. before rinsing.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do too much to help my husbands itchiness.</li>
            <li> Difficult to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has not really been improving my dandruff problem. Then again, I&#x27;m not someone who washes their hair every day so not sure if that&#x27;s necessary for full effectiveness? The dandruff is gone for a day or two and then returns worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sulfur-like smell isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone makes it out to be, at least for me. It fades away after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL. Not good for people with a lot of hair. I feel like I&#x27;m using half the bottle just to spread it throughout my hair. I almost feel like I need to use another shampoo on top of it to truly get it clean.</li>
            <li> My teen age son was having a bad time with flaking.  Nothing over the counter seemed to do him any good.  Once he started using Jason his dandruff has improved ALOT.  No more snow on his shirt!</li>
            <li> I never used this, my mom didn&#x27;t either, eventually went to my dad who has the same scalp issues as me. it calmed down his scalp</li>
            <li> Though the first fragrant layer of this shampoo is nice and herbally my husband and I couldn&#x27;t get past the lingering sulfur smell that the shampoo leaves in your hair. That being said I don&#x27;t mind it too much though I usually use a conditioner after the fact just to add a more pleasant aroma. In general, I really like JASON products- it works well on the dandruff even after only a few washes- though mine isn&#x27;t too bad in the firs place. I do wish the fragrance was better though...</li>
            <li> I have been fighting the problem for many years - very sensitive skin, so any changes in water/hair care/stress level would impact my scalp immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Philip B Anti-Flake, but it is expensive. Saw this reviewed in one of the magazines I read and thought I should try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it has a very STRONG smell. I thought initially that it is a good thing - those smelly dandruff fighting agents. Well, it does not work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for maybe a day and then gets SO MUCH WORSE that stuff that used to help does not help any more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is so much like rotten eggs/sulfur that it gave me a headache! I could hardly go to sleep after drying my hair. I gave it away. I will stick with Rx Ketokonazole.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the positive reviews and searching high and low for a product that was both natural/SLS-free and could help my dandruff. It did absolutely nothing to help my scalp and smelled really nasty. My head smelled like a match and the smell didn&#x27;t go away when my hair dried. I would have put up with it had the shampoo made a difference on my scalp but it did nothing! I&#x27;m sending this back.</li>
            <li> Gross gross gross! Why would anyone use this is beyond me, it smells like sulfur and has been making me feel sick all day.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t smell like rubber!  I bought it for my husband and he used it couple of times and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and it is a winner!  I have been looking for something natural to help with his itchy scalp and dandruff and he likes it!</li>
            <li> I like the product but I did not like the buying process... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:( :( :( :( :( :( :(</li>
            <li> I am trying to eliminate dandruff/dry scalp and unfortunately, I can&#x27;t review for that purpose at this time but I can tell you this shampoo has one of the worst odors I&#x27;ve smelt in quite a white. It smells like a dirty, old motel room that needs a severe renovation. Maybe this is because they have to hide the scent of the active ingredients. I have to admit, although I smell repulsive, my hair looks great. This stuff also doesn&#x27;t foam up like standard shampoo but that seems to be common with natural brands it it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. I have a ton of hair so more foam makes me feel like I&#x27;ve done a better job washing each strand. With this type of product I have to use a ton to feel like i&#x27;ve covered it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** It has been a few weeks and I feel confident that my scalp has improved! I am so thankful to have found a product that finally offers me comfort. I had terrible itching if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair daily and scalp build up (gross I know)... With this product, my scalp no longer itches or has build-up. I definitely recommend giving this a try. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive products and dermatologist recommended products without result. I didn&#x27;t expect much from this and the odor was a huge turn-off. As I said, it smells like someone&#x27;s moldy, old basement but if you stick with it, you may see results too. I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this considering the smell but it&#x27;s true, my scalp is better. I will report back if I am dealing with build up again.</li>
            <li> Product actually works well for dandruff.  But I would recommend a good conditioner as this shampoo severely dries out the hair.</li>
            <li> Use this product 2-3 X per week and have been dandruff free for years.&lt;br /&gt;Have not looked at all the ingredients too closely but know that most of them are Natural.</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem good, the scent is not bad, the price is alright, but the performence is not what I thought it was going to be. I used it twice a week for over a month (sometimes 3 times) and it did not really do what i expected. At times I felt like it was helping my dry and itchy scalp, but most of the time I did not see any long term solution besides the initial soothing comfort. On the side note, it does leave your hair feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo,scalp treatment, and oil for my dry scalp and until I used this shampoo everything else cannot compare. I used it for 5 days which got rid of the crusty, scaly embarrassing scalp and flakes. It did turn a sterling silver ring of mine a kind of dark color probably because of the ingredients but it came off with baking soda. I now use it once or twice a week and it keeps my scalp flake and crust free. Will continue to buy even though it&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I only tried it once, it did diminish the itching but it does have a strong unpleasant smell. I am sure that&#x27;s the ingredient that makes it effective.</li>
            <li> First of all, it has a very comfortable fragrance taste; secondly, remove dandruff effect it is a better I used in shampoo. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> My fiance experiences dandruff from time to time. Head and Shoulders worked okay for a while, but we wanted something a bit better. This wash has a strong smell, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t stay on his head all day. The dandruff is under far better control.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast. It only helped a little bit with my scalp flaking. I would have to shower and wash my hair every day for it to work. But if I do that, it will dry my scalp more and make the flaking worse. I will stick to T-Gel until I can get prescription strength shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li> It works very well for a few days before you have to use it again.  I did it 2 days in a row then buzzed my hair, flaking was minimized.  The trade off is that your head (and aura around you) smells like sulfur for at least 48 hours.  I tried to wash with other shampoos to get rid of the smell but it didnt work.  If Jason could fix the smell I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but to not have dandruff is the objective here.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff and itchy scalp for about 3 years now.  I have used everything.  I&#x27;ve tried jojoba and tea tree oil shampoos and apple cider vinegar and honey remedies.  The apple cider vinegar worked well for me, but was such a pain to apply and really stunk up my hair.  I had to find an easier route so I tried this shampoo.  This one worked for me.  My dandruff has definitely decreased, not 100% gone, but the real benefit was with the itching.  I would buy this just for that alone.    I like the fact that you can use this a couple times a week, which I use it about once every two days and that does the trick.  People complain about the smell, but when you go from apple cider vinegar to this, you won&#x27;t complain.  Not too mention I have tried other natural shampoos that smell just as bad.  I just spray some hairspray on when it&#x27;s dry and that takes away a good amount of it.   Remember that everyone is different.  What works for me, might not work for you, but I would recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis as long as I can remember. I have been using this treatment shampoo for years... but it is difficult to find at local retailers. I am allergic to sulfates and this shampoo contains none. I like the scent but husband describes it as \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; so you may not like that. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair too long after I shower.  My scalp condition has improved greatly over the last year but I am faithful about my fish oil and a wheat-free diet. I believe that has made a huge difference. I still use this product once a week for maintenance. It is very hydrating and tingles when I let it sit on my scalp (around 5 minutes). I actually look forward to using it! It will remain in my regimen for years to come, I have no doubt. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of stopping the iching and flaking, gets ride of oil and scalp odor as well. Shampoo has a chemical smell that does linger for a few days.Don&#x27;t use this shampoo twice in a row, make sure you use another regular shampoo to wash this one out before you apply it again. The worst thing I did was wash my hair with this, then wash it again the next day. My hair became a tangled and weighed down greasy mess that I had to wash my hair that same night with my regular shampoo to get it clean. I also pair this with an anti-residue shampoo once a week to really clean and remove all the gunk from my hair, including the sulfur in the Jason Dandruff shampoo. Overall really good dandruff shampoo that cleans well and stops flakes/scalp odor, it&#x27;s the chemical smell that keep it from being perfect.</li>
            <li> Provided much better relief than Head and Shoulders.  I was skeptical, but I am glad I tried it.  The bottle lasts quite a while, too!</li>
            <li> Great product. It took me about 3 washes to get rid of everything, but once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s gone as long as you use the shampoo a couple of times a week. I just purchased my second bottle. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this most days for over a week now leaving on for 5-6 minutes each time, in hopes of relieving itching and scabby bumps. While I have less flaking overall it does not seem to have done much for my scalp. Seems like the older positive reviews are for an older formulation of this, as tea tree oil is no longer an ingredient and the sulfur smell is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the contents but it works amazingly well. I compared it to another product Pura d&#x27;or I purchased for a lot more money and this one works, the other one did not.&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> During the dry season my scalp tends to become very itchy resulting in a mild case of dandruff. I purchased this because it had more natural products than other dandruff shampoos. While in the process of shampooing my hair, I did enjoy the sensation and smell. It does clean my hair well and no conditioner is needed. However, this product did weigh my hair down and the smell lingered on throughout the whole day and for these reasons, I will not repurchase. I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell and found myself overly self-conscious and couldn&#x27;t wait to shampoo my hair with another product to get rid of the scent. To conclude, it helped with the dandruff but the smell was too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Neutragena t-gel suddenly stopped working for me after using it 3 times/week for 15 years. I also tried the maximum strength t-gel with no success. I recently read that coal-tar is a carcinogen and decided to switch to a more natural option since the t-gel wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  This shampoo has a strong odor, comparable to coal-tar shampoos, but I don&#x27;t mind because it gets rid of the flakes. I paired it with another Jason shampoo with a mint scent and that improved the residual odor.  This is the new formula with no tea tree oil and it works great.</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his scalp and it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried. A little bit hard to find in the stores so I am glad that amazon sells it at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works really well!  I love it!  It works better than any other shampoos I&#x27;ve used for dandruff!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this to use for his hair.  It has helped him get rid of his flakes and dry scalp.  I thought I&#x27;d try it since he liked it, but it has a very strong smell and because I only wash my hair twice/week, the smell lingered for days!  So, great shampoo for men (or those with short hair), but not the best for us ladies with long hair and sensitive noses!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo before and it worked great. I bought a new bottle last week and when I opened the package, there wasn&#x27;t a label on the front of the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure what to think. Should I be concerned? Other than that, this product last time I used it, improved/ diminished my itchy dry winter scalp. I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t used this new bottle without the label yet....</li>
            <li> My husband has tried a number of shampoos.  This was the best one by far!  He still rotates in the old shampoos but so far it&#x27;s held up for 3 months now.  great deal!</li>
            <li> Only product I have found to help get rid of itchy bumps on my head.  Also leaves haie soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this exact product. I got the regular shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> I have gone very natural with my hair and have only washed with water for the last ten months, but dandruff was getting the best of me. I tried some home remedies, but nothing seemed to have a lasting effect, so I went looking for a natural shampoo solution. I thought I had found what I needed with Jason&#x27;s &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;, since the reviews were so good, but no luck. It is NOT natural. The active ingredient is salicylic acid, which I learned a lot about during pregnancy. It is not safe for pregnant women to use, and because of that, I don&#x27;t really want to use it even when not pregnant. I didn&#x27;t realize this was the active ingredient until I had used it once. Tried it a second time, too, but I probably won&#x27;t use it again. It only kind of worked for me. The smell is strong, but not horrible in my opinion. Not sure why they chose to use salicylic acid as it has a very drying effect. Doesn&#x27;t make sense that it would help with a dry scalp? Wish I could return it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t that expensive...</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dermatitis in the winter my whole life, but this year was the first time that it affected my scalp in a way that made it hard to deal with and quite embarrassing. I tried many shampoos from popular drugstore brands to expensive organic ones, each using different active ingredients to solve the problem (tea tree, aloe, etc) and this one with sulfur as the main ingredient had the best results. I noticed a difference after the first wash, and by the second or third my scalp dryness was no longer an issue. Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the prettiest for shampoo, but it&#x27;s way easier for me to deal with than huge chunks of flakes all over my clothes. I spray my hair with perfume and that does the trick. And by the second or third day I can&#x27;t smell it anymore until I wash my hair again.  Very happy with this purchase and glad my shampoo hunt is over!</li>
            <li> Great product ... It actually help you&lt;br /&gt;B.U.T smells bad .. Really really bad&lt;br /&gt;Even your pillow gets this smell after you you it ...</li>
            <li> After so many years of having dandruff, this shampoo was a miracle! Three washes and it was already evident that it was doing its job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Dandruff problem remain.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as terrible as other said.&lt;br /&gt;I used for more than 2 weeks now. No improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half flakes and itching have very much improved. I have tried many other shampoos and conditioner but most do not work that well I hope to keep seeing results and I like the natural product no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Because of all the good reviews on this product I decided to try it for my moderate to severe dandruff. Unfortunately it did not work at all for me. It actually made my dandruff worse! The smell is terrible to and will get you noticed in a negative way. This is just my experience with the product however. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a a black woman with coarse natural hair. A lot of people suggest that women with natural hair should cowash since shampoos strip your hair of moisture and natural oils. However, I noticed my hair had too much buildup and started itching a lot during the past year (I&#x27;ve been natural for three). The hair can be as moisturized as you like, but it won&#x27;t grow as much as you like if you have a consistently dirty scalp.I tried the trader joes tea tree line, as well as natural cleansers, apple cider vinegar, you name it. This product worked really well for me. I still wash once a week, although the instructions suggest 2-3 times I think. It is VERY drying! I make sure to deep condition after every wash because of it. It does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I had to review because its been about 2 weeks since i stopped using this product and my scalp is itchy and flaky again. It works! and it slightly flattens hair so if you have slightly oily hair it may weigh it down a little which is why i gave 4/5. Another reason I gave 4/5 is because you can&#x27;t buy the dandruff version in a larger size.</li>
            <li> does help with dandruff</li>
            <li> It will leave you smelling like eggs, because of the sulfur content.</li>
            <li> I have pretty marked seborheric dermatitis, and I have never-chemically-processed African hair.  This makes it hard to treat-most dandruff treatments require daily use (haha if you have my type of hair)and aree very harsh and drying.  I have prob tried everything from home made remedies (which are very useful), to Flax oil, to ignoring it, to this.  Infact I have not been able to find this for a while and stumbled on it by accident.  This shampoo is mild relative to most, and extremely effective. IT suds well and doesn&#x27;t strip dry african hair.  I have only ever found 1 other shampoo that allowed me to &#x27;see my scalp.\\&quot;  This is awesome and is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great for my husband and I!  I love that it is natural and non toxic, and also it gives great results.  I have mild dandruff (for the last 20 odd years!) and this shampoo gave me results in 3 applications that Head &amp; Shoulders did not ever provide.  I now use it every 3rd shampoo, for maintenance.  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> Needed an alternative to dandruff shampoos that have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is used in most of the well known brands to create foam. I realized that when a drop of SGS touches my forehead I get a painful rash and breakout that lasts a week. Have read really bad things about SGS on the internet. Jason has worked well and leaves hair looking good. The only downside is the initial smell from the sulfur which is brief while applying it. I am happy with the results and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick, and I don&#x27;t feel as guilty because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harsh chemicals a lot of dandruff shampoos do. The only thing, which I know is probably unavoidable, is that it does leave a slight strange odor from the sulfur content. I mix the shampoo with another, more pleasant smelling natural shampoo, to lessen this effect. It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Especially during winters get bouts of dandruff and dry scalp. I had tried selsun way back but it made my hair turn brown. Was very worried about the effects of that strong shampoo on my hair and was looking for something more natural but effective. I loved this shampoo. Really works great and doesn&#x27;t harm my hair. With one use i could see the difference and it solved the dry scalp issue. I am very happy with the product and recommended this to all my friends and everyone is happy with this product. I have found the shampoo one that works and will never try another one for dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> ..the shampoo has no neem or tea tree oil at all...it has evidently changed since they first offered it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...beware if you are looking for those specific ingredients in a shampoo..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..*UPDATE* ...after emailing both the seller and Amazon, I still don&#x27;t know if they still make the original formula, nor if anything will be done about the misleading advertising...seller blamed Amazon for shipping it...Amazon did give me a refund...so I will try a different brand and a different seller..</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results! This is a really great product! Will continue to purchase as long as its available!</li>
            <li> The BEST for scalps prone to irritation. Heals eczema and seborrhea dermatitis. The smell is not the best though.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff that actually worked. However, it leaves a strange unpleasant scent on my hair that follows me throughout the day and gets on everything. It&#x27;ll get the scent on whatever your hair touches, be it your hands or your pillow. It must be some strong stuff because even if I use another shampoo afterwards the smell remains in my hair. It&#x27;s very unpleasant and I had to stop using it. It&#x27;s not a generic chemical smell either, like selsun blue or head and shoulders. It&#x27;s very distinct, and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; in the worst sense of the word.</li>
            <li> I started using this because I was suggested by it on a few forums from research. The reason I started using this Shampoo specifically is because my hair would have a bad smell to it a few hours after taking a shower. After researching more about my problem, I believe I am in the &amp;#34;smelly hair syndrome&amp;#34; category. Basically there is no permanent &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for this. But I have been using this as suggested by others, and it as taken it away ever since I have been using it. I have ran out of this stuff occasionally, and after about 1-2 weeks, the smell came back. I got more again, and sure enough, it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crap works if you have smelly hair syndrome.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it stinks to high heaven. I&#x27;m used to the weird smells of medicated shampoos but this one is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. It does seem to get better as you continue to use it so don&#x27;t give up after just one use. I had a couple of friends give me a smell test to see if it was noticeable and they said it wasn&#x27;t so that made me feel better. It has helped my itchy scalp that I get every winter. I also don&#x27;t have a problem with the lack of lather (and I have long hair), I&#x27;ve used natural shampoos before so I was expecting that. I don&#x27;t find that it makes my hair frizzy, dry, etc as some other reviewers said. It may not work for everyone, which I&#x27;d say is generally the case with just about any product, but I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Looking for a less toxic product, but this is not friendly to my fine blond hair. Left it feeling sticky and was difficult to style later.</li>
            <li> Dandruff never went away.  Even after using it everyday for a month, same problem persists.  Look somewhere else.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in that it&#x27;s natural and works AMAZINGLY to get rid of dandruff/psoriasis! I have tried so many things and this has done wonders! I have had psoriasis on my scalp for almost 10 years and this is the first thing that I have used that has gotten rid of the itch and the big scabby flakes! The smell isn&#x27;t horrible but well worth it for what it does. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I just wrote a review on Zincplex. Jason&#x27;s is a miracle product as it has helped me greatly! The smell isn&#x27;t terrific but who care! My itching has lessened and it is working to repair my damaged scalp. Cudos to Jason and their dedication to put out high quality products at a fair price. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I love it and I use it several times a week....but goodness does it stink! Still, it&#x27;s worth it and once my hair is dry the smell goes away. Just be ready for a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo for my husband. I have done a lot of research on the effects of the nasty chemicals that are in regular hair care products. Jason was the first dandruff shampoo we tried and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. With the Head and Shoulders brand, my husband would get flakes back the very next day if he skipped even 1 day&#x27;s shower. With Jason, the flakes don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked very well. I had tried several anti-dandruff shampoos previously, and none of them really worked; this got rid of all my dandruff after only a couple of uses. I have been using it for the past four months, and intend to buy it again. The only downside is that it has a slightly unusual smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. Thick foam.</li>
            <li> Is the second time I bought this product for my husband. He has dry scalp and this product has helped him a lot.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other stuff and it only lessoned the dandruff but with this stuff the dandruff is completely gone within a month.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have dandruff, but this was recommended tp me for dry scalp due to eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff certainly does the trick. Doesn&#x27;t seem to smell terrible during use. Holy jibblies does this ever smell once you&#x27;ve rinsed it out and dried off. Do NOT use this if you need to be in close proximity to others any time in the next 24 hours.</li>
            <li> works to keep my scalp clear; I started by using 2-3 times a week for first three weeks now I&#x27;m down to once a week if I choose to twist hair or style is however.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My children get scabs and flakes on their scalp. One child is scab/flake free already. We have tried several natural dandruff shampoos. The Jason&#x27;s dandruff shampoo is giving us the best results.</li>
            <li> Effective formula, no flakes. Leaves my hair feeling soft and slightly aromatic. Girls cant keep their hands out of it.</li>
            <li> i just received this bottle of shampoo and used it for the first time. as far as effectiveness is concerned, this remains to be seen. right now, my scalp feels soothed and clean. i have very long thick hair which sometimes waves at the ends but is mostly just straight, thick and heavy. i have had scalp issues my entire life regardless of the length of my hair, i always have some sort of flaking at best, at worst patches of rashes and scabbing. i will update this post after a few more uses regarding my experience with flaking, rashes, scabbing etc. i noticed in some of the prior postings that the smell of this shampoo was a concern, that it had a sulphuric odor. i did not smell sulphur at all. the bottle i received has sort of a &amp;#34;cleaning product&amp;#34; smell, my first association was that of &amp;#34;a blue gel used to clean the toilet.&amp;#34; in my opinion, yes, it smells sort of like toilet cleaner. it smells kind of minty and clean, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that off-putting sulfur smell that i was bracing myself for. after using my normal conditioner, i dont smell the shampoo at all. i will update my post after a few more uses as far as effectiveness is concerned. i enjoyed using it, it lathered well for me and the smell was decent and clean smelling compared to a lot of the other products out there. fingers crossed that this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like shampoos that don&#x27;t have SLS in them because they are difficult to lather and don&#x27;t get your hair clean, but this stuff is really amazing.  At first it feels like it is not lathering well, but if you keep at it, and then rinse and repeat, the second application lathers up really nicely.  I left it on for a few minutes and it was tingly and my hair came out clean and soft.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all.  I bought this because I have Rosacea and it has recently been theorized that Rosacea and some scalp problems are caused by Demodex mites, which are killed by sulfur, the active ingredient in this shampoo, so I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I bought this Product and have used it for two days , and I could see the difference..&lt;br /&gt;Its a must buy for people suffering from Dandruff..</li>
            <li> But the smell from using it keeps it out of my shower. C&#x27;mon guys 2013. Fix the horrible smell. You can do it</li>
            <li> BUY THIS TO GET RID OF DANDRUFF!!! It works, my son tried lots of antidandruff shampoos.  Then I read the reviews about this shampoo on amazon.com. I bought it and was skeptic that it would work. The first day of using Jason the dandruff  was considerably less, second day even more dandruff gone and within a week all dandruff gone. Use it for at least a month straight to see results!</li>
            <li> Husband will never use another shampoo!</li>
            <li> This product did help my dandruff but BEWARE - IT WILL TARNISH AND MAY EVEN OXIDIZE AND RUIN STERLING SILVER AND GOLD PLATED JEWELRY. It is from the sulfur, which will oxidize - and can even corrode and ruin - sterling silver and gold-plated silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very bummed because my scalp was better (once I got over the smell) but it ruined a beautiful goldplated necklace my husband gave me for Mother&#x27;s Day one year. This makes it one of the most expensive bottles of shampoo I ever purchased, when I consider how much it will cost to replace the necklace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WERE JEWELRY!</li>
            <li> My dandruff gets crazy now and again and I have used Selsen Blue for a long time... This stuff works great.  My scalp has less buildup on it and  it controls my dandruff well.  Will def purchase this again! Love the smell too (I&#x27;m a tea tree oil fan).</li>
            <li> Hair Type Information: Brown (dyed Red), Wavy, Fine Hair Strands, Thick Amount of Hair, Oily Bangs/Roots, Moderate Dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue most of life, both had always left a burnt hair smell after my hair dried and I had to wash with the shampoo every day to avoid flakes falling on all my clothes and, of course, it left my hair very dry. When I switched to Jason, the first thing I noticed was the burnt smell was gone and I could go up to three days without having to use the shampoo before my scalp got a little bit itchy which has been incredibly liberating. It&#x27;s also more gentle on my dyed hair than Selsun Blue. Additionally, in comparison to the other products I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s the closest to a natural/organic-ish shampoo that I&#x27;ve gotten which makes me feel better about what&#x27;s coming in contact with my skin and hair. It has less scary chemicals and fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It can dry your hair out the way all dandruff shampoos can so just make sure you have a good conditioner to apply to your hair after shampooing. If your hair is similar to mine, you may also want to use a little cream conditioner for dry or damp hair after you get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addressing the Smell:&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews about the smell and it&#x27;s one of those smells in which you&#x27;ll ever like it or hate it depending on what you&#x27;re used to. The smell is very herbal (Rosemary, Olive, Jojoba) so when I opened the bottle it reminded me of a homemade medicinal remedy. For me personally, this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I love Rosemary and Olive and I find the homemade herbal smell quality to be soothing.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the type that loves the fruit and flower artificial scents found in most shampoos, then you probably won&#x27;t like the smell. If you&#x27;re trying to hop on the anti-artificial scent band wagon or if you enjoy earthy smells, then you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note - On Using the Product:&lt;br /&gt;Please notethat this product does NOT lather so be sure to grab a generous amount of shampoo and really massage it into your scalp for the best results. If you don&#x27;t, you may start flaking sooner.&lt;br /&gt;When you condition afterwards, I suggest leaving the conditioner in for a few minutes to counterbalance the drying side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, all natural, but has a very strong smell which I&#x27;m not sure if everyone is ok with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have seborrheic dermatitis (basically psoriasis on the scalp and behind ears), and I am also starting to grow my hair out long which means I really need to take care of my hair.  I wanted something without sulfates because my hair has always been frizzy when grown long in the past, but it was hard to find something like that &amp; good for my scalp at the same time.  I used this one time so far, ONE.  Together with Jason&#x27;s natural biotin conditioner, I&#x27;m sold.  This smells so awesome, like a mix of tar &amp; tea tree.  I used it the same as I used any other shampoo, massaged it into the scalp for a minute or two and left it sit for 1-2 minutes.  It took nothing to rinse it out with cool water, as well.  It did a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp without drying the skin out.</li>
            <li> This fall, I started to get flakes on my head. I was using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree castile soap to wash my hair and scalp at the time. When the flakes showed up, I started using Head and Shoulders. That did not ameliorate the problem; in fact I think it got worse. Then I tried working a solution of coconut oil melted in warm water into my scalp, and rubbing apple cider vinegar into my scalp, but those attempts didn&#x27;t solve my problem, either.&lt;br /&gt;After four washes with the Jason Dandruff Relief Shampoo my flakes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;As an added benefit, the recurring pink spots with scaly skin on top that I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for years have mostly cleared up, and I think my hair looks healthier than at any time I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Jason Dandruff Relief Shampoo is great product and very effective! cure my dandruff and I&#x27;m flakes free, Totally recommending this product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair really clean BUT it doesn&#x27;t do too much for my dandruff. It keeps the dandruff away for a couple days but then it comes back. This shampoo would be good for those who wash their hair every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li> This worked okay for me; but the value is poor compared to Sage shampoo which did the same thing for me; but required much less product to produce as much lather.</li>
            <li> It might work, but it smells bad to me so I rarely use it.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a shampoo for my scalp that works, but doesn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> so a lot of the other reviews were right about the bottle advertised is not the bottle you will receive. well it is but its the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; one. which has different ingredients and makes the shampoo less effective. the smell is really medicated and kind of reminds me of a retirement home smell. which is weird because my boyfriend actually likes the smell. Now BEWARE , if you style your hair with a flat iron , hair dryer, or curler the smell transforms into the most foul smell ever. the first time i discovered this i couldn&#x27;t breath because it was so gross. Its like burnt medicated rotten eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways my dandruff is really bad so i had no choice but to fight through the smell to see what the results were. I used it three times a week for two weeks and well I&#x27;m not very impressed. I still have dandruff not a lot of it but its there i can see it. and especially when i just get out of the shower its the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i will buy another bottle after this one runs out, unless they bring the old formula back.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved the product, for I felt it was helping with my dandruff problem which only something like T-gel did temporarily, Head and Shoulders never seemed to really help. But as time went on I noticed that this product really had a bad smell associated with it. I have done a few other things to help my dandruff such as washing my hair only a few times a week as well as using cool water to try to help with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially when you use the shampoo its fragrance kind of covers the nasty sulfury smell, but those with a strong sense of smell can still smell it. As the day goes on the fragrance fades leaving just the sulfur smell in your hair. I have since completely stopped the use of this product looking at other companies for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came up when I searched sulfate free shampoo, but that is obviously not the case. When I purchased this product it contained no sulfates but another derivative, which I felt would be okay at the time. I have never used a shampoo which makes my hair smell worse than before I washed it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were too good to be true. But since I moved to IL from CA 2.5 years ago I have been suffering from dandruff and I have not been able to find a cure. I have used all famous shampoos, though they gave relief when I used them, there was nothing permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 2 days ago and after using it just once, the dandruff is gone. No itchy scalp, no dandruff, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell issue - Well there is little smell and only little. Nothing like you will be walking like a chemical plant. Frankly compared to the relief it gives, the smell is nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a magical product and I wonder why I did not find this thing two years ago.</li>
            <li> Most of my life my hair has been healthy, thick and dark-brownish. However, the last couple of years I had serious issues with flakes, itchiness and irritation. Man, my scalp was really messed up! I tried several other products, a lot of them and none of them worked or just worked temporarily and then my scalp was again irritated and producing lots of flakes. Going to the barber shop was always embarrassing because I would always have white dots all around my head or my shoulders during the session. And as embarrassing as it sounds, this doesn&#x27;t happen because you don&#x27;t take good care of your hair. A combination of chemicals in the water, the shampoos you use or even drastic climatic changes affect your scalp...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the product: I was getting very desperate until I came to Amazon and read people&#x27;s opinions on this shampoo that I decided to buy it. It arrived very quickly thanks to Amazon prime and the price was very reasonable. Once it arrived I just followed the directions and I immediately felt relief. The itchiness, the dryness and even most of the flakiness were gone almost immediately. By the third day I had next to nothing and now it&#x27;s GONE. I actually went for a haircut last Saturday and for the first time in a couple of years I saw no white spots/flakes coming out of my hair. My hair looks strong, healthy and very thick, just the way it was before I had issues with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: it is worth your time and money to try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Pricey but the best Dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (aging) mother whose scalp was flaking so much that she would not wash her hair, believing that her scalp was dry from washing. My daughter had chronic dandruff and this product worked for her so I sent a bottle to mom. She and dad love it, and mom is washing her hair again ( a minor miracle). Both she and dad love the way their hair feels and looks, it adds body and shine. The dandruff is gone!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great in controlling dry scalp and flakes. I also like the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> the purpose of this product is great its just the smell of the shampoo which is tripping me up.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this shampoo - it&#x27;s more creamy like a conditioner. The smell is interesting - not too medicated and a little herby. It cools my scalp and it has reduced (though not eliminated) my flakes. That being said, I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once. It&#x27;s been a week and my hair reeks of sulfur still.  Even after using several things to neutralize the odor (tomato juice, baking soda, vinegar, and several shampoo washes).  I cannot get over how bad the smell still is after several hair washes.  The actual shampoo does not smell that bad.  Like a mild soapy smell.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have extremely long hair that the smell still lingers.  Please do not buy this product unless you want to smell like sulfur.  I do not understand how this product has gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Took 3 days but it did significantly reduce my dandruff post pregnancy. Plus I liked the tingling feeling when I&#x27;d leave it on for 3 minutes or so. My dandruff went away eventually and I credit the shampoo and that my hormones eventually balanced after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Love it. I purchased this shampoo, because I have a family that brought it in sad it should work on ringworm. I have a son that had ring worms for months that he get from a barber shop.  So I took him to the doctor for them and she give me some medicine for them.  So I give him the medicine and it look like they was working.  A week later I notices they was coming back. So I took him back so said up the doses of the medicine and told me that this medicine can affect his kidney. So I was tell my sister about it and she told me to try this. And I did in it work wonderful after I wash his head in it for about two week and I have not seen no more ringworm..</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the delivery was disappointing.  The shampoo was sealed in a bag, but the cap was open, so when I opened the bag, there was shampoo all over!  I had to clean it up, and I lost a substantial amount of product - that&#x27;s upsetting when you spend $12 on a small bottle of shampoo. The product smells a little funky.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY dandruff shampoos over the years.  Dozens.  Dozens of dozens.  Even many expensive, obscure ones and--yes--even prescription grade.  Nothing has ever worked...until this miracle in a bottle.  I get thick, flaky dandruff which has been resistant to every remedy until now.  Some other shampoos have helped a LITTLE, but most do nothing and many make it worse (with harsh irritating ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY dandruff shampoo I have ever tried that has COMPLETELY CURED my dandruff.  It&#x27;s not less flaking, it&#x27;s not just a little better...the dandruff and flaking is GONE.  I could hardly believe it when, after a week, my scalp was flake-free for the first time in my LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried a hundred other shampoos with no luck...TRY THIS ONE before you give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People here who complain about the smell...it&#x27;s minty and eucalyptus (tee tree smell).  I guess that bothers some people; I find it pleasant and refreshing.  And, frankly, par for the course with any serious dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side benefit (and probably on of the reasons for this product&#x27;s effectiveness), the shampoo is moisturizing.  It leaves the hair healthy, and minimizes frizz.  The only thing is that you have to shampoo pretty regularly, because it will get greasy after a day or two.  That&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t deplete your scalp&#x27;s moisture when you wash you hair; so you&#x27;re not on an oily-dry roller coaster.  It levels you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this stuff, and am still in a state of disbelief over the fact that my scalp is healthy and completely flake-free.  I never would have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Jason.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this. At first, it seemed like it made it better. Then later that day, the itching got much worse and the flakes got worse. I used it again and this time left it on my scalp longer. I think I may have even gotten an allergic reaction because I developed bumps and the dry itchy scalp has now spread to the other side. I&#x27;m not using it again. I&#x27;m back on Amazon trying to find a different product.</li>
            <li> Great quality. It helps reducing my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as an alternative to my usual dandruff shampoo. It works ok, but it&#x27;s not great. Also, it has a very distinct smell that isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, and I&#x27;m usually a fan of earthy scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who seems to have a perpetually flaky scalp.  I didn&#x27;t realize it had sulfur in it, or salicylic acid... It has a very strong sulfurous odor!  Not sure how it works, we had to get something that doesn&#x27;t smell so... strong in an unpleasant way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other shampoos during the dry winter months and this is the only one that works well for my scalp.  The smell isn&#x27;t too medicinal (more herbal) and when compared to the Neutrogena tar-like product, its light years better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Natural ingredients and the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found to keep my head from itching.</li>
            <li> This actually made my itch worse and smelled terrible. It smells like toilet bowl cleaner and you can smell it for days.</li>
            <li> My son and I have bad dandruff and we usually use head and shoulders.  I use neutrogena for him also.  This shampoo smells a lot like that, but it did not work for us.  I am 31 yrs old and he is 9 yrs old.  Our dandruff was still there just not as much before shampooing.  My hair was still itching immediately after use.  Head and shoulders work much better than this shampoo anyday.  I thought this shampoo was the one that will work wonders judging by the reviews.  NOT!!!! waste of time and money....</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered from dandruff for a very long time. She used this for the first time and i noticed a big difference with just one use. I am hoping this is what i&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry scalp issues on and off my entire life.. im 29 yrs old.. just recently it wouldnt go away.. i went to my dermatologist and the rx he usually prescribes didnt work :( So i went online, did some research about dry scalp. I discovered that i may be allergic to the harsh ingredients in regular shampoo! The only way to find out if i am allergic was to use one of the organic shampoos that i read about which were Jason and Aubrey Organic. I went to my local organic store and purchased both! I tried jason first.. and let me tell you..it instantly started working.. i felt the tingly sensation in my scalp and just an overall soothing sensation. the huge downside is the sulfur.. it made my entire bathroom / bedroom stink! i would have given it 5 stars.. but the smell is nasty.. so what i recommend is using this shampoo the days you arent going out anywhere fancy! lol.. i use aubrey primrose every other day and that is amazing as well! both shampoos worked well. I am proud to say that after 29 yrs my scalp is over 80 % better after only a few uses.. i cant wait to see what it looks like in a few more washed! Woohoo for organic shampoo! Bye bye harsh chemicals! I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I thought nothing could be worse then persistent dandruff but the sulfer in this leaves hair smelling like rotten eggs all day long! It&#x27;s pungent odor and the way it leaves hair looking super greasy is intolerable. I bought to have something natural to use for myself and my girls but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell and greasyness. I regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li> I was told I should get Jason Tea Tree Oil Shampoo to control my horrible, newly acquired dandruff. I mistakenly purchased Jason Dandruff Relief. It didn&#x27;t work any better then T-Gel, however I picked up some Tea Tree oil shampoo this past weekend and it started working from the first. Try Jason Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> Great Dandruff Shampoo</li>
            <li> no problems //  very fast service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type to write reviews, but with this product I couldn&#x27;t stop myself. I had been suffering from bad dandruff for years, I tried everything from products from the USA, and herbal stuff from my country. Nothing worked, if anything it got worse. I had people look at my head like I was a freak, even talked crap. I had a low self esteem. This product was seriously a answer to my prayers, and I saw major improvements after using it ONCE. The smell isn&#x27;t so bad as some people made it seem to be. I guess I was willing to go through anything to get rid of the dandruffs. GREAT product, can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> At first when I opened the bottle, I didn&#x27;t think the shampoo smelled that bad. I washed my hair that night and it wasn&#x27;t until after I got out of the shower that I noticed the chemical-y smell. However, by the morning, the smell had subsided. Tonight was the 2nd night I used the shampoo and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad. The greatest thing is that this shampoo has made a difference with my stinky scalp. Even though I wash my hair everyday, I still had a smelly scalp, my hair smelled fine, but my scalp stunk. I tried all kinds of different shampoos; T-Gel, H&amp;S, Kiss My Face and nothing helped. It seems that the combination of salicylic acid and sulphur works!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well for dry hair. I don&#x27;t normally like using shampoo because it breaks off my hair but this does not. It helps some with dandruff but it dosen&#x27;t cure it completely. The smell is not great. It smells medicated but I still love it for the fact that it leaves my hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li> not very impressed with this product.  it does have an odd pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Over the last 6 years I have tried everything from head and shoulders to selsun to neutrogena TGel. This is the only product that has worked to a point that once it gets rid of the dandruff you can resume your regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> My Seborrea is gone! in just one week after applying it 3 times a week.  Now i used it 1-2 a week . AWESOME</li>
            <li> I had a sever case of seborhea dermatitis for over 2 yrs. I tried every dandruff shampoo there is including prescription ones to no avail. I started using Jasons every day and within about 3 months I started seeing an improvement. A few months later it was all gone. I used to check my scalp throughly every day and used steriods on it. I haven&#x27;t touched the  steroids in many months. I rarely check my scalp anymore, just once in awhile to make sure all is good. I leave the shampoo in my hair for a half hour. You can feel it tingling and then it stops at about a half an hour. Now I am using the shampoo every other day. So far so good. I don&#x27;t know if it is the Jasons shampoo that has made this about turn around but am afraid to stop using it as my scalp was a nightmare before. I don&#x27;t know what else to attribute it to. 2 Dermatoligists told me I would have it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I bought this product specifically to have a dandruff shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t strip my color. I love the way the shampoo makes my hair feel and behave, and it has not removed any of my color, but the smell is really hard to get past and it last for days. I&#x27;m only using it once a week and it controls my dandruff just fine, i just wish that it smelled better.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this shampoo since my idea of shampoo is being at eye level in the shampoo isle at the grocery store.  I had pretty bad dandruff, and Head &amp; Shoulders and some others has never really worked for me, but this stuff cleared it right up and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> a bit thick in consistency, but overall ok.  helps with the dandruff issue fairly well.</li>
            <li> Brother had pretty bad dandruff, but i didn&#x27;t want him to use any harsh chemicals. We decided he should test out- JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo, Rosemary, Neem &amp; Tea Tree, 12 Ounces- and we saw an immediate decrease in flakes. He uses it every other day, as it does get greasy, and its great!! He showed the shampoo to his dermatologist and she was very pleased with all the ingredients!!</li>
            <li> I had looking out for a organic Dandruff shampoo for a long time.Found Jason and its been about 2 years,it has been keeping my hair clean.Good Diet and exercise also help in keeping away dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con is,this is not available easily over the counter,but has to be shipped online</li>
            <li> Quick Summary:&lt;br /&gt;  Effectiveness: Amazing results after a single use!&lt;br /&gt;  Smell: Smells nice and natural on its own. Doesn&#x27;t leave a smell in your hair very long, but I could care less anyways. Who the hell sniffs my head?&lt;br /&gt;  Look: I&#x27;m balding and this makes my hair look thicker as well as makes my hair have some volume. On top of that, my pink scalp doesn&#x27;t make it stick out anymore since it isn&#x27;t pink! Something I&#x27;ve been plagued with since high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed Version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Like most of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen here I was having horrible scalp problems, my issues though, centered more around a burning and itching scalp than dandruff (which was an issue as well, just not my primary concern). After ONE use, my first, my problems were gone, entirely. I&#x27;ve been up for two days since I used it without showering (doing hardcore final cramming, trying to graduate magna cum laude, don&#x27;t judge me!) and my head is still doing great. No dandruff, no itchiness...amazing. I&#x27;m glad my girlfriend bought this for me, otherwise I would&#x27;ve never found it.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m hearing a lot of people complain about smells or what it does to hair. Smell: No, it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like these highly commercialized shampoos, which I could care less about anyways. Regardless, it has a nice smell to it on its own, and on top of that it is all natural - awesome! What it did to my hair: I have a balding issue, I won&#x27;t lie. This stuff actually helped me a little. Now the parts of my scalp that you can see aren&#x27;t pink or red, and my hair has more lift and volume to it.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very glad I have this stuff. I&#x27;ve been converted to a JASON product user for life. The only thing I&#x27;ve ever found this amazing was a very specific Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo that cost me 30 dollars years ago, and I haven&#x27;t found it since.</li>
            <li> This shampoo resulted in a marital bedroom detante. My husband hates the smell! I have agreed to give it up because I don&#x27;t think it is doing any better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Didnt leave my hair dry and my scalp with dandruff like other shampoos. A great product&lt;br /&gt;i recommend to all naturlly curly hair types</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it did what I needed plus gives my hair anature shine, this I will get again.</li>
            <li> Totally saved my scalp this winter.  Best dandruff shampoo for the price for sure.</li>
            <li> the best product that I have ever used for my hair</li>
            <li> I as introduced to this product by my sister. When I first tried it, I could not stand the smell... but my sister swore on this shampoo, and so I could not give up on it. After a few times using it, you forget about the smell. I use it a couple times a week and it works great.</li>
            <li> Out of all the dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used and tested, this is by far the most effective ... and it&#x27;s hard to get where I live, so it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
