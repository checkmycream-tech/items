    <ol>
            <li>It provides excellent support and</li>
            <li>The doctors office was impressed</li>
            <li>The boot itself is well made and functions perfectly:</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the best part: It worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter boot, nicer, cheaper and a very good product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your great price.</li>
            <li>It makes a great travel boot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>My ankle is feeling awesome and I am sure this product helped me heal faster without the inconvenience of a plaster cast.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need it anyway, as the padding supplied and a good sock worked</li>
            <li>It fit the best, didn&#x27;t rub against my ankles.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product because it is easy to remove when changing clothes or showering.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fault of the boot</li>
            <li>I would recommend this boot to anyone with this kind of condition.</li>
            <li>works fine and gives your ankle time to heal and easy to clean and use one of the best boots on the market</li>
            <li>The quality is great, it is comfortable and most important</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, I put in about 7 miles a day wearing it at work.</li>
            <li>It got me up and out of bed and feeling better about my situation.</li>
            <li>This has been the better part of my healing process.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>In fact, there is no need for the top, removable piece at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Giving it two stars, because it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>and they wanted $200 or more for it.  </li>
            <li>Much better than paying the $225 that the pharmacy wanted to charge for this.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>My husband liked it way better and thought it was more comfortable and a better quality than the surgeon provided.  </li>
            <li>, I did some research to see if I could find a better boot.</li>
            <li>I glad I still had this in storage</li>
            <li>And the best part, it has a rocker shaped sole that makes rolling over your foot painless.</li>
            <li>so he was able to keep working even while healing from his foot problem.</li>
            <li>I felt very comfortable with all the plastic protection around my foot and it was relatively comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>However, as a walking-boot, it is MUCH more comfortable (lighter) and simpler to get on/off (three velcro straps).  </li>
            <li>Being able to pump air into the pads in the boot make it more secure and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to strap on and take off.  </li>
            <li>easy on, easy off, comfy womfy.</li>
            <li>Instead, I strongly recommend Ossur Air Equalizer</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit as well as it could but as soon as I put it on I forgot all about that.</li>
            <li>However, when the boot arrived, I noticed that the item didn&#x27;t match the description, and  as another reviewer had already objected the boot doesn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel secure wearing it.  </li>
            <li>If you watch the video (a link is available with amazon&#x27;s description of the CAM Walker)  </li>
            <li>The Ossur Rebound turned out to be the most useful of all.  </li>
            <li>Its sole and heel have great shock absorption.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, adjustable, and</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable as compared to the camo boot if you are using a knee-wheelie walker.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic boot.  </li>
            <li>The Ossur Rebound Air Walking Boot was so comfortable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I was walking virtually pain free.</li>
            <li>The velcro straps make it super easy to remove and put on as well.  </li>
            <li>I found this boot on amazon.com and decided to try it so we could have a clean one and a grubby one.  </li>
            <li>Hi Top Walking Boot Large.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as a regular shoe, but still it does work.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 10 1/2 or 11 shoe and the large fit fine.</li>
            <li>It was fine the first couple days, then after that more than 5-6hrs it would really hurt and sometimes burn.  </li>
            <li>The fit was just right, and helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This will keep you from causing more swelling by having to pump it so high for the right support.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust, and WAY better than the cast you are just getting rid of, and when you buy it here, you&#x27;re paying about a third of what the physician would charge you.  </li>
            <li>it was very tall (appropriate for my chronic achilles tendonitis) and b/c of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Thus I really didn&#x27;t use it and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I am keeping this boot handy for future injuries, knock on wood...</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that a cushion for the shin area would have been nice; had to do a make-shift pad there to prevent bruising and rubbing.</li>
            <li>I doubt the pump will last too long, but the boot itself is very good.</li>
            <li>I found this and got it right away.</li>
            <li>Making sure these lined up was what slowed me down applying the boot.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the pump fitting issue in the front plate</li>
            <li>I have used this tall air cast in the past and it works great</li>
            <li>I wore this boot for 4 weeks and then switched to a smaller more flexible Ã–ssur product.  </li>
            <li>The only way I&#x27;ve discovered to prevent this is just not to use the top piece.  </li>
            <li>First to go.</li>
            <li>Better than a standard camo boot.  </li>
            <li>When I broke my metatarsal on mu left foot, I wanted to be sure to protect it and to decrease the amount of weight that I would put on it.  </li>
            <li>For first time injurers, I can not stress enough--GO TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALIST, not just ER or GP.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this boot!!</li>
            <li>It can be used without the inner boot as your foot gets better.</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews on this boot and must say that they are correct.  </li>
            <li>While I wasn&#x27;t able to walk long distances (and took crutches for that), it made it so I could make it around the room and the resort.</li>
            <li>boot travels well, and because it only had three straps, it&#x27;s easy to adjust for comfort while in a car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It held up at work</li>
            <li>The inner liner (soft good) is very comfortable, and the front/top part of the boot has an attached pad that protects the front of the ankle - unlike nearly every other boot</li>
            <li>Watch out for sizing I&#x27;m a 11 &amp; Large</li>
            <li>The large fits up to a size 13 men&#x27;s foot -- no problem</li>
            <li>And even though it wasn&#x27;t designed to allow flexion of the ankle, it can be adjusted to allow reasonable flexion by adjusting the top belt loosely.  </li>
            <li>I was much happier with it than the boot insurance would pay for.</li>
            <li>The doctor did tell me not to use the inflation valve much as he wanted it to not be compressed.</li>
            <li>it was MUCH cheaper than the surgical pharmacy options,</li>
            <li>The boot arrived when they said and the whole process went</li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to inflate it as much.</li>
            <li>The boot is comfortable, but I wanted to point out that I actually can still ride my bike to work while wearing this.  </li>
            <li>The inflation pump works very well.</li>
            <li>I was forced to use because of a class 3 ankle sprain without good support unless if I would wear a couple layer of ace bandages.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recovering from a fractured fibula and ordered this boot after reading all  the description of this CAM Walker, particularly its design.  </li>
            <li>Main points:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>It is possible to roll forward with this boot, but you just have to lean more to the outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I also have a high instep.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are in a predicament as I have been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another, simpler boot when I broke the other ankle (don&#x27;t ask) and that simpler boot was more comfortable, supported better, and wasn&#x27;t as difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li>I was able to move around without crutches and even navigate the front steps of my porch without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li>There is a space for it to rest in the front cover but only if it is put on just right.</li>
            <li>the air bladder really hugs your foot and ankle for a snug fit that it not too tight.  </li>
            <li>This product has filled the bill extremely well.  </li>
            <li>ok, though I think if you were more active than I was, you should not expect it to last much past six weeks.</li>
            <li>The curvature of the sole helps roll you forward so you don&#x27;t spend too much time with weight on your injured side.  </li>
            <li>My husband recently had foot surgery and really needed this boot.  </li>
            <li>It never healed completely and I think it might have been because I was never put in a boot to begin with and instead in a figure 8 brace.</li>
            <li>This one far surpassed the others for me.</li>
            <li>, well, storage was kinda far, but anyways.</li>
            <li>But first I would like to say that the seller, UrgentCare Medical is responsive, as I really needed this shipped UPS (not that stupid SmartPost) and they complied getting it to me quickly and nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>At first I compensated by walking on the balls of my feet to make up the height difference but by the next day I finally \\&quot;set into my walk\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was an defect and ordered a second CAM Walker but the  second one was the same.  </li>
            <li>First non-weight bearing with crutches, then a single crutch, then a cane and finally just the walking boot.  </li>
            <li>The softgood insert needs a piece that braces the ankle and without it  the whole boot is very loose.  </li>
            <li>Makes your foot look robotic but really does provide protection.</li>
            <li>The pump at the top of this boot front is poorly positioned if you are NWB and rely on a knee scooter to get around.</li>
            <li>comfortable, stiff and &amp;#34;easy-on, easy-off.&amp;#34; However, the air pump, which functions well enough, is not rugged enough.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know enough to order my own boot before my checkup with the doctor, and this was the one I got issued.</li>
            <li>It inflates around your ankle tightly so you don&#x27;t put too much weight on your foot, but rather your ankle takes it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I sprained my ankle pretty bad (upper ankle sprain and a grade 3 lower sprain).  I found this and got it right away. I was worried that it would be clunky when I walked. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought. Within a few hours I was walking around without a problem. At first I compensated by walking on the balls of my feet to make up the height difference but by the next day I finally \\&quot;set into my walk\\&quot;.  I did notice a bit of back stress from having to adjust my walk and stance but that will happen with any boot.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a men&#x27;s size 12w.  I also have a high instep. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit as well as it could but as soon as I put it on I forgot all about that. The air pump works! It helps fill in the empty space within the boot.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I found a bit difficult and restricting is where the pump meets the front of the boot.  There is a space for it to rest in the front cover but only if it is put on just right. Making sure these lined up was what slowed me down applying the boot.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the pump fitting issue in the front plate I am very pleased with this product. It got me up and out of bed and feeling better about my situation. This has been the better part of my healing process.&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find a chest piece and bracers so I can take on a bear!</li>
            <li> On Thanksgiving of this year (11/24/11), I fractured my ankle after rolling it while running on an uneven surface.  My orthopedic surgeon prescribed me this boot and told me to wear it whenever I was on my feet and even while sleeping if I could tolerate it.  It is a great product because it is easy to remove when changing clothes or showering.  It provides excellent support and the air bladder really hugs your foot and ankle for a snug fit that it not too tight.  The velcro straps make it super easy to remove and put on as well.  I was able to move around without crutches and even navigate the front steps of my porch without too much trouble.  The curvature of the sole helps roll you forward so you don&#x27;t spend too much time with weight on your injured side.  My only complaint and it&#x27;s a minor one, is the height of the sole.  None of my shoes matched it so I always felt like I was higher on the injured side, but it didn&#x27;t really make it uncomfortable or annoying.  I wore this boot for 4 weeks and then switched to a smaller more flexible Ã–ssur product.  My ankle is feeling awesome and I am sure this product helped me heal faster without the inconvenience of a plaster cast.  I am keeping this boot handy for future injuries, knock on wood...</li>
            <li> The pump at the top of this boot front is poorly positioned if you are NWB and rely on a knee scooter to get around. Both the pump and the fixed raised collar in the plastic shield under it press into the top of the shin bone when using the scooter- very painful!  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know enough to order my own boot before my checkup with the doctor, and this was the one I got issued. Terrible design, and best to get something else if you use a knee scooter!</li>
            <li> The plastic top piece pushes down on my toes, causing pain in them over time unrelated to my broken ankle.  The only way I&#x27;ve discovered to prevent this is just not to use the top piece.  In fact, there is no need for the top, removable piece at all.  I&#x27;ve used another, simpler boot when I broke the other ankle (don&#x27;t ask) and that simpler boot was more comfortable, supported better, and wasn&#x27;t as difficult to put on.  I had the short version of this boot for a broken great toe, and couldn&#x27;t wear it because it put pressure on it that made it painful to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it two stars, because it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My husband recently had foot surgery and really needed this boot.  I called everywhere and they wanted $200 or more for it.  Thank you for your great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recovering from a fractured fibula and ordered this boot after reading all  the description of this CAM Walker, particularly its design.  I also watched a  video on-line about the boot.  However, when the boot arrived, I noticed that the item didn&#x27;t match the description, and  as another reviewer had already objected the boot doesn&#x27;t fit well and therefore it hurts a lot  to walk with it.  The softgood insert needs a piece that braces the ankle and without it  the whole boot is very loose.  I didn&#x27;t feel secure wearing it.  At first, I thought it was an defect and ordered a second CAM Walker but the  second one was the same.  I contacted Ossur and the Seller but never got an answer  from either one.  If you watch the video (a link is available with amazon&#x27;s description of the CAM Walker)  you&#x27;ll notice that it should have a middle softgood piece.  Instead, I strongly recommend Ossur Air Equalizer Hi Top Walking Boot Large.  It&#x27;s a lighter boot, nicer, cheaper and a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 different boots for my healing ruptured Achilles Tendon.  The Ossur Rebound turned out to be the most useful of all.  It gives not only 360 degree protection, but it has a front bumper, and its front/top piece covers and hides the toes as well.  It attaches with three belts - nearly every other boot requires five belts to attach.  The belts don&#x27;t detach from the boot - so they won&#x27;t get lost or require re-positioning.  Its sole and heel have great shock absorption.  The inner liner (soft good) is very comfortable, and the front/top part of the boot has an attached pad that protects the front of the ankle - unlike nearly every other boot, it doesn&#x27;t require extra pads to protect the front of the ankle.  And even though it wasn&#x27;t designed to allow flexion of the ankle, it can be adjusted to allow reasonable flexion by adjusting the top belt loosely.  It makes a great travel boot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I was coming out of my cast for a shattered heal. The doctors office was impressed and although I paid for it out of pocket I was much happier with it than the boot insurance would pay for. I felt very comfortable with all the plastic protection around my foot and it was relatively comfortable to wear. The doctor did tell me not to use the inflation valve much as he wanted it to not be compressed. Thus I really didn&#x27;t use it and it worked just fine. I also bought a Ossur open tipped boot but never used it after starting with this one. Makes your foot look robotic but really does provide protection. I wear a size 10 1/2 or 11 shoe and the large fit fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this tall air cast in the past and it works great</li>
            <li> The Air pump did not work it just made noise.  I was forced to use because of a class 3 ankle sprain without good support unless if I would wear a couple layer of ace bandages.  I wish I could have returned it but I had to use something  to go up and down the stairs to my second floor apartment.  I hope I never have an injury like this again but if I do I will get another brand of boot.</li>
            <li> Got it for a sprained ankle and it didn&#x27;t help at all.  The support is not very good.  The air leaks slowly.</li>
            <li> hard bottom compared tp other boots. Watch out for sizing I&#x27;m a 11 &amp; Large was too small</li>
            <li> I chose this boot b/c it was MUCH cheaper than the surgical pharmacy options, b/c it was very tall (appropriate for my chronic achilles tendonitis) and b/c of the positive reviews. The boot itself is well made and functions perfectly: comfortable, stiff and &amp;#34;easy-on, easy-off.&amp;#34; However, the air pump, which functions well enough, is not rugged enough. (It&#x27;s adjustments work well within the boot for my medium weight leg.) The front L plate of the boot moves around a bit, no matter how hard it is cinched down. The pump bulb and deflation button poke through cutouts in this plate and are constantly rubbed and scaped by it. It still functions, but it is torn up after 3 weeks and is about to break. Annoyingly, if the front plate covers the bulb a bit, it will pump itself up as you walk sometimes!! I doubt the pump will last too long, but the boot itself is very good. One warning: the footbed/sole under the bottom of the boot foot is thick, so to avoid hurting your back and hips with long term use, you will need a quite thick sole on your other shoe to walk evenly.</li>
            <li> Had to use this for 2 months.  Comfortable, adjustable, and here&#x27;s the best part: It worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on or take off.  Easy to adjust, and WAY better than the cast you are just getting rid of, and when you buy it here, you&#x27;re paying about a third of what the physician would charge you.  Where do you think he buys his supply?  Duh!!</li>
            <li> The fit was just right, and helped tremendously.  Much better than paying the $225 that the pharmacy wanted to charge for this.  Only drawback is that a cushion for the shin area would have been nice; had to do a make-shift pad there to prevent bruising and rubbing.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, I put in about 7 miles a day wearing it at work.</li>
            <li> I wore this boot for four weeks, after  spraining my ankle severely. I traveled some in it, and also did some foreman work on construction sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air pump thingy? A gimmick.  First to go. I didn&#x27;t need it anyway, as the padding supplied and a good sock worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boot travels well, and because it only had three straps, it&#x27;s easy to adjust for comfort while in a car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It held up at work ok, though I think if you were more active than I was, you should not expect it to last much past six weeks. The hook and loop straps were getting a bit iffy for me at four weeks, and the tread was wearing thin at the heel.&lt;br /&gt;Working comfort was not perfect: it tends to chafe the front of your shin, so, an extra tall sock, and softer jeans helps.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fault of the boot, I think that&#x27;s just the nature of wearing a contraption like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for fifty dollars, hey, you can buy three or four of these boots for what you will pay for an equivalent at your doctors office. It&#x27;s a great value. And if you wear through three or four of these boots, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had to wear this due to a partial tear.  It was fine the first couple days, then after that more than 5-6hrs it would really hurt and sometimes burn.  My doctor told me just take it off at night (which I did anyways in bed) and put powder on the leg as well as do the same before you put it on.  That helped.  Man I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of this.</li>
            <li> It was for a friend that had a serious issue in his left leg. It was suggested by a doctor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to have to sport a walking boot this is your pick.  Easy to strap on and take off.  Comfy.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Better than a standard camo boot.  (Broke my navicular bone, put back together with screws).  Not as comfortable as compared to the camo boot if you are using a knee-wheelie walker.  The air pump and valve dig into your shin.  However, as a walking-boot, it is MUCH more comfortable (lighter) and simpler to get on/off (three velcro straps).  The large fits up to a size 13 men&#x27;s foot -- no problem</li>
            <li> I ordered this boot because my Dr. told me that it would cost a lot less if I did.  I found the boot and ordered it.  The boot arrived when they said and the whole process went very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now out of my boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> When I broke my metatarsal on mu left foot, I wanted to be sure to protect it and to decrease the amount of weight that I would put on it.  First non-weight bearing with crutches, then a single crutch, then a cane and finally just the walking boot.  This product has filled the bill extremely well.  Being able to pump air into the pads in the boot make it more secure and comfortable.  I highly recommend this if you are in a predicament as I have been.</li>
            <li> Main points:&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy a soft pad (or use a few sponges) near ankle so you don&#x27;t have to inflate it as much. They give you one, but it isn&#x27;t enough. This will keep you from causing more swelling by having to pump it so high for the right support.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wear a tall shoe on opposite foot.&lt;br /&gt;3. Learn to walk in it! It is possible to roll forward with this boot, but you just have to lean more to the outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t miss this step in recovery--it makes it so your ankle gets used to weight bearing again before having to do ALL of the heavy work.&lt;br /&gt;5. When in doubt, pick this over the short walker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell down stairs and landed directly on my right ankle a few years back. It never healed completely and I think it might have been because I was never put in a boot to begin with and instead in a figure 8 brace. For first time injurers, I can not stress enough--GO TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALIST, not just ER or GP. You will regret it for years if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I re-injured my ankle and plantar fascia two weeks before a [non-refundable] trip to Cabo. This boot saved the trip. While I wasn&#x27;t able to walk long distances (and took crutches for that), it made it so I could make it around the room and the resort. Cut off the front of the boot whether you think you need to or not--trust me.</li>
            <li> My husband had a severe chain saw injury on his foot.  The orthopedic surgeon provided him with a walking boot from his office at a cost of $225.00.  We work outside a lot and I was having to wash it every evening.  I found this boot on amazon.com and decided to try it so we could have a clean one and a grubby one.  This is a fantastic boot.  My husband liked it way better and thought it was more comfortable and a better quality than the surgeon provided.  We paid $58.00 for this one.  Highly recommend this boot!!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with a bad case of Achilles Tendonitis for months. My Podiatrist put me into another type of walking cam boot. It  helped alot with allowing me to walk with less pain but I found it to be uncomfortable and it allowed to much movement in the heel area. The excessive movement still made it painful to walk. I knew I would have stay in the boot for an extended length of time so, I did some research to see if I could find a better boot. I found the Ossur Rebound Air Walking Boot, read everything about it and deceided to try it. The day that it arrived I unpacked it, put it on, pumped it up with air and started to walk around. The difference between the boots was like night and day. The Ossur Rebound Air Walking Boot was so comfortable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I was walking virtually pain free. The boot holds the foot and the achilles together so there is no movement. This makes it less painful. I would recommend this boot to anyone with this kind of condition.</li>
            <li> torn Achilles, need reconstructive surgery. until then, I use this boot. works perfectly. easy on, easy off, comfy womfy. heck, I go walking on the hike/bike path 2 miles a day wearing it and no pain or discomfprt at all. i&#x27;ll buy another one cuz all the walking i&#x27;m doing is wearing the bottom down, but if you just wear it like a normal person for rehab or what have you, it will last long time. just like me!</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews on this boot and must say that they are correct.  But first I would like to say that the seller, UrgentCare Medical is responsive, as I really needed this shipped UPS (not that stupid SmartPost) and they complied getting it to me quickly and nicely packaged.  The boot is comfortable, but I wanted to point out that I actually can still ride my bike to work while wearing this.  Not as good as a regular shoe, but still it does work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, had to use this for a torn achilles, didnt use it too long because it is taller than other boots and throws off your back. U need to wear an equal height shoe with this boot. Otherwise it serves its purpose</li>
            <li> Tried 4 different ones. 2 from the doctors. This one far surpassed the others for me. It fit the best, didn&#x27;t rub against my ankles. It can be used without the inner boot as your foot gets better. Actually, I broke my foot again 2 years later, and boy was I glad I still had this in storage, well, storage was kinda far, but anyways. The inner boot is breathable. It&#x27;s not neoprene, tho similar. The inflation pump works very well. It inflates around your ankle tightly so you don&#x27;t put too much weight on your foot, but rather your ankle takes it. And the best part, it has a rocker shaped sole that makes rolling over your foot painless. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t need crutches with this boot on. Tip. don&#x27;t throw it away after using it. You may injure your foot again.</li>
            <li> works fine and gives your ankle time to heal and easy to clean and use one of the best boots on the market</li>
            <li> My husband loves his boot, even though he has to wear it. The quality is great, it is comfortable and most important it is covered with hard plastic so he was able to keep working even while healing from his foot problem. Great job!</li>
