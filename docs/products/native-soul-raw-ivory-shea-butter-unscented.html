            <li>/&gt;i recommend this product to everyone that wants beautiful and supple skin!!!</li>
            <li>THE BEST FOR SENSITIVE, PROBLEMATIC SKIN!</li>
            <li>I am also excited to try this in both lip balm recipes and a homemade soap recipe, I am sure if will be great in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pure shea nut butter is a great value, large size (1 lb) and best of all....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for pure unrefined shea butter, this one is a good bet!</li>
            <li>Had eczema, but this has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li>but it was much more costly for just a &#x27;chunk&#x27; of butter in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Really love this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I came across this one and just love</li>
            <li>and it just feels better on your skin.  </li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>; okay.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review&amp;#34;  I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li>I also love how there&#x27;s no scent (or none that I can detect).</li>
            <li>Many of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; shea butter products come packed in a plastic bag or cheap container, this product is packaged in a nice resealable container to stay fresh.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I applied it immediately after a bath and my skin feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>In summary, Native Soul shea butter is high quality shea nut butter, and it is great for aged/dried skin.  </li>
            <li>nice to see a full size product for this price.  </li>
            <li>Awesome stuff for dry skin....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for combining with essential oils to make your own beauty products.</li>
            <li>Great product by far.</li>
            <li>and you have to warm it up on your skin, but then it just melts right into your skin, without feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beside been completely natural is very effective to the point</li>
            <li>I put it on at night in combination with other things and the best thing is......</li>
            <li>It is odorless and non greasy and absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>Although it isn&#x27;t easy to get out of the tub.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality moisturizer and a pea size goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it as an ingredient in some skin care recipes I have, but this stuff is pretty amazing by itself.</li>
            <li>I used to order from a pretty popular site</li>
            <li>Just warm it up a bit in your hands first.  </li>
            <li>I use more than that since I&#x27;m using it as a full body moisturizer, but it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The price is a fantastic deal because</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great, but doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feel some products can leave.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I use the plastic cap to scoop out the &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; so I can rub them into a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Not a strong scent which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased a few more jars just in case everybody gets wind of how good this product is sold out!</li>
            <li>has an inner sealing disk, very nice.</li>
            <li>Love the product, thanks so much for a great pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>This while remaining 100% Pure &amp; Unrefined with no additives and preservatives, which is very important to my family.</li>
            <li>after using this almost a month the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders, my skin feels amazing and just a teeny amount goes so far!</li>
            <li>Shea is so moisturizing and makes your skin feel soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>is a lot of cool Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I was told this is a good overall product and</li>
            <li>I am pleased with how much I received.  </li>
            <li>and she really likes how much more rejuvenated the skin on her legs and arms has become since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The best part is even after a day of outside chores and washing dishes, I only have to use it once!</li>
            <li>The best part is it only takes a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Applying it daily will greatly improve the quality of your skin, and I highly recommend this native soul shea butter!</li>
            <li>Pleasant texture, nice light color, very little graininess which is natural to shea.</li>
            <li>We use it for homemade soaps and moisturizers and saw great results after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there are no dyes or perfumes so my husband, our 2 month old, and myself can all use it without worries.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s called butter because it melts and is absorbed  into my calloused feet and hands.</li>
            <li>I like that you can add your own essential oils for scent.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have also used it to moisturize my skin right after my shower or bath because it seals in moisture</li>
            <li>of the reasons I choose this brand in particular are that it is 100% shea butter, it is unrefined, and hexane free.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how smooth and pleasant smelling Raw Ivory Shea Butter by Native Soul Body Care is!</li>
            <li>These are important things to look for in a high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>Does not take as much when applying to my skin and  absorbs  quickly with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>We live in an area where it takes most items about twice the normal delivery time, but this product came ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>I have used many of the other Shea Butters available.</li>
            <li>Product top quality and definitely will buy from again although it will be awhile.</li>
            <li>I use this on my skin and my hair, for a deep condition (is so much better than using a hot oil treatment for hair).  </li>
            <li>This is a whole lot of Shea butter!</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Comes off as crumbly at first</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and provides a natural layer of protection and keeps moisture in his skin.</li>
            <li>This is natural and so smooth and this is gonna be one stop solution to all my beauty needs.</li>
            <li>Love it totally.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe that a bit on my finger tips was all it took.  </li>
            <li>Pretty package.  </li>
            <li>It is very luxurious!</li>
            <li>I use it on my 3C black/mixed hair and it makes my hair feel much softer, and moisturizes my ends!</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and my skin is much softer by using it.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>No unnecessary ingredients, just pure Shea!</li>
            <li>I love using it on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again, once I run out of this pretty decent sized tub.</li>
            <li>Very high quality Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I will not use any other cream, I&#x27;m smooth and feeling more confident than usual.</li>
            <li>This is a huge tub of shea  butter and it will last forever</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Works very well on diminishing surgical scars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have any smell to it</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and my hands are still relatively smooth and moist even after washing them several times a day.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I have been using it over a week now and my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>As nice as it smells, it&#x27;s external use only, so don&#x27;t plan on eating it!</li>
            <li>It would make a good carrier for essential oils if it were gently heated and blended with other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried some applied directly to my hands and it works extremely well at moisturizing and it is still effective through repeated hand washing.  </li>
            <li>My legs are always dry, but this stuff works very quickly to change that.</li>
            <li>The butter absorbed quickly and left my hands soft the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well as my body and so far I have had no reaction which is a first.</li>
            <li>Most other moisturizers I have tried require repeat applications, but not this!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>You can tell this is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>also I was always itchy because of the dryness and this stop as well highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>As a lotion, it makes my skin incredibly soft, with no slimy/oily feeling!</li>
            <li>No heavy scent just pretty white shea butter.</li>
            <li>This pure shea butter has a pleasant natural scent and a texture that is neither hard nor gooey - almost fluffy before it warms and softens in my hands.</li>
            <li>When used I rub it between my hands until clear and then apply and it has no scent.</li>
            <li>My daughter has natural hair and it seals in moisture.</li>
            <li>this product made my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>When I find a natural product that works, I want to tell everyone that I know.  </li>
            <li>now her cheeks are completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>Using this product in conjunction with a mixture of other pure nut oils has really helped moisturize my hair since I&#x27;ve decided to stop getting it relaxed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of all the high ratings, and no low ratings.</li>
            <li>initially bought this product for my eczema/ psoriasis sensitive skin face</li>
            <li>It comes in a large tub and it will last us a very long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and smooth, but not rock hard like other raw shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin.     </li>

            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I use the plastic cap to scoop out the &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; so I can rub them into a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Not a strong scent which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased a few more jars just in case everybody gets wind of how good this product is sold out!</li>
            <li> has an inner sealing disk, very nice.</li>
            <li> Love the product, thanks so much for a great pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> This while remaining 100% Pure &amp; Unrefined with no additives and preservatives, which is very important to my family.</li>
            <li> after using this almost a month the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders, my skin feels amazing and just a teeny amount goes so far!</li>
            <li> Shea is so moisturizing and makes your skin feel soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> is a lot of cool Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I was told this is a good overall product and</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how much I received.  </li>
            <li> and she really likes how much more rejuvenated the skin on her legs and arms has become since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The best part is even after a day of outside chores and washing dishes, I only have to use it once!</li>
            <li> The best part is it only takes a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Applying it daily will greatly improve the quality of your skin, and I highly recommend this native soul shea butter!</li>
            <li> Pleasant texture, nice light color, very little graininess which is natural to shea.</li>
            <li> We use it for homemade soaps and moisturizers and saw great results after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are no dyes or perfumes so my husband, our 2 month old, and myself can all use it without worries.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s called butter because it melts and is absorbed  into my calloused feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I like that you can add your own essential oils for scent.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have also used it to moisturize my skin right after my shower or bath because it seals in moisture</li>
            <li> of the reasons I choose this brand in particular are that it is 100% shea butter, it is unrefined, and hexane free.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how smooth and pleasant smelling Raw Ivory Shea Butter by Native Soul Body Care is!</li>
            <li> These are important things to look for in a high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Does not take as much when applying to my skin and  absorbs  quickly with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> We live in an area where it takes most items about twice the normal delivery time, but this product came ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> I have used many of the other Shea Butters available.</li>
            <li> Product top quality and definitely will buy from again although it will be awhile.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin and my hair, for a deep condition (is so much better than using a hot oil treatment for hair).  </li>
            <li> This is a whole lot of Shea butter!</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Comes off as crumbly at first</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and provides a natural layer of protection and keeps moisture in his skin.</li>
            <li> This is natural and so smooth and this is gonna be one stop solution to all my beauty needs.</li>
            <li> Love it totally.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe that a bit on my finger tips was all it took.  </li>
            <li> Pretty package.  </li>
            <li> It is very luxurious!</li>
            <li> I use it on my 3C black/mixed hair and it makes my hair feel much softer, and moisturizes my ends!</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and my skin is much softer by using it.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> No unnecessary ingredients, just pure Shea!</li>
            <li> I love using it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, once I run out of this pretty decent sized tub.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other cream, I&#x27;m smooth and feeling more confident than usual.</li>
            <li> This is a huge tub of shea  butter and it will last forever</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have any smell to it</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and my hands are still relatively smooth and moist even after washing them several times a day.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> I have been using it over a week now and my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> As nice as it smells, it&#x27;s external use only, so don&#x27;t plan on eating it!</li>
            <li> It would make a good carrier for essential oils if it were gently heated and blended with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried some applied directly to my hands and it works extremely well at moisturizing and it is still effective through repeated hand washing.  </li>
            <li> My legs are always dry, but this stuff works very quickly to change that.</li>
            <li> The butter absorbed quickly and left my hands soft the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well as my body and so far I have had no reaction which is a first.</li>
            <li> Most other moisturizers I have tried require repeat applications, but not this!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> also I was always itchy because of the dryness and this stop as well highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> As a lotion, it makes my skin incredibly soft, with no slimy/oily feeling!</li>
            <li> No heavy scent just pretty white shea butter.</li>
            <li> This pure shea butter has a pleasant natural scent and a texture that is neither hard nor gooey - almost fluffy before it warms and softens in my hands.</li>
            <li> When used I rub it between my hands until clear and then apply and it has no scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter has natural hair and it seals in moisture.</li>
            <li> this product made my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> When I find a natural product that works, I want to tell everyone that I know.  </li>
            <li> now her cheeks are completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Using this product in conjunction with a mixture of other pure nut oils has really helped moisturize my hair since I&#x27;ve decided to stop getting it relaxed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the high ratings, and no low ratings.</li>
            <li> initially bought this product for my eczema/ psoriasis sensitive skin face</li>
            <li> It comes in a large tub and it will last us a very long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and smooth, but not rock hard like other raw shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> Really like this product and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> my daughter used to have such dry itchy skin on her cheeks that she would constantly scratch at it taking the skin off and all.</li>
            <li> I have really dry rough elbows and when I used this on my elbows it made them soft and smoothe.  </li>
            <li> , it last on skin and keeps your skin moisturized for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy shea butter for a long time and finally got this one.</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday and it will definitely last a long while.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate, as well as heating our home with a wood stove which make the air very dry and the shea butter has made drastic improvements with our dry skin!  </li>
            <li> This tub is going to last me a LONG time!</li>
            <li> They are so dry that the skins splits open.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to try it out.</li>
            <li> I plan on using some of it to make some soap, but I am saving some for when I have been outdoors too long.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time between applications.</li>
            <li> After I tried this I&amp;#34;m never going back to the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hands which tend to be extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my daughter who has really dry skin..</li>
            <li> I have also been using a dab on my lips as a way to combat dry lips.</li>
            <li> helped with his dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I used to have a small business making and selling soaps, lotions and ointments where I would buy 50 pounds of Shea at a time directly from Africa.</li>
            <li> Even on a cold morning without heating I can get some easily out of the jar and on my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin and just a pea size amount of this shea butter</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry to the point of cracking and since I started using this product a couple of days ago I can see the difference</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin year round and have used countless products with no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on some stretchmarks, but I will have to report back in a few weeks to see if there is any change</li>
            <li> This is very solid Shea Butter, which I assume will mean it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as oily as the other stuff</li>
            <li> I can use it on my face or hair (a little will go a very long way) without issues.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and I have purchased a handful of different creams: raw Shea butter, raw cocoa butter, coconut butter, aloe vera butter etc.</li>
            <li> now go read some other peoples reviews.. as this wasn&#x27;t a product I used myself!</li>
            <li> but it had cocunut oil and a few other things added in.  </li>
            <li> The thing about buying stuff for family members.. is that making the review under your account feels odd..</li>
            <li> but it is not even half as moisturizing as shea butter.</li>
            <li> She will be using this and a little vitamin E to help reduce the appearance of the scar.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few day&#x27;s now &amp; can already feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked well on sun/wind dried skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for  a few months</li>
            <li> A few times a week, after each shower she applies the shea butter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unscented in it&#x27;s raw form.</li>
            <li> you have never given Raw Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve spend thousand of dollar literally trying to find relief, unfortunately some of the stuff I&#x27;ve use only worsen the situation.</li>
            <li> eczema stop burning and chaffing my skin, and my stretch are smoothing (no more of the itching scar feeling, I can tell stretch marks will diminish)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shea butter from Native Soul, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I am so late on this product</li>
            <li> I figured I would at least try.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is creamy but thick.</li>
            <li> Greasy as all shea is, use a very small amount and don&#x27;t get it on your palms because it doesn&#x27;t absorb there!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so the company means it when they say begin with a pea sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Faint smell</li>
            <li> So versatile, because it helps with all kinds of troubled skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Native Soul!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is best quality Shea Butter that I have used. My daughter has natural hair and it seals in moisture. My hair is relaxed and it keeps it moist also. I have noticed growth since I have been using it. I have also used it to moisturize my skin right after my shower or bath because it seals in moisture and I notice my skin looks younger. I am going to have my husband try it as a shaving cream and I will write a review on that later. Fast service. Product top quality and definitely will buy from again although it will be awhile.This stuff lasts. Its consistency is creamy but thick. When used I rub it between my hands until clear and then apply and it has no scent. It is great for Winter skin. So an A-plus product hope this helped someone.</li>
            <li> My family had heard about the benefits of shea butter and we tried this product.  We love it!  We live in a very dry climate, as well as heating our home with a wood stove which make the air very dry and the shea butter has made drastic improvements with our dry skin!  I love the fact that there are no dyes or perfumes so my husband, our 2 month old, and myself can all use it without worries.  It has also helped our daughter with her cradle cap!  We live in an area where it takes most items about twice the normal delivery time, but this product came ahead of schedule.  The inner plastic lid is a bonus as well because it keeps the shea butter moist when my husband forgets to close the lid!</li>
            <li> Works very well on diminishing surgical scars. No unnecessary ingredients, just pure Shea! Everything else by comparison is just Vaseline!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for dry skin.... We use it for homemade soaps and moisturizers and saw great results after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again and recommend others.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very best Shea Butters I have ever used!  I use this on my skin and my hair, for a deep condition (is so much better than using a hot oil treatment for hair).  The price is a fantastic deal because 16 oz. is a lot of cool Shea Butter.  I highly recommend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li> The best shea butter&lt;br /&gt;My Shea butter arrived quickly. This is a whole lot of Shea butter! More than I expected. Native Soul is one of the best Shea butters I have tried. I use it on my hands which tend to be extremely dry. The butter absorbed quickly and left my hands soft the rest of the day. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> this product made my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this product for my eczema/ psoriasis sensitive skin face&lt;br /&gt;but will also try on hair try on stretch marks still waiting for good results&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product to everyone that wants beautiful and supple skin!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for a number of years. I use it on my body and my daughter who has really dry skin.. I used to order from a pretty popular site but it was much more costly for just a &#x27;chunk&#x27; of butter in a plastic bag. THIS shea butter is just as good, priced great and the packaging is much more appealing, I feel it&#x27;ll stay fresher longer in this jar. If you&#x27;re looking for pure unrefined shea butter, this one is a good bet!</li>
            <li> Really love this shea butter. I have been using it for a few day&#x27;s now &amp; can already feel a difference in my skin. I suffer from extremely dry skin year round and have used countless products with no results.A friend recommended shea butter. I came across this one and just love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s unscented in it&#x27;s raw form. Does not take as much when applying to my skin and  absorbs  quickly with no greasy feel. Great price for a 16 oz. jar.I highly recommend this shea butter from Native Soul, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.Will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> This is very solid Shea Butter, which I assume will mean it will last longer. I plan to use it to make homemade soap for my family. It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The thing about buying stuff for family members.. is that making the review under your account feels odd..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that.. I was told this is a good overall product and the price was on the mark making it a good deal.. now go read some other peoples reviews.. as this wasn&#x27;t a product I used myself!</li>
            <li> Really like this product and a little goes a long way.  I think it&#x27;s called butter because it melts and is absorbed  into my calloused feet and hands. Blends good-l I&#x27;ve added a multitude of essential oils to create a fragrant body butter depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is simply amazing.  I&#x27;ve used Shea Butter before and like it but it had cocunut oil and a few other things added in.  After I tried this I&amp;#34;m never going back to the other stuff.  100% Shea Butter is the way to go.  It&#x27;s not as oily as the other stuff and it just feels better on your skin.  Great for foot-rubs, cracked hands, backrubs, and your skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never given Raw Shea Butter a try you need to.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> As a first time user of shea butter, I have been impressed with the versatility of this product! I love using it on dry skin. It is odorless and non greasy and absorbs into my skin very quickly. The best part is even after a day of outside chores and washing dishes, I only have to use it once! Most other moisturizers I have tried require repeat applications, but not this! I have also been using a dab on my lips as a way to combat dry lips. Not only does it work great, but doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feel some products can leave. I have also used this on my children&#x27;s cheeks as a windburn preventative and plan on getting a lot of use out of it during the winter. The best part is it only takes a tiny amount. This tub is going to last me a LONG time! I am also excited to try this in both lip balm recipes and a homemade soap recipe, I am sure if will be great in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reasons I choose this brand in particular are that it is 100% shea butter, it is unrefined, and hexane free. These are important things to look for in a high quality shea butter. Considering the multitude of uses for this product, I plan on keeping a tub around at all times! Can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use. It really works well. Buy this. You will be glad you did. Jst don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It does exactly what it says. My skin looks healthy! I&#x27;m very impressed with this product! My skin is clearer. Had eczema, but this has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li> I use only on my hands now. Gritty, but overall its &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; okay. Wouldn&#x27;t fully recommend, maybe its just my skin. Great hand moisturizer but leaves sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Works wonders, my skin feels amazing and just a teeny amount goes so far! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how much I received.  It worked well on sun/wind dried skin.  I like that you can add your own essential oils for scent.  I plan on using some of it to make some soap, but I am saving some for when I have been outdoors too long.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I always have problem with my skin, whether it&#x27;s the eczema breakout or my stretchmarks. Over the years I&#x27;ve spend thousand of dollar literally trying to find relief, unfortunately some of the stuff I&#x27;ve use only worsen the situation. Searching through Amazon yet for another skin product I came across this Native Soul Shea product with only 6 review, I made the purchase, the product came in time. This cream is UNSCENTED, NON GREASY, AND MELT THROUG MY SKIN LIKE WHIP BUTTER (you need to rub it through) I use it on my skin, face (not hair yet) eczema stop burning and chaffing my skin, and my stretch are smoothing (no more of the itching scar feeling, I can tell stretch marks will diminish) THE BEST FOR SENSITIVE, PROBLEMATIC SKIN! I will not use any other cream, I&#x27;m smooth and feeling more confident than usual.</li>
            <li> I used to have a small business making and selling soaps, lotions and ointments where I would buy 50 pounds of Shea at a time directly from Africa. Since I don&#x27;t buy wholesale quantities anymore, I was hesitant to try any retail products because I know the variation in quality, texture, and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was great. Pleasant texture, nice light color, very little graininess which is natural to shea. Faint smell, it&#x27;s not one of those overly musky unrefined shea smells.  Greasy as all shea is, use a very small amount and don&#x27;t get it on your palms because it doesn&#x27;t absorb there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jar has an inner sealing disk, very nice. I ordered this even knowing that there might be problems with shipping in 100F temperatures, but the product came in perfect condition, no excess melting.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review&amp;#34;  I really love this product. It absorbs easily and makes my skin feel great. Not a strong scent which is perfect for me. It&#x27;s great for combining with essential oils to make your own beauty products.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter in my whipped coconut oil body butter and this is amazing.  Goes on smooth and lasts all day!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Native Soul!</li>
            <li> When I find a natural product that works, I want to tell everyone that I know.  This is definitely one of those products!  I have tried some applied directly to my hands and it works extremely well at moisturizing and it is still effective through repeated hand washing.  I am looking forward to trying this in some homemade soap too.</li>
            <li> my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin.     UPDATE: after using this almost a month the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly.  my daughter used to have such dry itchy skin on her cheeks that she would constantly scratch at it taking the skin off and all. now her cheeks are completely cleared up. this definitely soothed it and helped her to heal up. i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality moisturizer and a pea size goes a long way. Comes off as crumbly at first but when you rub it between your palm it melts and glides on your skin, it last on skin and keeps your skin moisturized for a long time.  I don&#x27;t regret giving it a try, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I am so late on this product but I wish that I have found this item sooner. I use to use olive oil but it is not even half as moisturizing as shea butter. I put it on at night in combination with other things and the best thing is......it does not break me out. It took care of my oil/dry combination skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I use it for my son who has eczema. It goes on smoothly and provides a natural layer of protection and keeps moisture in his skin. It also lasts a long time between applications. It comes in a large tub and it will last us a very long time! Great value!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shea butter and a good value! I take one part shea butter and one part virgin coconut oil and mix together for my body lotion. The results are wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a huge tub of shea  butter and it will last forever but it&#x27;s worth it. Shea is so moisturizing and makes your skin feel soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy shea butter for a long time and finally got this one. It&#x27;s amazing. I wanted to use it as an ingredient in some skin care recipes I have, but this stuff is pretty amazing by itself. My husband has very dry skin and just a pea size amount of this shea butter helped with his dry cracked hands. It doesn&#x27;t really have any smell to it and you have to warm it up on your skin, but then it just melts right into your skin, without feeling greasy at all. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in creams, but I might just use it the way it is. Although it isn&#x27;t easy to get out of the tub. It is very solid. But it is great for the skin. So versatile, because it helps with all kinds of troubled skin. I will buy it again, once I run out of this pretty decent sized tub.</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter Ever. This is natural and so smooth and this is gonna be one stop solution to all my beauty needs. Love it totally.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how this shea butter made my skin feel.  I have really dry rough elbows and when I used this on my elbows it made them soft and smoothe.  Plus a little goes a long way.  The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe that a bit on my finger tips was all it took.  Love the product, thanks so much for a great pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and I have purchased a handful of different creams: raw Shea butter, raw cocoa butter, coconut butter, aloe vera butter etc. I purchased this because of all the high ratings, and no low ratings. I figured I would at least try. It arrived and it is really amazing. I have used it every day. There is no odor. My skin has not become irritated. I use it on my face as well as my body and so far I have had no reaction which is a first. I use a hair dryer on it in the morning for 30 seconds to soften it. The consistency is just fine for me. Even on a cold morning without heating I can get some easily out of the jar and on my skin. It lasts all day, and my hands are still relatively smooth and moist even after washing them several times a day. I went ahead and purchased a few more jars just in case everybody gets wind of how good this product is sold out! I give it an 11 out of 10. It also arrived quickly and was packaged well. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> shea butter&lt;br /&gt;great product. Pretty package.  nice to see a full size product for this price.  No heavy scent just pretty white shea butter. Great for all my crafty stuff I make.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  It&#x27;s rich and smooth, but not rock hard like other raw shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, there is no noticeable smell, which I appreciate.  It is very thick, so the company means it when they say begin with a pea sized amount.  I use more than that since I&#x27;m using it as a full body moisturizer, but it works fine.  Just warm it up a bit in your hands first.  It is very luxurious!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. As a lotion, it makes my skin incredibly soft, with no slimy/oily feeling! I use it on my 3C black/mixed hair and it makes my hair feel much softer, and moisturizes my ends! Using this product in conjunction with a mixture of other pure nut oils has really helped moisturize my hair since I&#x27;ve decided to stop getting it relaxed. I&#x27;ve also been using it on some stretchmarks, but I will have to report back in a few weeks to see if there is any change, I&#x27;ve not noticed anything yet. It does have a crumbly texture that takes some getting used to. I use the plastic cap to scoop out the &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; so I can rub them into a smooth texture. All in all, I will definitely repeat-purchase this.</li>
            <li> Product is very gritty.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use on her incision sites on her knee, she had surgery about 4 weeks ago. She will be using this and a little vitamin E to help reduce the appearance of the scar.</li>
            <li> In summary, Native Soul shea butter is high quality shea nut butter, and it is great for aged/dried skin.  My wife has been using this for  a few months and she really likes how much more rejuvenated the skin on her legs and arms has become since using this product.  A few times a week, after each shower she applies the shea butter and she has been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product by far. You can tell this is high quality shea butter. I did not use, but purchased it for a family member.</li>
            <li> Awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Beside been completely natural is very effective to the point immediately you can feel the difference i&#x27;m so hook on this product my skin is very dry to the point of cracking and since I started using this product a couple of days ago I can see the difference also I was always itchy because of the dryness and this stop as well highly recommend this product so happy I take the risk. thank you so much</li>
            <li> I use this stuff after I get out of the shower. My legs are always dry, but this stuff works very quickly to change that. I also love how there&#x27;s no scent (or none that I can detect). I can use it on my face or hair (a little will go a very long way) without issues. I will continue to by from Native Soul Body Care for this product.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Shea Butter. I have been using it over a week now and my skin feels so much softer. It has made a big difference with my hands. They are so dry that the skins splits open. This Shea butter is helping with that issue.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the other Shea Butters available. They have all been grainy and smelly.&lt;br /&gt;  I can not believe how smooth and pleasant smelling Raw Ivory Shea Butter by Native Soul Body Care is! This while remaining 100% Pure &amp; Unrefined with no additives and preservatives, which is very important to my family. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;  Many of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; shea butter products come packed in a plastic bag or cheap container, this product is packaged in a nice resealable container to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;  It is quickly absorbed and my skin is much softer by using it. This pure shea nut butter is a great value, large size (1 lb) and best of all....it works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I just received it yesterday and it will definitely last a long while.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  This Shea Butter leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I applied it immediately after a bath and my skin feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, you can immediately tell the difference after you&#x27;ve applied the shea butter to your skin and it leaves it feeling refreshed and moisturized. Applying it daily will greatly improve the quality of your skin, and I highly recommend this native soul shea butter!</li>
            <li> This pure shea butter has a pleasant natural scent and a texture that is neither hard nor gooey - almost fluffy before it warms and softens in my hands. It starts to soothe the eczema on my feet almost immediately, and it does not irritate my hypersensitive skin. It would make a good carrier for essential oils if it were gently heated and blended with other ingredients. As nice as it smells, it&#x27;s external use only, so don&#x27;t plan on eating it!</li>
