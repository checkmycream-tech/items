            <li>The smell is good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the grits and it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>, not as good as it was before.  </li>
            <li>the item arrived in good time, but it looks like it was melted and reconstituted or something.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as good...</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It holds well, smells nice and has a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Kevin Murphy products and the price was too good to pass up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great pliable hold and it makes my borderline frizzy, clean hair have a great texture even right after washing it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>:) I feel like an artist.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But basically your are putting magical dirt in your hair and the end result couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>it would still smell BETTER than what they have going on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Instead of the perfect gritty putty I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>Im a hairstylist for film and television, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>THEN I WILL KNOW FOR SURE</li>
            <li>I love this product because I don&#x27;t want my hair to be shiny (that look is so dated).</li>
            <li>I love everything Kevin Murphy makes.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it cheaper than what it costs at the salon.</li>
            <li>Flexible, yet strong.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair which can become frizzy very quickly...</li>
            <li>Medium strong hold, pliable/flexable, matte finish, smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of palmade but not as greasy, much drier.  </li>
            <li>Product just works great for short hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good holding wax for styling but for all the young guys, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>That original order was fine.</li>
            <li>I just switched from gels and this stuff works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and the hold is great.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>One of the ingredients is a special clay called Bentonite.</li>
            <li>it is gritty, smelled good and holds my hair well.</li>
            <li>Good for short hair like mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products and this one does the best for short or long hair.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy another one from my hairstylist since I liked what I initially purchased.</li>
            <li>There is no artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>your money and buy the Knight Rider product (which smells much better and has a better hold with less &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; of a finish)</li>
            <li>More importantly though, the texture of the new formula junk is a little bit more pliable feeling.</li>
            <li>USE IT EVERY DAY ON MY SHORT SHORT HAIR--MAKES GREAT TEXTURE AND DOESN&#x27;T FLATTEN IT OUT</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY SMOOTH WITH NO GRITTY TEXTURE</li>
            <li>I think the new formula is not as fragrant as the old, which although it smelled great was definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>And to my surprise, it is identical to my first purchase...</li>
            <li>the color is more brown and has a lot of gritty sandy like stuff in it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes flat after a few hours, the original formula was great.....</li>
            <li>I AM FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY MORE AND MORE ON AMAZON THAT THIS IS BECOMING A BIG PROBLEM.</li>
            <li>The old stuff felt more waxy, this stuff feels a little bit more workable which I like.</li>
            <li>but with just a little Gritty Business my hair stays controlled and looking wavy and natural and great!</li>
            <li>Gritty Business is my favourite as it is a perfect texture and takes such a little amount to do the job (OK, I have short hair).</li>
            <li>You can use it wet or dry &amp; it&#x27;s great for midday pickup too.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very dulling.</li>
            <li>Ready for filming.</li>
            <li>So now I wonder, did Kevin Murphy really changed their formula?</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>this product from amazon is real or not, the bottom line is the product is way over priced.</li>
            <li>Really controls my course hair.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice messy look but his hair still looks touchable.</li>
            <li>The clay had a nice texture, and was exactly what I had purchased in the past from the hair salon.</li>
            <li>I normally get this product through my salon, so imagine my excitement when I saw it on Amazon for cheaper!  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this in July 2013 and only for $16!</li>
            <li>The former one was so much better, creating a massive texture without being fat at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so definitely worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li>This new grittyless formula just gets fat in the hair.</li>
            <li>I AM GOING TO THE SALON TOMARROW AND BUYING A NEW JAR.</li>
            <li>I went by the salon today and bought a new 3.7 oz jar of this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, very subtle and neither masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li>Rider by Kevin Murphy which is a very stiff hold, as my hair grew I needed something slightly more relaxed... but still textured.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the one I purchased through Amazon hardly contained any grits and consisted \\&quot;lard\\&quot; for the most part.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take much, so it should last me a while.</li>
            <li>, I received a clumpy old oxidized rock.</li>
            <li>THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid $40 dollars for the stuff from amazon and only paid  $27 dollars for the real stuff from the salon.</li>
            <li>I am going to contact the company directly and see if this product has been changed.</li>
            <li>It smells like an old man</li>
            <li>I just received my second order of this, and first of all I paid over $40 for it, and it is completely different to what I had before.</li>
            <li>find a local salon where you live that carries Kevin Murphy products and buy from them.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL SEEMS TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE OTHER JAR I HAD</li>
            <li>you mixed the smell from your grandmothers couch and old lady perfume</li>
            <li>The clay is a much lighter color, and very tough to scoop out the container, and does not apply to the hair easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obvious that this new one is a very different color (darker) and a very different texture (spongy).  </li>
            <li>I actually just tried the new formula today and have been using the older stuff for a few years.</li>
            <li>reason for four stars instead of five is that when the product arrived it had a little different texture than when I buy the exact same product from my salon.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;SO, highly recommend this product for styling short choppy hairstyles, but if it arrives looking a little dried out send it back and ask for a fresh one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they have changed the formula, if this one had been sitting around too long, or if this is some knock off, but regardless it is going back to amazon.</li>
            <li> Gritty and dirty may be its aim, and that&#x27;s surely how my hair feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> The product from amazon has a grey look to it.</li>
            <li> I think the reason is that the product received from Amazon was probably older and had dried out a little.  </li>
            <li> Pliable, not very shiny and if you have a long day just re-apply and it&#x27;s a 7 out of 10.</li>
            <li> when i compare what&#x27;s in this container to what is left of my previous container</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot of product at least a month worth if not more.</li>
            <li> I get lasting hold all day with little need to go in and retouch the style.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> THE TEXTURE WAS MUCH HARDER THAN WHAT I HAVE RECIEVED FROM THE SALON.</li>
            <li> It still worked but occasionally left some visible product in my hair since as I mentioned it was somewhat dried out.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not even close..smells like cheap deodorant! :(</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but something is not right  with this product.</li>
            <li> BUT STILL NOT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s like every other heavy greasy product..</li>
            <li> Flexible hold, not super greasy.</li>
            <li> Clay wax is a little pricey</li>
            <li> TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> It has a waxy type feel to it and is very thick.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll probably buy it - and it&#x27;ll arrive and it&#x27;ll smell WAY worse than you ever imagined a hair product</li>
            <li> Expensive but lasts 6 months</li>
            <li> Silly Amazon reviewers....</li>
            <li> THINKING THIS IS FAKE.</li>
            <li> AND I THINK THIS IS A FAKE.</li>
            <li> THIS IS FAKE.</li>
            <li> I wish this weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I like it!</li>
            <li> sooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to read the reviews about how this stuff has the worst smell - and you&#x27;ll think.</li>
            <li> Simply terrible.</li>

            <li> Best product ever... Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Pliable, not very shiny and if you have a long day just re-apply and it&#x27;s a 7 out of 10.</li>
            <li> This new grittyless formula just gets fat in the hair. Would not recommend it anymore. The former one was so much better, creating a massive texture without being fat at all. Hopefully they will start making the former one again soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products and this one does the best for short or long hair.  The product holds your hair and is still pliable at the end of the day.  The smell is good.  It has a waxy type feel to it and is very thick.  You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this makes my hair feel. Gritty and dirty may be its aim, and that&#x27;s surely how my hair feels when I use it. It&#x27;s also very dulling.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I expected. I save a lot of money from the salon costs. I will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Great solution for those who don&#x27;t like hair gel. Flexible hold, not super greasy.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, but it still has the same hold. I get lots of compliments on my hair - it holds and adds lots of texture without looking greasy or overdone.</li>
            <li> sooo disappointed. There was nothing like gritty business.. it&#x27;s not at all gritty anymore, and thats what made it work so well for my short hair... now it&#x27;s like every other heavy greasy product.. i miss the smell too...not even close..smells like cheap deodorant! :(</li>
            <li> My hair looks like hollywood now :) I feel like an artist. Ready for filming. one two three four words.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having purchased one from my hairstylist. I loved the grits and it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. I was very excited to find it cheaper than what it costs at the salon. However, it all changed when I received my order. For some reason, the one I purchased through Amazon hardly contained any grits and consisted \\&quot;lard\\&quot; for the most part. So disappointing! I decided to buy another one from my hairstylist since I liked what I initially purchased. And to my surprise, it is identical to my first purchase...it is gritty, smelled good and holds my hair well. So now I wonder, did Kevin Murphy really changed their formula? Or was I sold a counterfeit???</li>
            <li> This is great pliable hold and it makes my borderline frizzy, clean hair have a great texture even right after washing it.</li>
            <li> The formula has changed., not as good as it was before.  Hair becomes flat after a few hours, the original formula was great.....not buying again...</li>
            <li> This is the best product for curly hair . There is no artificial chemicals. I love it</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! USE IT EVERY DAY ON MY SHORT SHORT HAIR--MAKES GREAT TEXTURE AND DOESN&#x27;T FLATTEN IT OUT</li>
            <li> Medium strong hold, pliable/flexable, matte finish, smooth to touch. If you have shorter hair (&lt; 3\\&quot;) I highly recommend this product. One of the ingredients is a special clay called Bentonite. It is used in hundreds of applications from treating digestive issues to maintaining stability of open cuts into the earth. But basically your are putting magical dirt in your hair and the end result couldn&#x27;t be better. Apply as the directions indicate, into damp hair and style as desired. It will hold up fantastically all day even if you are a hat wearer. The smell is unobtrusive and in no way conspicuous.</li>
            <li> Expensive but lasts 6 months so definitely worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It holds well, smells nice and has a nice matte finish. It also doesn&#x27;t take much, so it should last me a while.</li>
            <li> the item arrived in good time, but it looks like it was melted and reconstituted or something.  when i compare what&#x27;s in this container to what is left of my previous container it&#x27;s obvious that this new one is a very different color (darker) and a very different texture (spongy).  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but something is not right  with this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to read the reviews about how this stuff has the worst smell - and you&#x27;ll think. Silly Amazon reviewers....what do you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you&#x27;ll probably buy it - and it&#x27;ll arrive and it&#x27;ll smell WAY worse than you ever imagined a hair product could smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you mixed the smell from your grandmothers couch and old lady perfume it would still smell BETTER than what they have going on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy the Knight Rider product (which smells much better and has a better hold with less &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; of a finish)</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who has curly hair he loves it. Creates a nice messy look but his hair still looks touchable. Same stuff justin timberlake uses!</li>
            <li> I really like the product, I buy it all the time at the salon. When I saw I could get it for $6 off on amazon, I ordered one. Instead of the perfect gritty putty I&#x27;m used to, I received a clumpy old oxidized rock. I decided to give it a try, hoping it would come back to life. The heat from my hands did almost nothing to the consistency. It left white specs in my hair. It didn&#x27;t have that gritty hold. Simply terrible. I&#x27;ll suck up the $16 loss and buy a box at the salon. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Im a hairstylist for film and television, I LOVE this product. Just a little bit goes a long way. I style the hair as required then layer in Gritty Business, then reshape the style. I get lasting hold all day with little need to go in and retouch the style. I also use it myself!</li>
            <li> I wish this weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I like it!</li>
            <li> Best wax on the market.</li>
            <li> they changed the formula here and it&#x27;s not as good...</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this stuff for my husband.  It gives hair texture without stiffness.  It kind of reminds me of palmade but not as greasy, much drier.  The scent is pleasant, very subtle and neither masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS THINKING THIS IS FAKE. I DID WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DID.TRIED TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS ON AMAZON. THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY SMOOTH WITH NO GRITTY TEXTURE WHAT SO EVER. THE COLOR WAS DIFFERENT AND THE TEXTURE WAS MUCH HARDER THAN WHAT I HAVE RECIEVED FROM THE SALON. MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD THEY GET RID OF THE GRIT IN A PRODUCT CALLED GRITTY BUSINESS? SOMETHING DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS A FAKE. THE SMELL SEEMS TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE OTHER JAR I HAD BUT STILL NOT RIGHT. I AM GOING TO THE SALON TOMARROW AND BUYING A NEW JAR. IF IT  IS GRITTY THEN I WILL KNOW FOR SURE THIS IS FAKE. I AM FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY MORE AND MORE ON AMAZON THAT THIS IS BECOMING A BIG PROBLEM. I MAY HAVE TO DROP MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND JUST GO BACK TO BUYING MY STUFF THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ok. I went by the salon today and bought a new 3.7 oz jar of this product. It is without a doubt different. the color is more brown and has a lot of gritty sandy like stuff in it. I also noticed the jar is 3.7 oz vs 3.4 on the jar from amazon. The product from amazon has a grey look to it. The biggest thing I noticed besides the color and grit is the price. I paid $40 dollars for the stuff from amazon and only paid  $27 dollars for the real stuff from the salon. I am going to contact the company directly and see if this product has been changed. The stylist at the salon said she did not hear of a product change and everything they have in the salon is the gritty/sandy stuff. My final thought on this issue is weather this product from amazon is real or not, the bottom line is the product is way over priced. find a local salon where you live that carries Kevin Murphy products and buy from them. I am going to try to return this product. Hopefully!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product because I don&#x27;t want my hair to be shiny (that look is so dated). I want my hair to look thicker with a matte finish. Clay wax is a little pricey but it&#x27;s a lot of product at least a month worth if not more. Really controls my course hair. I am happy...</li>
            <li> Love it! I appreciate the quality of the Kevin Murphy line of products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell....I never used it or touched the product...I tried to return it and got NO WHERE!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of people know about it, get it before it becomes mainstream!</li>
            <li> great product.  doesn&#x27;t get to funky.  I dig it.  can sleep in it for a day or 2 no problem</li>
            <li> I actually just tried the new formula today and have been using the older stuff for a few years. I am going to disagree with the others who dislike the change. I think the new formula is not as fragrant as the old, which although it smelled great was definitely noticeable. More importantly though, the texture of the new formula junk is a little bit more pliable feeling. The old stuff felt more waxy, this stuff feels a little bit more workable which I like. Holler!</li>
            <li> I normally get this product through my salon, so imagine my excitement when I saw it on Amazon for cheaper!  I LOVE Kevin Murphy products and the price was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for four stars instead of five is that when the product arrived it had a little different texture than when I buy the exact same product from my salon.  I think the reason is that the product received from Amazon was probably older and had dried out a little.  It still worked but occasionally left some visible product in my hair since as I mentioned it was somewhat dried out.  I should have returned it and asked for a replacement but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, highly recommend this product for styling short choppy hairstyles, but if it arrives looking a little dried out send it back and ask for a fresh one.  Would be five stars if it had arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good holding wax for styling but for all the young guys, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It smells like an old man</li>
            <li> Holds my hair without it being sticky. I just switched from gels and this stuff works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this in July 2013 and only for $16! That original order was fine. The clay had a nice texture, and was exactly what I had purchased in the past from the hair salon. I just received my second order of this, and first of all I paid over $40 for it, and it is completely different to what I had before. The clay is a much lighter color, and very tough to scoop out the container, and does not apply to the hair easily. I don&#x27;t know if they have changed the formula, if this one had been sitting around too long, or if this is some knock off, but regardless it is going back to amazon. I&#x27;m going to try and find this elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Product just works great for short hair.  You can use it wet or dry &amp; it&#x27;s great for midday pickup too.</li>
            <li> Good for short hair like mine</li>
            <li> I love everything Kevin Murphy makes. This one is god for sweeping my bang back. Excellent hold. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It lasts all day long and the hold is great.</li>
            <li> I was using Night.Rider by Kevin Murphy which is a very stiff hold, as my hair grew I needed something slightly more relaxed... but still textured. Exactly what I needed. Medium control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kevin.Murphy for years.  Gritty Business is my favourite as it is a perfect texture and takes such a little amount to do the job (OK, I have short hair).</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It holds my hair in place all day and I can adjust my hair even at the end of the day. It provides lots of pliability and strength. Flexible, yet strong.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. I have fine hair which can become frizzy very quickly...but with just a little Gritty Business my hair stays controlled and looking wavy and natural and great! I really love it.</li>
