            <li>The black color is great because it goes with whatever color salon you have.</li>
            <li>These towels at first were slightly rough, but within the 1st wash they felt great.</li>
            <li>I just have to remember when I get ready to wash this micro fiber towel that I’ll need to wash alone, since the towel is so absorbent it will easily also pick up any cotton material in comes in to contract with.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of water the towel was able to hold.  </li>
            <li>My clients love that they are soft, and trust me...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to soak up a lot of water and it hair faster than my traditional towels.</li>

            <li>Absorbs a lot and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>they are amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>The drying time was a quick as the website said, it dried much faster than my cotton towel normally would.</li>
            <li>These towels were a bargain and they work well so far.  </li>
            <li>Color does not fade and they are so soft for the customer.</li>

            <li>I use these every day as a stylist (which means that they get washed frequently) and they are still like new 8 months later.</li>
            <li>I ordered these about 8 months ago for my new salon suite and wanted to wait until I used these for awhile before I left a review</li>

            <li> My clients love these towels!  It&#x27;s all we use in my salon.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST towels I have ever used in the salon.  I have been a stylist for 22+ years and have never used a towel like this before. They towel dry the hair very well without leaving really wet areas.  When just using a standard towel you always have spots that stay wet and you have to re-towel dry it. With the comfy microfiber towels you don&#x27;t have to redry the hair.  When blotting a  perm you don&#x27;t feel like you have all towel you can get inbetween the rods and really blot each rod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the end of the day and you have a bin full of towels and capes its not heaping over as the towels are thinner than a regular towel.  I just love these towels and will not purchase any other for my salon ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Paula, Wisconsin</li>
            <li> Good towels, have a lot of dye running out. So wash before use</li>
            <li> First of all I love how soft these towels are my clients love these towels too!  I&#x27;ve had them over a month and ave washed them in hot water everytime &amp; still look new! Nothing stains these towels!  Definitely have told my friends in the industry to purchase these towels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you fabulous product &amp; price!!!</li>
            <li> The towels are great. Absorbs a lot and dry quickly. The only hing is that some are a little frayed. Not sure how that happened. But good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these towels. Not only am I think about using these for hair, but also my car. I&#x27;m able to soak up a lot of water and it hair faster than my traditional towels. I&#x27;ve used similar towels to wash cars and it has a similar effect, but for your hair. The black color is great because it goes with whatever color salon you have. I only had one concern with the towel when it arrived... There was a fabric loop at the end that was detached from the time I got it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was supposed to be attached so you can hang the towel? But overall this is a great towel.</li>
            <li> These towels are great! I use them in my salon and they absorb water well when towel drying hair. The client like them because they are extremely soft, lightweight, and longer than other towels I&#x27;ve used in the past. Shipping was fast. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Great Quality.</li>

            <li> REALLY BAD , POOR QUALITY AND NO BLEACH SAFE , COLOR CHANGE AFTER 2 WEEKS</li>
            <li> I liked the towels ,they are strong and soft.They don&#x27;t get discolored  even after using them with color lightener. However they are a little bit on the thin side.</li>
            <li> These towels feel great.  They also hold up well with washing and drying.  The towels did not shrink or fade.</li>
            <li> These towels at first were slightly rough, but within the 1st wash they felt great. Very plush, seem to be durable and passed my bleach test, and they are the best price you will find</li>
