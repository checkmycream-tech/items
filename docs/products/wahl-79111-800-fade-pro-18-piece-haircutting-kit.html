            <li>Good Wahl clipper, very nice</li>
            <li>good clippers, good price.</li>
            <li>Had one for 20 years and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Great for doing my own hair.</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>well actually I liked a lot, plus I have shown more people and likes too,</li>
            <li>Glad I choose that one.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t think of anything more I&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li>Respectfully Mrs. M.T.S</li>
            <li>I definitely have the best wife prize for getting this for him!</li>
            <li>I got these clippers for him for Christmas and they&#x27;ve been a HUGE hit.  </li>
            <li>It literally takes him 1/3 of the time it used to and they&#x27;re so precise and easy to manage and clean.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>The motor is very strong and cuts my hair very.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this for hubby for Valentines......</li>
            <li>That sucker is great!</li>
            <li>You know, a PROfessional fade that transitions nicely.</li>
            <li>Cool Care spray is recommended.</li>
            <li>this really amazed me cuts smooth no pull and gives u ah great fade pattern with barely any effort and the prices is exactly what your looking for</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the magic clippers, which are only 10 dollars more on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A heavy duty shaver and hair cutter at an affordable price that functions beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, right down to the power drive motor (which rivals the 5000 in my five star).</li>
            <li>Comes with some basic cleaning/maintenance supplies which is nice.</li>
            <li>It makes for a great personal use tool too, but may not stand up to commercial use.</li>
            <li>powerful motor, sharp blades, wide taper, comfortable grips, ideal for high definition</li>
            <li>Just make sure your friend is awake enough to pay attention!</li>
            <li>I am a former infantry soldier, I learned to cut my own hair shortly after I joined, and I have been using cheap Conair clippers before these</li>
            <li>(which I did the first time I used it, ouch).</li>
            <li>I first started fading with Andis headliners.</li>
            <li>Since it is new, it cuts so much better than the old one, and doesn&#x27;t hang up at all.  </li>
            <li>I would just get a whole new set instead of a pack of new guards, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Not the best:( I can&#x27;t get a clean fade and tugs on the hair!</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t last as long as a good proffesional cut, but hey you can do it at home.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage clippers.when</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>for this reason is that I like thanks</li>
            <li>This Wahl cuts hair very evenly and does not pull your hair.</li>
            <li>These wear out really fast.</li>
            <li>Too much noise .awful</li>
            <li>This is really a very efficient model clipper.  </li>
            <li>It looks pretty but caught hubby using old beat up ones.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but so far they work just fine.</li>
            <li>and they usually only lasted about 8 months before they burned up, although I just recently got these clippers, I can already tell they are better made</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, came quickly to</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Useful but will not last forever</li>
            <li>I made this choice after my last clippers from Conair burned up after only the third use and I am glad I did, these clippers do not pull or get hot,</li>
            <li>I figured for a few dollars more</li>
            <li>The clippers work as expected, I have no complaints besides the fact that they get hot after about 40 mins of use, uncomfortably hot.  </li>
            <li>I first opened the box it seemed like the clippers had already been used because there was a really big scratch through the gold of the clippers which made the clippers look really beat and worn out and on top of that these clippers miss alot of hair and get hot after 15 minutes of cutting so dont waste your money on all these cheap walmart clippers it will save you (so much) time And money just to buy high quality professionals clippers 40$ and up range</li>
            <li>Design and feel are professional.</li>
            <li>These are going straight back.</li>
            <li>How can you call yourself a Fade Pro if you are missing the all important #2 clipper guard that&#x27;s used to fade from 1/2 to 1 to 2?</li>
            <li>Although the cutting was extremely precise and the motor had good power, I couldn&#x27;t do much with them outside of extremely short fades due to the fact that they have no taper.</li>
            <li>In general, it works pretty well but the 1/4&amp;#34; comb attachment is loose and rattles while operating.</li>
            <li>My husband (african american) cuts his own hair and the clippers he used to have were old and while they still worked, they over heated quickly and made his time cutting his hair protracted.  </li>
            <li>A little heavy for someone who has never cut hair before, other then that a great product.</li>
            <li>I was limited in how much definition I could add to my styles.</li>
            <li>They are the least expensive thus far, and could possibly be the best as well.</li>
            <li>Upgrading to Wahl professional guards sold individually is a must.</li>
            <li>This in my third hair clippers  in 31 years and each on is a little better than the previous.</li>
            <li>, I was concerned about them overheating as a few reviews stated because since I cut my hair myself it generally takes a little longer than cutting someone else&#x27;s hair in order to ensure that you keep your hairline even, but even still I did not have any issues with them overheating, they were just starting to get warm when I was finishing, but they were nowhere near hot.</li>

            <li> The blade itself adjusts from a zero overlap to a wide open taper, giving you several different length options even before you use your guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts uneven and bare bladed WILL pull on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used them to cut my sons hair, and since he is only a year and a half</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but they weren&#x27;t for African-American hair,especially in West coast Canada.</li>
            <li> Other than that they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t checked the other combs</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad: guards provided are cheap and will rattle.</li>
            <li> No #2. Had to shave most of my hair off because I looked like a moron with a bowl/mushroom haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been into the beauty hobby for a little while now</li>
            <li> When I asked, he said this one is too heavy to deal with.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it arrived in a timely manner, upon opening two of the guards were already broken, both had snapped during shipping or before they left the factory.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this is the blades with out the guards on are very sharp and can cut bad if you are not careful</li>
            <li> Opened up what appeared to be a sealed container and and the clippers had small scratches, a black smudge and hair all over the blade.</li>
            <li> in fact, the go though my hair faster and feel smoother than any clippers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I had another Wahl set for about 12 years and it still works, but the guards did not go small enough for how I am currently cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not one of my favorites. :(</li>
            <li> But very disappointed when he told me it pulled his hairs as he was using it.  </li>
            <li> They were awful.</li>

            <li> It works great. Glad I choose that one.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage clippers.when I first opened the box it seemed like the clippers had already been used because there was a really big scratch through the gold of the clippers which made the clippers look really beat and worn out and on top of that these clippers miss alot of hair and get hot after 15 minutes of cutting so dont waste your money on all these cheap walmart clippers it will save you (so much) time And money just to buy high quality professionals clippers 40$ and up range</li>
            <li> Good Wahl clipper, very nice and I think well made. Work great.  Mrs. Larghe</li>
            <li> Useful but will not last forever</li>
            <li> Save on haircuts if you got a friend to do your hair. Maybe it won&#x27;t last as long as a good proffesional cut, but hey you can do it at home. Like whenever you feel like it, no appointment, no need to stick to only when they are open. Just make sure your friend is awake enough to pay attention!</li>
            <li> Not the best:( I can&#x27;t get a clean fade and tugs on the hair! Not one of my favorites. :(</li>
            <li> good clippers, good price.</li>
            <li> this really amazed me cuts smooth no pull and gives u ah great fade pattern with barely any effort and the prices is exactly what your looking for</li>
            <li> Great product. High quality. Comes with plenty of accessories. Design and feel are professional. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Comes with some basic cleaning/maintenance supplies which is nice.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. The motor is very strong and cuts my hair very. Especially since I like to bald myself. This was a terrific buy for me.</li>
            <li> The clippers work as expected, I have no complaints besides the fact that they get hot after about 40 mins of use, uncomfortably hot.  I keep them oiled well, so hopefully no damage occurs, but I worry about the hear warping the guards, hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen.  Only time will tell, but so far they work just fine.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty but caught hubby using old beat up ones. When I asked, he said this one is too heavy to deal with. Oh well. I tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it arrived in a timely manner, upon opening two of the guards were already broken, both had snapped during shipping or before they left the factory.  Leaving me without a number 8 or 6 guard.  Seems like the plastic welds are a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> That sucker is great! Had one for 20 years and this one is just as good. I tried other brands but they weren&#x27;t for African-American hair,especially in West coast Canada. I love it.</li>
            <li> These just arrived today and THEY ARE USED!!! Opened up what appeared to be a sealed container and and the clippers had small scratches, a black smudge and hair all over the blade. These are going straight back.</li>
            <li> How can you call yourself a Fade Pro if you are missing the all important #2 clipper guard that&#x27;s used to fade from 1/2 to 1 to 2? You know, a PROfessional fade that transitions nicely. Not here. No #2. Had to shave most of my hair off because I looked like a moron with a bowl/mushroom haircut. Thanks Wahl. Just bought the #2 clipper guard separately. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! I used them to cut my sons hair, and since he is only a year and a half i wanted something that was sturdy, quiet, and had all of the guards included so they worked out perfectly. They work really good, great purchase!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. Great for doing my own hair. Sharp and easy to use. Lots of attachments. Can&#x27;t think of anything more I&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li> well actually I liked a lot, plus I have shown more people and likes too, for this reason is that I like thanks</li>
            <li> This Wahl cuts hair very evenly and does not pull your hair. The kit comes with 18 piece kit and I only used three of them.</li>
            <li> A heavy duty shaver and hair cutter at an affordable price that functions beautifully.  Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> These wear out really fast. Other than that they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> In general, it works pretty well but the 1/4&amp;#34; comb attachment is loose and rattles while operating. Haven&#x27;t checked the other combs but I imagine some will have the same issue.  Otherwise, unit seems to function well.</li>
            <li> I am a former infantry soldier, I learned to cut my own hair shortly after I joined, and I have been using cheap Conair clippers before these and they usually only lasted about 8 months before they burned up, although I just recently got these clippers, I can already tell they are better made, I was concerned about them overheating as a few reviews stated because since I cut my hair myself it generally takes a little longer than cutting someone else&#x27;s hair in order to ensure that you keep your hairline even, but even still I did not have any issues with them overheating, they were just starting to get warm when I was finishing, but they were nowhere near hot.

            <li> you get what you pay for,  this is by no means a deal. It cuts uneven and bare bladed WILL pull on your skin.</li>
            <li> This in my third hair clippers  in 31 years and each on is a little better than the previous.Thay are great, thats why I choose to use this brand.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this for hubby for Valentines...... But very disappointed when he told me it pulled his hairs as he was using it.  Wahl is excellent brand, so will try another one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, came quickly to</li>
            <li> A little heavy for someone who has never cut hair before, other then that a great product. Respectfully Mrs. M.T.S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been into the beauty hobby for a little while now and this is the third set of fading clippers I&#x27;ve purchased. They are the least expensive thus far, and could possibly be the best as well. I first started fading with Andis headliners. They were awful. My next purchase was a balding clipper from the wall five star line. Although the cutting was extremely precise and the motor had good power, I couldn&#x27;t do much with them outside of extremely short fades due to the fact that they have no taper. Purchasing additional guides did help alot, but Without an adjustment on the blade itself I was limited in how much definition I could add to my styles. So, like the headliners, they got shelved. Then I found the fade pro. This is a great product, right down to the power drive motor (which rivals the 5000 in my five star). The blade itself adjusts from a zero overlap to a wide open taper, giving you several different length options even before you use your guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: powerful motor, sharp blades, wide taper, comfortable grips, ideal for high definition fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: guards provided are cheap and will rattle. Upgrading to Wahl professional guards sold individually is a must. Clipper overheats. Cool Care spray is recommended. Not as powerful as the magic clippers, which are only 10 dollars more on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: this is a must have product for a beauty beginner. It makes for a great personal use tool too, but may not stand up to commercial use.</li>
            <li> Too much noise .awful</li>
            <li> This is really a very efficient model clipper.  My husband (african american) cuts his own hair and the clippers he used to have were old and while they still worked, they over heated quickly and made his time cutting his hair protracted.  I got these clippers for him for Christmas and they&#x27;ve been a HUGE hit.  It literally takes him 1/3 of the time it used to and they&#x27;re so precise and easy to manage and clean.  I definitely have the best wife prize for getting this for him!</li>
