    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product from Reach.  </li>
            <li>The best way to floss is to sort of pull the floss to the side, making a C-shape with the floss, to get the floss to scrape the side of the tooth.  </li>
            <li>Not the best thing if you just want to floss and go to bed</li>
            <li>This floss is excellent.</li>
            <li>The best dental floss I have used .</li>
            <li>Perfect flossing care.</li>
            <li>My Dental Hygenist said she felt it was the best for my teeth since they are close together.</li>

            <li>This was an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>best denal floss  </li>
            <li>best price</li>
            <li>Best floss on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson is a very good company</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred and cleans our teeth beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t experienced any floss breakage while flossing.  </li>
            <li>I think this floss does a great job of removing plaque between your teeth, but I don&#x27;t believe it holds up to its claim of removing stains.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a great floss, in that it didn&#x27;t fray when I was using it</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, great floss but don&#x27;t expect to cure cancer with it, unless of course you are Macgyver.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so great at keeping it ON the floss as you remove it from in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I think this product is very effective at removing plaque and objects you might have between your teeth.    </li>
            <li>Good product, bought the 6 pack as it was a really great deal.  </li>
            <li>That was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very easy floss to use!  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dentist with good reason.</li>
            <li>It feels like it does a good job removing plaque from between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It glides between the tightest places and does a superior job.  </li>
            <li>Good dental hygiene itself will provide good breath, attractive teeth and healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was shipped in record speed and our family is very very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>So glad you carry it that I ordered a pack of 6!</li>
            <li>I love this floss!</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite products!  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought the set of six!</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t bother you to have your junk fling and fly off the floss, it IS an easy dental floss to use in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I welcome the elasticity of this floss, allowing easy access to interdental spaces.</li>
            <li>best floss - if you don&#x27;t have large spaces between your teeth (or even if you do)</li>
            <li>you want to get into the habit of flossing - and we all should - then it&#x27;s important that you find a product that you are happy with.  </li>
            <li>Kind of elastic.</li>
            <li>Has a good mint taste to make flossing a bit more tolerable...highly recommended..</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with that information and now purchase this product in multipacks.</li>
            <li>Truly effective...</li>
            <li>I really liked this floss.  </li>
            <li>This new floss by REACH has a splendid mint smell and the great taste of it never leaves the floss.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use  superior technology.</li>
            <li>Very easy to hold onto.  </li>
            <li>Its very strong and non waxy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most amazing thing.  </li>
            <li>this is the best dental floss as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Good clean feeling, no pain.</li>
            <li>The mint taste (quite distinct) makes it more pleasant to use than most.  </li>
            <li>I love this floss.</li>
            <li>I went from flossing once a month to flossing sometimes more than once per day.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure a lot of this does go to the credit of the baking soda.  </li>
            <li>People need to learn how to floss and brush correctly and make sure they brush twice a day and floss once a day.  </li>
            <li>My favorite floss.</li>
            <li>Reach floss, like the Reach toothbrush, is just a bit better than its competition.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, this floss actually does help to whiten teeth in the corners and in-between where whitening kits and pastes just don&#x27;t do as well.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like dental tape rather than dental floss.     </li>
            <li>and I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Mint Floss, 100yards, for many years.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>great product, works well and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This was one of the most interesting dental flosses I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>How can it not remove more?  </li>
            <li>but feel better about it with the added ease that product gives.</li>
            <li>Maybe by the end of the roll, I&#x27;ll be able to tell but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening effect, I&#x27;m sure it does help to whiten the edges of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and maybe it feels a bit more plastic than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better, and I hope Reach keeps it.</li>
            <li>it surely doesn&#x27;t seem like it even cleans your teeth at all.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and my hygienist was able to remove most of the staining, but not that in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this brand and find it to be better than most others.</li>
            <li>better than the glide stuff that you can&#x27;t even keep on your finger.</li>
            <li>will buy more of this soon.</li>
            <li>Reach total care is the best floss</li>
            <li>My only drawback was that I didn&#x27;t see a great impact in terms of whitening - particularly at the gumline where you would expect this floss to have the greatest impact on stains for coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I experienced some sticker shock over the price, being the kind of person who will grab a calculator and seeing how much she&#x27;s paying by the yard, but I guess pricey floss is worth it if it keeps you flossing.  </li>
            <li>I like to try new dental products, and was happy to give this one</li>
            <li>Great new product.</li>
            <li>The things is is that it is very hyped up in the description like it&#x27;s some kind of miracle floss, a floss with technological advantages and amazing benefits that no floss has even attempted to do before.  </li>
            <li>Some dental flosses have a strong aftertaste, in my opinion, but this Reach floss adds just a hint of mint without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Choose a brand of floss that is easy and enjoyable to use and USE IT FAITHFULLY.  </li>
            <li>Choose a brand of floss that is easy and enjoyable to use and USE IT FAITHFULLY.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it so easily at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also this is a great value with a pack of 6, which totals nearly the size of 2 football fields(180 yards,)</li>
            <li>What I do like about Reach is the rubbery type material is more comfortable to use on my teeth</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve always preached, the prevention of cavities is more important than the appearance of one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve always preached, the prevention of cavities is more important than the appearance of one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and gets the areas between my teeth squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>This is probably the BEST dental floss because it would not break between my teeth, many other cheap ones would.  </li>
            <li>It easily gets between my teeth without getting stuck or caught.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever actually liked to floss...</li>
            <li>The best feature is that the floss stretches slightly, so if it does get stuck, you can easily jiggle it out without tearing it or ripping your teeth out.  </li>
            <li>This floss gets into those spaces just fine.  </li>
            <li>With that at free shipping it was an easy decision to make the switch</li>
            <li>Glad to order a half-dozen here that arrived quickly as promised.</li>
            <li>I find this floss makes the act of flossing more pleasant and easier and that is enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I initially actually LIKED how flexible it was - there is REALLY A LOT of give in this floss so that it&#x27;s really easy to manuever around your teeth in the nooks and crannies</li>
            <li>Best floss for those with tight contact between teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores here, so I got the brilliant idea of ordering it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>One HUGE thing that I DID like about it?</li>
            <li>It seems to do an excellent job when it holds together, but maybe my teeth are especially rough or some thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it would whiten my teeth on it&#x27;s own, but I do used a whitening toothpaste as well</li>
            <li>It has a light minty taste, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The smooth, rounded edges prevent scratching one&#x27;s legs when poking against material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get this floss in the 90 length packaging if it is available.  </li>
            <li>It is made of a rubbery elastic type material so it almost acts like a sling shot removing plaque and spraying it on the mirror, can be quite displeasing to those of us with sensitive stomachs, but I guess it is a good sign that it is removing the debris.</li>
            <li>Prefer this brand and type as it does not break easily, is not slippery on the fingers, and does an excellent job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>If the Total Care Floss makes flossing easier and more enjoyable, then maybe the consumer will be more prone to use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Joseph B. Hoyoser brands but does an excellent job of whitening my teeth and leaving them feeling slick when I pass my tongue over them.        </li>
            <li>If the Total Care Floss makes flossing easier and more enjoyable, then maybe the consumer will be more prone to use it.  </li>
            <li>but be sure to price this exact item at Wal-Mart before buying it on the Internet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a rather springy texture which may cause you to clean the mirror more often, since I had a higher ratio of stuff hitting the mirror</li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean unless I&#x27;ve flossed.  </li>
            <li>This is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Also, I find this to be very minty and enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve got a mouth full of goo but even for the teeny smidge of ickies</li>
            <li>Our hygienist says our teeth have been super clean since using it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the space between the teeth don&#x27;t whiten up enough with toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely THE BEST floss for people who have super tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted as a new customer on Amazon to easily find it and procure a large supply at a reasonable per-item price.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel fresh and clean after I floss</li>
            <li>Great product and priced reasonably when compared with my local retail stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no easy cure for good teeth care and healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that some other flosses may &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; stuff between your teeth better, however, making flossing easy for me is better than not flossing at all.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say for certain if it is actually removing any stains, but the texturing sure makes it feel like it&#x27;s giving a good scrubbing between the teeth.</li>
            <li>The tape is very textured, so easy to hold on to...</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s still a pretty good dental floss.</li>
            <li>I floss regularly but always investigate new floss products when they come on the market just to see if it gets the plaque off more effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have had trouble finding it and was so happy to discover it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I yanked, and then the whole roll broke free from its package and went flying.</li>
            <li>the fun begins.  </li>
            <li>I used the entire package before writing this review, and I really liked this floss.  </li>
            <li>Turns out that it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost, I never run out of Dental Floss and the Mint is my requirement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as whitening between the teeth I&#x27;ll have to work with it more time.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of these mint flosses but why can&#x27;t any of them get the packaging right?</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>No other floss cleans in between my teeth better than this one.</li>
            <li>some people reviewing this product obviously don&#x27;t have teeth like mine--so tightly jammed together that it is work to get any kind of floss between, and even more work to get it out again!</li>
            <li>I really like this floss and have used only this kind for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>, I now have enough packages of that great floss to last me for awhile.</li>
            <li>Also it would be very good for that awkward time after new dental work when you can&#x27;t get any kind of floss between the teeth.</li>
            <li>floss is wide, but smooth and very good for people with really tight gaps between teeth.</li>
            <li>But its possible this floss is too smooth and doesnt clean much(-1)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just the first part of the joke.  </li>
            <li>Pretty funny,</li>
            <li>I ended up nearly slicing off my head trying to get the floss to fit between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this floss, I truly do - but not necessarily for the reasons it is promoting itself.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a plastic ribbon than a traditional floss \\&quot;string\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Dental floss is essential in keeping one&#x27;s teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>White teeth are not always healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li>White teeth are not always healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li>Whether it was coincidence or not, I got a headache the first time I used this floss.</li>
            <li>If hearing your floss TWANG as it snaps off your tooth bothers you, then you better get some regular floss.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally, so my Hygenist contacted the Representative for this product and said that it could be purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I checked the exact number of this item against Wal-Mart after I bought it</li>
            <li>It was first introduced to me when I went in to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I believe it does remove more junk than standard wax floss.  </li>
            <li>I think this product will actually help me to floss more often, as I am not a fan of the act of flossing-</li>
            <li>There are various styles of floss out there to buy but this is our favorite.  </li>
            <li>first downside is the size per price.</li>
            <li>Most floss products are 50 yards, this was 30 at the same price as the others.</li>
            <li>I was able to restring it properly and get it working.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that my teeth are any whiter since I&#x27;ve started using the floss (about three weeks), but there is definitely a pleasant, fresh-and-clean aftertaste of baking soda on your teeth after using it.</li>
            <li>Plus this floss is wider; it&#x27;s not a string but more like a flat ribbon.</li>
            <li>This particular floss REACH TOTAL CARE does not shred and is quite the best for flossing, especially if a person has multiple flossing challenges (ie bridges, implants, etc...).  </li>
            <li>so I really strive to keep my teeth as healthy as possible to avoid those heart-pounding sessions in the dental chair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wondering if I was stuck with the stuff my gums didn&#x27;t love for life, I did a little homework and ended up buying a pack of \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss, which was pretty comfortable, though not quite as comfortable as the Reach Total Care.  </li>
            <li>strength of this dental floss is amazing, I think I could probably use it to tie down the trunk of my car if needed (I might try it &amp;lt;grin&gt;).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus it is a good performing floss like most Reach floss options, but not sure the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; works well enough to justify paying more for this than any other Reach floss with the microgroove technology.</li>
            <li>If the Reach Total Care Floss will entice one to floss more often, then I highly recommend purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the Reach Total Care Floss will entice one to floss more often, then I highly recommend purchasing it.      </li>
            <li>That elasticity that makes it easy to pull into the tight spaces makes a rubber-band strumming \\&quot;ping\\&quot; sound when you pull it out of the teeth...</li>
            <li>Overall, 4-stars...possibly 4.5 stars because I do like the floss material more than normal floss.</li>
            <li>This type of floss is similar to &#x27;glide&#x27; type floss that is easy to get in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>positive - I really like the mint flavor of this floss.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t shred easy so it can last you for your whole flossing job.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the new Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss, 30 yards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say, I would really have my doubts as to how much whitening a dental floss can really do to teeth, but that&#x27;s just an opinion and not a claim of fact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that are very close together.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think this is a benefit that Reach wants to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I didn&#x27;t floss much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t understand how using this product to floss would whiten the front of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Does it really whiten?</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t think the claim of whitening effect is really valid.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak much for the whitening factor.  </li>
            <li>This floss allows you to really get rid of the the food and plaque along your gumline and in between your teeth.     </li>
            <li>Also the floss is wider, flatter and very rubbery like rubber bands.  </li>
            <li>I can floss my teeth much faster.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t get used to this floss.</li>
            <li>Got it as a free sample from the dentist and was instantly hooked.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I really didn&#x27;t seem to be getting much plaque out from between my teeth, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reason that I gave the floss four stars is that I really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The Reach product has, on occasion, broke, but very infrequently so I still want to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I never liked to floss because I would always wrap it around my fingers because I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip.  </li>
            <li>This floss is good at getting in the grooves between teeth with minimal fraying or breakage - and my teeth as relatively close together.  </li>
            <li>My recent experience trying different flosses has gone kind of like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  </li>
            <li>I liked the former but not the latter.</li>
            <li>Other than that fact, I really like this floss and will probably purchase more when what I have is gone.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find locally, so was happy to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It was hard for me to understand why all these dental floss for sales in the States were made overseas and most are not good while those for sales in Canada, many of them are made in U.S.A. and are of better quality.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change as far as the whitening effect, but I already use a whitening rinse and a whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material is softer than classic floss and has an elastic-y consistency to it.</li>
            <li>The elasticity and strength of this floss is far more pleasing than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it more appealing, but it travels well inside a pocket, especially one pertaining to a tight pair of jeans.  </li>
            <li>This has worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this and the other floss I use.</li>
            <li>but the positive is that I end up cleaning the mirror and wall nearly every night.</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable to use than classic floss due to the elasticity of it and tastes just like any other mint floss.  </li>
            <li>and i find that even the idea that flossing will help with those tight tea stains does motivate me to floss more, so i call it a win-win situation, and order this in bulk.</li>
            <li>My teeth are tight and break most flosses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone whose teeth are close together.  </li>
            <li>(The mint flavoring is nice, too, but it&#x27;s not any different from other mint-flavored flosses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>It arrived fine, on time and is what we expected.</li>
            <li>The floss string is different than other kind that I&#x27;ve tried-this has a thicker string.</li>
            <li>The biggest plus for this floss as compared to other brands is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t easily break.  </li>
            <li>I also like the semi-transparent box, which lets me know exactly how much floss is left in the box.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t think I would switch to this one as my main dental floss, but it does deserve a place next to my sink as a secondary, since it would be perfect for the times I occasionally break off a bit of my regular floss between a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li>It slides between teeth easily and feels like is cleans a larger area than a finer floss, but is not as big as a dental tape.</li>
            <li>Great floss, but poor dispenser design mars the total product.  </li>
            <li>I had been using excellent CVS Advanced Fiber floss (terrible name), but it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Who knows if it actually whitens, because from my experience, it does not hug the side of your tooth unless you floss with another type of floss first.  </li>
            <li>The floss works well but no better than most name brand dental floss.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Reach Total Care Floss was the sleek design of its container.  </li>
            <li>Rembrandt is more expensive than the other brands but does an excellent job of whitening my teeth and leaving them feeling slick when I pass my tongue over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you are like me and you are already faithfully flossing your teeth while using a whitening toothpaste, the extra money spent on purchasing the Reach Total Care Floss will not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are like me and you are already faithfully flossing your teeth while using a whitening toothpaste, the extra money spent on purchasing the Reach Total Care Floss will not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it actually whitens but does leave a clean, fresh sensation after flossing.  </li>
            <li>It slips between the teeth really well, but it also has rough edges so that it picks up debris really well.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, there ARE varying types of dental floss - enough for me to take note.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf and they could not order it without my bringing in an old container.</li>
            <li>She was surprised, but said that she did use whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle of trying to get it between my teeth, so I will probably go back to the standard dental floss.</li>
            <li>The two stores that carry this product where I live have apparently discontinued selling it, so I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>you have teeth that are very tight and can&#x27;t get regular floss in between them, this would be better than not flossing at all.  </li>
            <li>I really do not see anything very special about this floss at all, besides that it is pink.      </li>
            <li>It really is like a piece of plastic ribbon, it&#x27;s flat.</li>
            <li>But there are other things that are worth considering in picking a dental floss besides shredding.</li>
            <li>(I hate it when it starts to break apart and unravel on the first tooth you use it on) and it tasted good (very minty).  </li>
            <li>I have some teeth that are very tight together and some with a comfortable space in between.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good as well-it doesn&#x27;t have a bad aftertaste or one that&#x27;s overly</li>
            <li>I had my teeth cleaned over six weeks ago and, despite the tremendous amount of coffee and tea that I drank, they are still white, even that crooked tooth in the middle of my bottom row that attracts stains like a magnet.  </li>
            <li>This seems better than my usual tiny threadlike floss...</li>
            <li>It really works, removes stuff between the teeth really well so that there is less plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>Really like this floss--it&#x27;s slightly stretchy and really traps the food.</li>
            <li>The thick strands slide easily between my teeth while making a loud popping noise.  </li>
            <li>normally use another floss by the same manufacturer that is non-whitening and have never had any</li>
            <li>I have used this floss for years but lately have not been able to find it in local retail stores.  </li>
            <li>, there is no other product like it at all.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my one major pet peeve with dental floss...</li>
            <li>This floss is like no other floss.  </li>
            <li>According to the Reach web site, the most popular floss brand (the least expensive and the one that I use) is the Reach Mint Waxed Floss; it cleans teeth and prevents plaque buildup just as well as the Reach Total Care Floss.  </li>
            <li>According to the Reach web site, the most popular floss brand (the least expensive and the one that I use) is the Reach Mint Waxed Floss; it cleans teeth and prevents plaque buildup just as well as the Reach Total Care Floss.  </li>
            <li>Those pre-threaded \\&quot;picks\\&quot; make it a little more convenient, but were even more uncomfortable as I really had to push down to get them between the teeth, resulting in a gum-thwacking \\&quot;snap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really disliked the way many of the other floss products I&#x27;d tried broke off during my flossing.  </li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>In fact, it hardly breaks and it fits inbetween tight contacts pretty easily.</li>
            <li>, is that it is loud when pulling back out from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Reach Mint Waxed Floss barely has a mint taste, let alone a smell.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive gums and this is the only floss I&#x27;ve found that hasn&#x27;t hurt to use.  </li>
            <li>This floss is wide, slips into place like Glide, but unlike Glide, has grooved surfaces that really scour teeth.</li>
            <li>I think, in a way, it works better than a thin string in getting anything in between your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Giving Reach Total Care a try, I noticed right away how comfortably the weird stretchy tape slipped between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s got &#x27;boing&#x27; to it, it wasn&#x27;t easy to KEEP the goo on the floss as I tried to bypass the icky used part to move onto the next part of the floss.  </li>
            <li>odd thing is, my dentist and I agree that my teeth are pretty closely spaced.  </li>
            <li>Either way, you&#x27;ll need to at least be able to get used to the elasticity of the floss long enough for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My main complaint, and reason for dropping a star, down to 4, is this stuff snags, then breaks fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It glides nicely without shredding or breaking apart as I do have a couple of teeth that are very close together and tight which makes getting some kinds of floss in and out difficult.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the couple of weeks that I have been using it, but this is like any other whitening toothpaste or similar product in that it more than likely only makes a very slight difference.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t really get the gross plaque \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my mirror that has been reported by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>It worked better when I held the case by the thin sides, instead of pressing it in the middle of the flat sides.  </li>
            <li>Strong for those tuff to reach places, yet thin enough to get between your teeth.</li>
            <li>This has those little micro-grooves that really do gently grab.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening feature, well, I don&#x27;t really know how the little baking soda on the tiny surface of a floss can make a difference.</li>
            <li>The bad part is for some reasons anything that was good</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product from Reach.  </li>
            <li> The best way to floss is to sort of pull the floss to the side, making a C-shape with the floss, to get the floss to scrape the side of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> Not the best thing if you just want to floss and go to bed</li>
            <li> This floss is excellent.</li>
            <li> The best dental floss I have used .</li>
            <li> Perfect flossing care.</li>

            <li> this is the best</li>

            <li> This was an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> best denal floss  </li>
            <li> best price</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson is a very good company</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred and cleans our teeth beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t experienced any floss breakage while flossing.  </li>
            <li> I think this floss does a great job of removing plaque between your teeth, but I don&#x27;t believe it holds up to its claim of removing stains.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a great floss, in that it didn&#x27;t fray when I was using it</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, great floss but don&#x27;t expect to cure cancer with it, unless of course you are Macgyver.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so great at keeping it ON the floss as you remove it from in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very effective at removing plaque and objects you might have between your teeth.    </li>
            <li> Good product, bought the 6 pack as it was a really great deal.  </li>
            <li> That was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very easy floss to use!  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist with good reason.</li>
            <li> It feels like it does a good job removing plaque from between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It glides between the tightest places and does a superior job.  </li>
            <li> Good dental hygiene itself will provide good breath, attractive teeth and healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was shipped in record speed and our family is very very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> So glad you carry it that I ordered a pack of 6!</li>
            <li> I love this floss!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite products!  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought the set of six!</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t bother you to have your junk fling and fly off the floss, it IS an easy dental floss to use in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I welcome the elasticity of this floss, allowing easy access to interdental spaces.</li>
            <li> best floss - if you don&#x27;t have large spaces between your teeth (or even if you do)</li>
            <li> you want to get into the habit of flossing - and we all should - then it&#x27;s important that you find a product that you are happy with.  </li>
            <li> Kind of elastic.</li>
            <li> Has a good mint taste to make flossing a bit more tolerable...highly recommended..</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with that information and now purchase this product in multipacks.</li>
            <li> Truly effective...</li>
            <li> I really liked this floss.  </li>
            <li> This new floss by REACH has a splendid mint smell and the great taste of it never leaves the floss.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use  superior technology.</li>
            <li> Very easy to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> Its very strong and non waxy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most amazing thing.  </li>
            <li> this is the best dental floss as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Good clean feeling, no pain.</li>
            <li> The mint taste (quite distinct) makes it more pleasant to use than most.  </li>
            <li> I love this floss.</li>
            <li> I went from flossing once a month to flossing sometimes more than once per day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure a lot of this does go to the credit of the baking soda.  </li>
            <li> People need to learn how to floss and brush correctly and make sure they brush twice a day and floss once a day.  </li>
            <li> My favorite floss.</li>
            <li> Reach floss, like the Reach toothbrush, is just a bit better than its competition.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, this floss actually does help to whiten teeth in the corners and in-between where whitening kits and pastes just don&#x27;t do as well.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like dental tape rather than dental floss.     </li>
            <li> and I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Mint Floss, 100yards, for many years.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> great product, works well and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This was one of the most interesting dental flosses I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> How can it not remove more?  </li>
            <li> but feel better about it with the added ease that product gives.</li>
            <li> Maybe by the end of the roll, I&#x27;ll be able to tell but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening effect, I&#x27;m sure it does help to whiten the edges of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and maybe it feels a bit more plastic than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better, and I hope Reach keeps it.</li>
            <li> it surely doesn&#x27;t seem like it even cleans your teeth at all.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and my hygienist was able to remove most of the staining, but not that in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this brand and find it to be better than most others.</li>
            <li> better than the glide stuff that you can&#x27;t even keep on your finger.</li>
            <li> will buy more of this soon.</li>
            <li> Reach total care is the best floss</li>
            <li> My only drawback was that I didn&#x27;t see a great impact in terms of whitening - particularly at the gumline where you would expect this floss to have the greatest impact on stains for coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I experienced some sticker shock over the price, being the kind of person who will grab a calculator and seeing how much she&#x27;s paying by the yard, but I guess pricey floss is worth it if it keeps you flossing.  </li>
            <li> I like to try new dental products, and was happy to give this one</li>
            <li> Great new product.</li>
            <li> The things is is that it is very hyped up in the description like it&#x27;s some kind of miracle floss, a floss with technological advantages and amazing benefits that no floss has even attempted to do before.  </li>
            <li> Some dental flosses have a strong aftertaste, in my opinion, but this Reach floss adds just a hint of mint without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Choose a brand of floss that is easy and enjoyable to use and USE IT FAITHFULLY.  </li>
            <li> Choose a brand of floss that is easy and enjoyable to use and USE IT FAITHFULLY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it so easily at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also this is a great value with a pack of 6, which totals nearly the size of 2 football fields(180 yards,)</li>
            <li> What I do like about Reach is the rubbery type material is more comfortable to use on my teeth</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve always preached, the prevention of cavities is more important than the appearance of one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve always preached, the prevention of cavities is more important than the appearance of one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and gets the areas between my teeth squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> This is probably the BEST dental floss because it would not break between my teeth, many other cheap ones would.  </li>
            <li> It easily gets between my teeth without getting stuck or caught.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever actually liked to floss...</li>
            <li> The best feature is that the floss stretches slightly, so if it does get stuck, you can easily jiggle it out without tearing it or ripping your teeth out.  </li>
            <li> This floss gets into those spaces just fine.  </li>
            <li> With that at free shipping it was an easy decision to make the switch</li>
            <li> Glad to order a half-dozen here that arrived quickly as promised.</li>
            <li> I find this floss makes the act of flossing more pleasant and easier and that is enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I initially actually LIKED how flexible it was - there is REALLY A LOT of give in this floss so that it&#x27;s really easy to manuever around your teeth in the nooks and crannies</li>
            <li> Best floss for those with tight contact between teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores here, so I got the brilliant idea of ordering it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One HUGE thing that I DID like about it?</li>
            <li> It seems to do an excellent job when it holds together, but maybe my teeth are especially rough or some thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it would whiten my teeth on it&#x27;s own, but I do used a whitening toothpaste as well</li>
            <li> It has a light minty taste, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The smooth, rounded edges prevent scratching one&#x27;s legs when poking against material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get this floss in the 90 length packaging if it is available.  </li>
            <li> It is made of a rubbery elastic type material so it almost acts like a sling shot removing plaque and spraying it on the mirror, can be quite displeasing to those of us with sensitive stomachs, but I guess it is a good sign that it is removing the debris.</li>
            <li> Prefer this brand and type as it does not break easily, is not slippery on the fingers, and does an excellent job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> If the Total Care Floss makes flossing easier and more enjoyable, then maybe the consumer will be more prone to use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyoser brands but does an excellent job of whitening my teeth and leaving them feeling slick when I pass my tongue over them.        </li>
            <li> If the Total Care Floss makes flossing easier and more enjoyable, then maybe the consumer will be more prone to use it.  </li>
            <li> but be sure to price this exact item at Wal-Mart before buying it on the Internet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a rather springy texture which may cause you to clean the mirror more often, since I had a higher ratio of stuff hitting the mirror</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean unless I&#x27;ve flossed.  </li>
            <li> This is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Also, I find this to be very minty and enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve got a mouth full of goo but even for the teeny smidge of ickies</li>
            <li> Our hygienist says our teeth have been super clean since using it.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the space between the teeth don&#x27;t whiten up enough with toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST floss for people who have super tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted as a new customer on Amazon to easily find it and procure a large supply at a reasonable per-item price.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresh and clean after I floss</li>
            <li> Great product and priced reasonably when compared with my local retail stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no easy cure for good teeth care and healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that some other flosses may &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; stuff between your teeth better, however, making flossing easy for me is better than not flossing at all.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say for certain if it is actually removing any stains, but the texturing sure makes it feel like it&#x27;s giving a good scrubbing between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The tape is very textured, so easy to hold on to...</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s still a pretty good dental floss.</li>
            <li> I floss regularly but always investigate new floss products when they come on the market just to see if it gets the plaque off more effectively.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it and was so happy to discover it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I yanked, and then the whole roll broke free from its package and went flying.</li>
            <li> the fun begins.  </li>
            <li> I used the entire package before writing this review, and I really liked this floss.  </li>
            <li> Turns out that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost, I never run out of Dental Floss and the Mint is my requirement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as whitening between the teeth I&#x27;ll have to work with it more time.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these mint flosses but why can&#x27;t any of them get the packaging right?</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> No other floss cleans in between my teeth better than this one.</li>
            <li> some people reviewing this product obviously don&#x27;t have teeth like mine--so tightly jammed together that it is work to get any kind of floss between, and even more work to get it out again!</li>
            <li> I really like this floss and have used only this kind for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> , I now have enough packages of that great floss to last me for awhile.</li>
            <li> Also it would be very good for that awkward time after new dental work when you can&#x27;t get any kind of floss between the teeth.</li>
            <li> floss is wide, but smooth and very good for people with really tight gaps between teeth.</li>
            <li> But its possible this floss is too smooth and doesnt clean much(-1)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just the first part of the joke.  </li>
            <li> Pretty funny,</li>
            <li> I ended up nearly slicing off my head trying to get the floss to fit between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this floss, I truly do - but not necessarily for the reasons it is promoting itself.  </li>
            <li> It is more like a plastic ribbon than a traditional floss \\&quot;string\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Dental floss is essential in keeping one&#x27;s teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> White teeth are not always healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li> White teeth are not always healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li> Whether it was coincidence or not, I got a headache the first time I used this floss.</li>
            <li> If hearing your floss TWANG as it snaps off your tooth bothers you, then you better get some regular floss.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally, so my Hygenist contacted the Representative for this product and said that it could be purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I checked the exact number of this item against Wal-Mart after I bought it</li>
            <li> It was first introduced to me when I went in to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I believe it does remove more junk than standard wax floss.  </li>
            <li> I think this product will actually help me to floss more often, as I am not a fan of the act of flossing-</li>
            <li> There are various styles of floss out there to buy but this is our favorite.  </li>
            <li> first downside is the size per price.</li>
            <li> Most floss products are 50 yards, this was 30 at the same price as the others.</li>
            <li> I was able to restring it properly and get it working.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that my teeth are any whiter since I&#x27;ve started using the floss (about three weeks), but there is definitely a pleasant, fresh-and-clean aftertaste of baking soda on your teeth after using it.</li>
            <li> Plus this floss is wider; it&#x27;s not a string but more like a flat ribbon.</li>
            <li> This particular floss REACH TOTAL CARE does not shred and is quite the best for flossing, especially if a person has multiple flossing challenges (ie bridges, implants, etc...).  </li>
            <li> so I really strive to keep my teeth as healthy as possible to avoid those heart-pounding sessions in the dental chair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wondering if I was stuck with the stuff my gums didn&#x27;t love for life, I did a little homework and ended up buying a pack of \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss, which was pretty comfortable, though not quite as comfortable as the Reach Total Care.  </li>
            <li> strength of this dental floss is amazing, I think I could probably use it to tie down the trunk of my car if needed (I might try it &amp;lt;grin&gt;).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus it is a good performing floss like most Reach floss options, but not sure the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; works well enough to justify paying more for this than any other Reach floss with the microgroove technology.</li>
            <li> If the Reach Total Care Floss will entice one to floss more often, then I highly recommend purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the Reach Total Care Floss will entice one to floss more often, then I highly recommend purchasing it.      </li>
            <li> That elasticity that makes it easy to pull into the tight spaces makes a rubber-band strumming \\&quot;ping\\&quot; sound when you pull it out of the teeth...</li>
            <li> Overall, 4-stars...possibly 4.5 stars because I do like the floss material more than normal floss.</li>
            <li> This type of floss is similar to &#x27;glide&#x27; type floss that is easy to get in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> positive - I really like the mint flavor of this floss.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t shred easy so it can last you for your whole flossing job.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the new Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss, 30 yards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say, I would really have my doubts as to how much whitening a dental floss can really do to teeth, but that&#x27;s just an opinion and not a claim of fact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that are very close together.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think this is a benefit that Reach wants to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I didn&#x27;t floss much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t understand how using this product to floss would whiten the front of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Does it really whiten?</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think the claim of whitening effect is really valid.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak much for the whitening factor.  </li>
            <li> This floss allows you to really get rid of the the food and plaque along your gumline and in between your teeth.     </li>
            <li> Also the floss is wider, flatter and very rubbery like rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> I can floss my teeth much faster.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t get used to this floss.</li>
            <li> Got it as a free sample from the dentist and was instantly hooked.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I really didn&#x27;t seem to be getting much plaque out from between my teeth, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reason that I gave the floss four stars is that I really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Reach product has, on occasion, broke, but very infrequently so I still want to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I never liked to floss because I would always wrap it around my fingers because I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip.  </li>
            <li> This floss is good at getting in the grooves between teeth with minimal fraying or breakage - and my teeth as relatively close together.  </li>
            <li> My recent experience trying different flosses has gone kind of like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  </li>
            <li> I liked the former but not the latter.</li>
            <li> Other than that fact, I really like this floss and will probably purchase more when what I have is gone.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find locally, so was happy to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to understand why all these dental floss for sales in the States were made overseas and most are not good while those for sales in Canada, many of them are made in U.S.A. and are of better quality.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change as far as the whitening effect, but I already use a whitening rinse and a whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is softer than classic floss and has an elastic-y consistency to it.</li>
            <li> The elasticity and strength of this floss is far more pleasing than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it more appealing, but it travels well inside a pocket, especially one pertaining to a tight pair of jeans.  </li>
            <li> This has worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this and the other floss I use.</li>
            <li> but the positive is that I end up cleaning the mirror and wall nearly every night.</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable to use than classic floss due to the elasticity of it and tastes just like any other mint floss.  </li>
            <li> and i find that even the idea that flossing will help with those tight tea stains does motivate me to floss more, so i call it a win-win situation, and order this in bulk.</li>
            <li> My teeth are tight and break most flosses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone whose teeth are close together.  </li>
            <li> (The mint flavoring is nice, too, but it&#x27;s not any different from other mint-flavored flosses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It arrived fine, on time and is what we expected.</li>
            <li> The floss string is different than other kind that I&#x27;ve tried-this has a thicker string.</li>
            <li> The biggest plus for this floss as compared to other brands is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t easily break.  </li>
            <li> I also like the semi-transparent box, which lets me know exactly how much floss is left in the box.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t think I would switch to this one as my main dental floss, but it does deserve a place next to my sink as a secondary, since it would be perfect for the times I occasionally break off a bit of my regular floss between a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li> It slides between teeth easily and feels like is cleans a larger area than a finer floss, but is not as big as a dental tape.</li>
            <li> Great floss, but poor dispenser design mars the total product.  </li>
            <li> I had been using excellent CVS Advanced Fiber floss (terrible name), but it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Who knows if it actually whitens, because from my experience, it does not hug the side of your tooth unless you floss with another type of floss first.  </li>
            <li> The floss works well but no better than most name brand dental floss.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Reach Total Care Floss was the sleek design of its container.  </li>
            <li> Rembrandt is more expensive than the other brands but does an excellent job of whitening my teeth and leaving them feeling slick when I pass my tongue over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and you are already faithfully flossing your teeth while using a whitening toothpaste, the extra money spent on purchasing the Reach Total Care Floss will not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and you are already faithfully flossing your teeth while using a whitening toothpaste, the extra money spent on purchasing the Reach Total Care Floss will not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it actually whitens but does leave a clean, fresh sensation after flossing.  </li>
            <li> It slips between the teeth really well, but it also has rough edges so that it picks up debris really well.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, there ARE varying types of dental floss - enough for me to take note.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf and they could not order it without my bringing in an old container.</li>
            <li> She was surprised, but said that she did use whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle of trying to get it between my teeth, so I will probably go back to the standard dental floss.</li>
            <li> The two stores that carry this product where I live have apparently discontinued selling it, so I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> you have teeth that are very tight and can&#x27;t get regular floss in between them, this would be better than not flossing at all.  </li>
            <li> I really do not see anything very special about this floss at all, besides that it is pink.      </li>
            <li> It really is like a piece of plastic ribbon, it&#x27;s flat.</li>
            <li> But there are other things that are worth considering in picking a dental floss besides shredding.</li>
            <li> (I hate it when it starts to break apart and unravel on the first tooth you use it on) and it tasted good (very minty).  </li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are very tight together and some with a comfortable space in between.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good as well-it doesn&#x27;t have a bad aftertaste or one that&#x27;s overly</li>
            <li> I had my teeth cleaned over six weeks ago and, despite the tremendous amount of coffee and tea that I drank, they are still white, even that crooked tooth in the middle of my bottom row that attracts stains like a magnet.  </li>
            <li> This seems better than my usual tiny threadlike floss...</li>
            <li> It really works, removes stuff between the teeth really well so that there is less plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> Really like this floss--it&#x27;s slightly stretchy and really traps the food.</li>
            <li> The thick strands slide easily between my teeth while making a loud popping noise.  </li>
            <li> normally use another floss by the same manufacturer that is non-whitening and have never had any</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for years but lately have not been able to find it in local retail stores.  </li>
            <li> , there is no other product like it at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my one major pet peeve with dental floss...</li>
            <li> This floss is like no other floss.  </li>
            <li> According to the Reach web site, the most popular floss brand (the least expensive and the one that I use) is the Reach Mint Waxed Floss; it cleans teeth and prevents plaque buildup just as well as the Reach Total Care Floss.  </li>
            <li> According to the Reach web site, the most popular floss brand (the least expensive and the one that I use) is the Reach Mint Waxed Floss; it cleans teeth and prevents plaque buildup just as well as the Reach Total Care Floss.  </li>
            <li> Those pre-threaded \\&quot;picks\\&quot; make it a little more convenient, but were even more uncomfortable as I really had to push down to get them between the teeth, resulting in a gum-thwacking \\&quot;snap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really disliked the way many of the other floss products I&#x27;d tried broke off during my flossing.  </li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact, it hardly breaks and it fits inbetween tight contacts pretty easily.</li>
            <li> , is that it is loud when pulling back out from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Reach Mint Waxed Floss barely has a mint taste, let alone a smell.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums and this is the only floss I&#x27;ve found that hasn&#x27;t hurt to use.  </li>
            <li> This floss is wide, slips into place like Glide, but unlike Glide, has grooved surfaces that really scour teeth.</li>
            <li> I think, in a way, it works better than a thin string in getting anything in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving Reach Total Care a try, I noticed right away how comfortably the weird stretchy tape slipped between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s got &#x27;boing&#x27; to it, it wasn&#x27;t easy to KEEP the goo on the floss as I tried to bypass the icky used part to move onto the next part of the floss.  </li>
            <li> odd thing is, my dentist and I agree that my teeth are pretty closely spaced.  </li>
            <li> Either way, you&#x27;ll need to at least be able to get used to the elasticity of the floss long enough for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main complaint, and reason for dropping a star, down to 4, is this stuff snags, then breaks fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It glides nicely without shredding or breaking apart as I do have a couple of teeth that are very close together and tight which makes getting some kinds of floss in and out difficult.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the couple of weeks that I have been using it, but this is like any other whitening toothpaste or similar product in that it more than likely only makes a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t really get the gross plaque \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my mirror that has been reported by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> It worked better when I held the case by the thin sides, instead of pressing it in the middle of the flat sides.  </li>
            <li> Strong for those tuff to reach places, yet thin enough to get between your teeth.</li>
            <li> This has those little micro-grooves that really do gently grab.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening feature, well, I don&#x27;t really know how the little baking soda on the tiny surface of a floss can make a difference.</li>
            <li> The bad part is for some reasons anything that was good</li>
            <li> This particular brand is difficult for me to find locally, but I bought it here and can see a difference quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a little more elastic than traditional floss, so it &#x27;gives&#x27; a little and breaks less frequently that other tape style floss.</li>
            <li> I normally floss everyday even prior to using Reach.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are spaced very closely, so flossing is usually a challenge.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bit flat - some are waxy and some aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I use dental floss religiously at home and at work; I use it every time I brush my teeth which is at least twice a day, sometimes as much as five</li>
            <li> seem excessive, especially compared to normal baseline flossing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth fit very tightly together and it is hard for me to find a floss that will not break or shred when I am flossing.</li>
            <li> Also because of that, you can actually use a much shorter piece of floss allowing less waste.</li>
            <li> and it is so hard getting them out without pulling apart the whole thing.</li>
            <li> This is the poorest dental floss I have purchased in a LONG time.</li>
            <li> The product works as expected as I have been using it for several years.  </li>
            <li> the company usually stopped making them and this dental is not cheap in the after market but IMHO is worth every single penny of it.  </li>
            <li> It does make me sad when companies seem to stretch for even more gimmicks to sell products that people will think will work miracles or make them have to work less.  </li>
            <li> Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss is what it is - it&#x27;s a dental floss, no more and no less.</li>
            <li> The other six pack was Reach Total Care with Listerine flavors which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> no slipping while pulling into those tight spots.  </li>
            <li> FYI, you can buy a single unit at Target to try it out.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty tight together, which makes it hard to find floss that doesn&#x27;t fray or break.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricier (not much, but somewhat) than other brands I buy, and since it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the others, I&#x27;ll stick with the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is extremely difficult to open the palm-sized package lid to get to the floss.  </li>
            <li> As such, it doesn&#x27;t shred in the space between the tight teeth.</li>
            <li> The only floss I will use because it gets into all spaces no matter how tight and will not fray.</li>
            <li> While some floss products will split like a thread, this one is tough and does not deteriorate and yet it is gentle on your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I can hold onto it with wet fingers, does not slip, so that I do not have to wrap it around my finger and cut off circulation.</li>
            <li> It also did get the gunk out from between my teeth, and with minimal shredding.  </li>
            <li> It clings to my fingers so that the string isn&#x27;t continually slipping off</li>
            <li> I only bought the 30 length because the 90 was not available at the time.  </li>
            <li> Product was delivered as specified in my order and it was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> and you can grip it without slipping</li>
            <li> Too bad because the texture cleans better than other flosses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Total Care Floss for the past couple of years and really like the way It gets in between my teeth to get out what brushing leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> I have some VERY tight spaces between my teeth...shreds regular floss and even breaks Glide.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll also echo what some other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; claim is meant to work in conjunction with using other teeth whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With other floss you have to go in with yet another length of floss to get the remaining pieces out.  </li>
            <li> The floss itself is also made of a material that is stretchy and has an elastic way to it that makes flossing and maneuvering between teeth a lot easier than other styles I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the cheaper generic floss.</li>
            <li> While I got the plaque pretty well with whatever was waxed and cheapest in the stores, I tended to dread and sometimes skip the uncomfortable chore.  </li>
            <li> Does not break like other floss, and cleans well without waxing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I did not add/subtract any stars due to whitening/lack of because I just dont know yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have resorted to on line order of this product as my usual local sources have discontinued it for some reason....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the other flosses on the market....</li>
            <li> the wax floss removed quite a bit of what was left behind from the Reach Total Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I mean HOW different can dental floss be from one another.  </li>
            <li> The floss has an odd elastic quality.</li>
            <li> I happen to hate having any taste in the floss since it makes me salivate, thus making the flossing experience more messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the typical dental floss</li>
            <li> breaks every time I use it about half way through flossing.</li>
            <li> However, because of this design, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as removing food as traditional wax floss which allows the food to grab onto the floss and remove it from teeth.  </li>
            <li> Brushing alone is not good enough.  </li>
            <li> That depends on how tight your teeth are.</li>
            <li> EVEN on my not so tight spots.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it is stretchy and works in tight places.</li>
            <li> Gets in all the crevices,especially those tight spots.</li>
            <li> I like this dental floss – it works well and does not break, and does not leave little pieces of string between your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a little stretchy which seems to help it slide.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it seems a little &amp;#34;stretchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This was pricey, but for some reason this floss is very hard to find locally in stores, and I wanted.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is tasty, but the floss is so wide, that it is hard to get through teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using this floss, I don&#x27;t see any difference with stains or the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with Reach Total Care Listerine, which is stringy and ineffective.</li>
            <li> In fact, it doesn&#x27;t even look or feel like floss, as it is very thick and flat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this thing for the past 2 months and there has been no significant results.</li>
            <li> i think it helps me, but then i am a dedicated tea drinker with very very tight teeth, so there are places no amount of brushing with whitening toothpaste will ever reach.</li>
            <li> Too thick if you have tight contacts.</li>
            <li> I am not sure as I just started to use this product.</li>
            <li> However, for the past year, I have been using a whitening toothpaste manufactured by either Crest, Colgate or Rembrandt.  </li>
            <li> I used it, but if you like that mint taste &amp; vaguely salty twang of baking soda toothpastes (I do), you&#x27;ll like the taste of Reach Total Care</li>
            <li> then I do with my regular floss, sort of a difficult to control slingshot effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure that it does anything toward whitening as the package claims.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so hard to find a floss that doesn&#x27;t shred and stay caught between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Like all floss, it is hard to grip and use, but, trying to not to hold that against it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now hard to find in the corner drug stores, but my dental hygienist likes it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I tried this floss because I am a flossing fanatic.  </li>
            <li> I do hope that this product stays online at least</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s just floss, but it doesn&#x27;t feel quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately the past 6 - 7 months</li>
            <li> One star off because this floss is very messy!</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d rather use the thinner less expensive floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels more like a plastic/rubber base than a cloth base, and stretches like rubber.</li>
            <li> I am only disappointed that the manufacturer will no longer be producing this product.</li>
            <li> The floss was cutting down into the spool, instead of reeling out.  </li>
            <li> The spool was binding in the case, making it very hard to pull the floss.  </li>
            <li> For a little background, I have been a daily user of dental floss since 1982 when I had an encounter with a rather vicious dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of stretchy and stretches thin to get in there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flimsy, thin, rips faster than any dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thin and slippery</li>
            <li> This floss is thin and it stretches.  </li>
            <li> However, the difference is not that dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Once a day without fail.  </li>
            <li> and it makes the floss EXTREMELY difficult to hold on to.      </li>
            <li> &gt;  If you are already using a whitening toothpaste, then do you need to also use an expensive whitening floss?  </li>
            <li> If you are already using a whitening toothpaste, then do you need to also use an expensive whitening floss?  </li>
            <li> Too difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I found it just awkward and difficult to get used</li>
            <li> Some floss tends to split, or shred, and I find that really annoying.  </li>
            <li> so I guess they are now working together in my mouth to fend off those evil coffee stains.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this floss. It slips between the teeth really well, but it also has rough edges so that it picks up debris really well.</li>
            <li> Great product and priced reasonably when compared with my local retail stores.  This particular floss REACH TOTAL CARE does not shred and is quite the best for flossing, especially if a person has multiple flossing challenges (ie bridges, implants, etc...).  The only suggestion that I would make to Johnson &amp; Johnson would be to make the container 50 yards versus 30 yards.  That is the only reason for the 4 star versus 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped in record speed and our family is very very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product from Reach.  While some floss products will split like a thread, this one is tough and does not deteriorate and yet it is gentle on your teeth and gums.  Also this is a great value with a pack of 6, which totals nearly the size of 2 football fields(180 yards,) so buy it and forget it for a looooooong time.</li>
            <li> What is \\&quot;trick\\&quot; dental floss, you might ask.  Well, here&#x27;s how it works.  This Reach Total Care Plus Whitening dental floss is a way to get back at somebody you don&#x27;t like.  Hand them this package of floss.  First of all, it is extremely difficult to open the palm-sized package lid to get to the floss.  This is just the first part of the joke.  Then they tear off a piece and proceed to floss their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the fun begins.  Once flossing, any particles stuck between the teeth impede the floss from doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do; scrape the sides of the teeth.  The floss snaps and jumps out of the space between the teeth, and snaps them on the lip.  They might see blood.  Pretty funny, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I tried this floss because I am a flossing fanatic.  Once a day without fail.  My dental hygienist tells me I have the cleanest teeth.  This floss has an elastic spring to it.  I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they made this.  When the floss hits a particle, it actually pops out.  It&#x27;s the most amazing thing.  Who knows if it actually whitens, because from my experience, it does not hug the side of your tooth unless you floss with another type of floss first.  The best way to floss is to sort of pull the floss to the side, making a C-shape with the floss, to get the floss to scrape the side of the tooth.  Then do it again on the opposite side.  I couldn&#x27;t accomplish that with this floss. But I might save it for an April Fool&#x27;s day joke on somebody.</li>
            <li> After using Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss for three weeks, I actually do see a slight difference on the sides of one particular tooth that was stained by coffee.  However, the difference is not that dramatic.  The mint flavor is tasty, but the floss is so wide, that it is hard to get through teeth that are very close together.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t even look or feel like floss, as it is very thick and flat. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle of trying to get it between my teeth, so I will probably go back to the standard dental floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Reach floss for about a month.  Overall I like the floss but claims of whitening seem excessive, especially compared to normal baseline flossing.  I normally floss everyday even prior to using Reach.  I&#x27;ve see no additional whiteness since using Reach.  What I do like about Reach is the rubbery type material is more comfortable to use on my teeth and i haven&#x27;t experienced any floss breakage while flossing.  Overall, 4-stars...possibly 4.5 stars because I do like the floss material more than normal floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental phobe so I really strive to keep my teeth as healthy as possible to avoid those heart-pounding sessions in the dental chair. I like to try new dental products, and was happy to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss is what it is - it&#x27;s a dental floss, no more and no less. The floss works well but no better than most name brand dental floss. My teeth are spaced very closely, so flossing is usually a challenge. The Reach floss wasn&#x27;t any different. I ended up nearly slicing off my head trying to get the floss to fit between some of my teeth. Plus this floss is wider; it&#x27;s not a string but more like a flat ribbon. Once between my teeth, the floss works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also echo what some other reviewers have noted. The floss has an odd elastic quality. It has a tendency to spring out of my mouth during use. Anything on the floss ends up on the mirror and bathroom wall. Not the best thing if you just want to floss and go to bed but the positive is that I end up cleaning the mirror and wall nearly every night. However, I don&#x27;t think this is a benefit that Reach wants to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this floss, I don&#x27;t see any difference with stains or the whiteness of my teeth. Perhaps the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; claim is meant to work in conjunction with using other teeth whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive - I really like the mint flavor of this floss. Some dental flosses have a strong aftertaste, in my opinion, but this Reach floss adds just a hint of mint without being overwhelming. That was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is floss. It&#x27;s a bit pricier (not much, but somewhat) than other brands I buy, and since it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the others, I&#x27;ll stick with the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these mint flosses but why can&#x27;t any of them get the packaging right? I always seem to have the problem of the strips getting stuck inside the container and it is so hard getting them out without pulling apart the whole thing. It&#x27;s like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube but in an opposite sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; claim also disturbs me. I have been using this thing for the past 2 months and there has been no significant results.</li>
            <li> I like this dental floss – it works well and does not break, and does not leave little pieces of string between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I never liked to floss because I would always wrap it around my fingers because I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip.  After a couple minutes,  I felt like my fingers were being cut off.  So, I didn&#x27;t floss much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss? Very easy to hold onto.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to wrap my fingers at all, so that&#x27;s a big plus for me.  I&#x27;ve read that some other flosses may &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; stuff between your teeth better, however, making flossing easy for me is better than not flossing at all.  Also, I find this to be very minty and enjoyable.  Great stuff, I highly recommend it.  I went from flossing once a month to flossing sometimes more than once per day.  Different floss changed my world. 5/5.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST floss for people who have super tight teeth.  The best feature is that the floss stretches slightly, so if it does get stuck, you can easily jiggle it out without tearing it or ripping your teeth out.  Or you can just stretch it and it becomes thinner so you can just pull it through.  I was so upset when they took it out of the stores..Furious.  Because it&#x27;s so hard to find a floss that doesn&#x27;t shred and stay caught between your teeth.  With other floss you have to go in with yet another length of floss to get the remaining pieces out.  I do hope that this product stays online at least, there is no other product like it at all.</li>
            <li> I think this floss does a great job of removing plaque between your teeth, but I don&#x27;t believe it holds up to its claim of removing stains.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately the past 6 - 7 months and I&#x27;ve seen zero change in the stains that accumulate after my dental cleaning.  I think this product is very effective at removing plaque and objects you might have between your teeth.    One star off because this floss is very messy! It is made of a rubbery elastic type material so it almost acts like a sling shot removing plaque and spraying it on the mirror, can be quite displeasing to those of us with sensitive stomachs, but I guess it is a good sign that it is removing the debris.</li>
            <li> My main complaint, and reason for dropping a star, down to 4, is this stuff snags, then breaks fairly easily. It seems to do an excellent job when it holds together, but maybe my teeth are especially rough or some thing.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist with good reason. Comfortable to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great floss, in that it didn&#x27;t fray when I was using it (I hate it when it starts to break apart and unravel on the first tooth you use it on) and it tasted good (very minty).  The things is is that it is very hyped up in the description like it&#x27;s some kind of miracle floss, a floss with technological advantages and amazing benefits that no floss has even attempted to do before.  To me, it&#x27;s just floss.  I don&#x27;t really know if it would whiten my teeth on it&#x27;s own, but I do used a whitening toothpaste as well so I guess they are now working together in my mouth to fend off those evil coffee stains.  Nonetheless, great floss but don&#x27;t expect to cure cancer with it, unless of course you are Macgyver.</li>
            <li> I love this floss, I truly do - but not necessarily for the reasons it is promoting itself.  I have some teeth that are very tight together and some with a comfortable space in between.  I floss regularly but always investigate new floss products when they come on the market just to see if it gets the plaque off more effectively.  This new floss by REACH has a splendid mint smell and the great taste of it never leaves the floss.  The floss itself is also made of a material that is stretchy and has an elastic way to it that makes flossing and maneuvering between teeth a lot easier than other styles I have tried.  My teeth feel fresh and clean after I floss and I&#x27;m sure a lot of this does go to the credit of the baking soda.  But I give this product 4 stars for the question is does the floss and the baking soda added truly whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no easy cure for good teeth care and healthy gums.  People need to learn how to floss and brush correctly and make sure they brush twice a day and floss once a day.  Good dental hygiene itself will provide good breath, attractive teeth and healthy gums.  When you floss correctly you are gliding the floss over the sides of the teeth to remove the plaque.  I really can&#x27;t understand how using this product to floss would whiten the front of your teeth.  It does make me sad when companies seem to stretch for even more gimmicks to sell products that people will think will work miracles or make them have to work less.  Bottom line you must take care of your teeth.  I find this floss makes the act of flossing more pleasant and easier and that is enough for me.  If for some reason it ends up adding whitening then that will be a bonus.</li>
            <li> Like all floss, it is hard to grip and use, but, trying to not to hold that against it.  I really do not see anything very special about this floss at all, besides that it is pink.      The \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; aspect doesn&#x27;t actually help whiten your teeth and it makes the floss EXTREMELY difficult to hold on to.      Pass.  This is nothing special.  Even for people who like to floss.</li>
            <li> This Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss passed my basic test for dental floss with flying colors: it does not shred at all. For that alone it earns a solid 5 stars. I also like the semi-transparent box, which lets me know exactly how much floss is left in the box.    But there are other things that are worth considering in picking a dental floss besides shredding. Do you like Mint taste? I happen to hate having any taste in the floss since it makes me salivate, thus making the flossing experience more messy. Do you like stretchy floss that, as another reviewer has pointed out, has a tendency to send debris onto your mirror? That depends on how tight your teeth are. As for the whitening feature, well, I don&#x27;t really know how the little baking soda on the tiny surface of a floss can make a difference. That&#x27;s why I still see my dental hygienist regularly.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss. So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this and the other floss I use.</li>
            <li> Reach floss, like the Reach toothbrush, is just a bit better than its competition.  The package is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t fall apart, which is a problem with lots of otherwise serviceable store brands of floss.  The floss itself does not split or come apart.  Best of all, this floss actually does help to whiten teeth in the corners and in-between where whitening kits and pastes just don&#x27;t do as well.  I used the entire package before writing this review, and I really liked this floss.  I will purchase it in the store.  (The mint flavoring is nice, too, but it&#x27;s not any different from other mint-flavored flosses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have some VERY tight spaces between my teeth...shreds regular floss and even breaks Glide.  This floss gets into those spaces just fine.  It&#x27;s sort of stretchy and stretches thin to get in there.  The tape is very textured, so easy to hold on to...no slipping while pulling into those tight spots.  It feels like it does a good job removing plaque from between my teeth.  What I don&#x27;t like, and haven&#x27;t yet decided if it&#x27;s enough to keep me from getting this floss next time, is that it is loud when pulling back out from between the teeth.  That elasticity that makes it easy to pull into the tight spaces makes a rubber-band strumming \\&quot;ping\\&quot; sound when you pull it out of the teeth...EVEN on my not so tight spots.  Can&#x27;t really say for certain if it is actually removing any stains, but the texturing sure makes it feel like it&#x27;s giving a good scrubbing between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss works fantastic. It easily gets between my teeth without getting stuck or caught. It glides nicely without shredding or breaking apart as I do have a couple of teeth that are very close together and tight which makes getting some kinds of floss in and out difficult. The floss also tastes good...which is always a plus. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5? Does it really whiten? I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the couple of weeks that I have been using it, but this is like any other whitening toothpaste or similar product in that it more than likely only makes a very slight difference. Other than that fact, I really like this floss and will probably purchase more when what I have is gone.</li>
            <li> Dental floss is dental floss, right? I mean HOW different can dental floss be from one another.  Much to my surprise, there ARE varying types of dental floss - enough for me to take note.  I&#x27;m used to the typical dental floss that&#x27;s a bit flat - some are waxy and some aren&#x27;t.  This Reach Total Care PLUS Whitening Mint Floss removes debris off of your teeth quite well but it&#x27;s not so great at keeping it ON the floss as you remove it from in between your teeth.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve got a mouth full of goo but even for the teeny smidge of ickies, I don&#x27;t want it &#x27;boining&#x27; back into my mouth or flinging on the mirror like another reviewer mentioned.  Ummm...EEWWWW.    I initially actually LIKED how flexible it was - there is REALLY A LOT of give in this floss so that it&#x27;s really easy to manuever around your teeth in the nooks and crannies but since it&#x27;s got &#x27;boing&#x27; to it, it wasn&#x27;t easy to KEEP the goo on the floss as I tried to bypass the icky used part to move onto the next part of the floss.  I&#x27;ve used it now daily until the entire package is gone and I&#x27;ve noticed ZILCH whitening effect at all.  NADA.  So I don&#x27;t think the claim of whitening effect is really valid.  If it doesn&#x27;t bother you to have your junk fling and fly off the floss, it IS an easy dental floss to use in my opinion.  One HUGE thing that I DID like about it? I like how it doesn&#x27;t shred.  That&#x27;s my one major pet peeve with dental floss...that when you pull it out, it shreds and sometimes even leaves a smidge string or two which then you have to manage to get out of your teeth.  This one NEVER shred at all which I thought was a plus, hence my 3 stars vs a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> The Johnson &amp; Johnson REACH Total Care plus whitening floss breaks every time I use it about half way through flossing. It&#x27;s no better than the cheaper generic floss.</li>
            <li> It arrived fine, on time and is what we expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This type of floss is similar to &#x27;glide&#x27; type floss that is easy to get in between teeth.  However, because of this design, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as removing food as traditional wax floss which allows the food to grab onto the floss and remove it from teeth.  I tried flossing with this Reach Total Care floss, and then I flossed with traditional wax floss and the wax floss removed quite a bit of what was left behind from the Reach Total Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak much for the whitening factor.  I must say, I would really have my doubts as to how much whitening a dental floss can really do to teeth, but that&#x27;s just an opinion and not a claim of fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have teeth that are very tight and can&#x27;t get regular floss in between them, this would be better than not flossing at all.  But I would say if you can use regular type wax floss, then I would recommend it over this product.</li>
            <li> This floss is excellent. It is on the thicker side, which I personally prefer. It feels more like dental tape rather than dental floss.     This floss allows you to really get rid of the the food and plaque along your gumline and in between your teeth.     I am not sure that my teeth are any whiter since I&#x27;ve started using the floss (about three weeks), but there is definitely a pleasant, fresh-and-clean aftertaste of baking soda on your teeth after using it.</li>
            <li> I like the Reach Total Care Dental Floss Plus Whitening. It is more like a plastic ribbon than a traditional floss \\&quot;string\\&quot;. As such, it doesn&#x27;t shred in the space between the tight teeth. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a waxy floss either. It really is like a piece of plastic ribbon, it&#x27;s flat. It has a light minty taste, not overpowering. Another plus is that it claims to whiten teeth with baking soda. I am not sure as I just started to use this product. We&#x27;ll see. My dentist and hygienist also recommend the Reach floss. I like it and I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li> This was pricey, but for some reason this floss is very hard to find locally in stores, and I wanted.</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson is a brand I can trust.  I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Mint Floss, 100yards, for many years.  I have ample supplies of it. (See my posted photographs.)  I use dental floss religiously at home and at work; I use it every time I brush my teeth which is at least twice a day, sometimes as much as five times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dental floss is essential in keeping one&#x27;s teeth and gums healthy.  Brushing alone is not good enough.  My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean unless I&#x27;ve flossed.  I was very excited when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the new Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Mint Floss, 30 yards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing I noticed about the Reach Total Care Floss was the sleek design of its container.  Not only is it more appealing, but it travels well inside a pocket, especially one pertaining to a tight pair of jeans.  The smooth, rounded edges prevent scratching one&#x27;s legs when poking against material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The second thing I noticed about the Reach Total Care Floss was that it had a stronger mint smell.  I could detect it through the wrapper.  The Reach Mint Waxed Floss barely has a mint taste, let alone a smell.  I can taste the mint when I use the Reach Total Care Floss.  Also the floss is wider, flatter and very rubbery like rubber bands.  The thick strands slide easily between my teeth while making a loud popping noise.  Also, it did surprise me once when it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Reach Total Care Floss is easier to grip and its stretchy material makes it easier to slide between teeth.  I can floss my teeth much faster.  My teeth feel cleaner after using the Reach Total Care Floss.  I had my teeth cleaned over six weeks ago and, despite the tremendous amount of coffee and tea that I drank, they are still white, even that crooked tooth in the middle of my bottom row that attracts stains like a magnet.  However, for the past year, I have been using a whitening toothpaste manufactured by either Crest, Colgate or Rembrandt.  Rembrandt is more expensive than the other brands but does an excellent job of whitening my teeth and leaving them feeling slick when I pass my tongue over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are already using a whitening toothpaste, then do you need to also use an expensive whitening floss?  Your wallet will have to answer this question.  According to the Reach web site, the most popular floss brand (the least expensive and the one that I use) is the Reach Mint Waxed Floss; it cleans teeth and prevents plaque buildup just as well as the Reach Total Care Floss.  However, the Total Care Floss is easier to use and is suppose to whiten teeth.  If the Total Care Floss makes flossing easier and more enjoyable, then maybe the consumer will be more prone to use it.  Thus the consumer will have fewer cavities. Fewer cavities will justify the extra cost between the Reach Mint Waxed Floss and the Reach Total Care Floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, if you are like me and you are already faithfully flossing your teeth while using a whitening toothpaste, the extra money spent on purchasing the Reach Total Care Floss will not be cost effective.  As I&#x27;ve always preached, the prevention of cavities is more important than the appearance of one&#x27;s teeth.  White teeth are not always healthy teeth.  Choose a brand of floss that is easy and enjoyable to use and USE IT FAITHFULLY.  If the Reach Total Care Floss will entice one to floss more often, then I highly recommend purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

            <li> This floss is good at getting in the grooves between teeth with minimal fraying or breakage - and my teeth as relatively close together.  It functions well for removing plaque and &#x60;gunk&#x27; between teeth - so I like the microgroove technology.  My only drawback was that I didn&#x27;t see a great impact in terms of whitening - particularly at the gumline where you would expect this floss to have the greatest impact on stains for coffee and tea.  Thus it is a good performing floss like most Reach floss options, but not sure the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; works well enough to justify paying more for this than any other Reach floss with the microgroove technology.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is stretchy and works in tight places. I have reordered it.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d rather use the thinner less expensive floss.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering these again.  Too difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Good clean feeling, no pain.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums and this is the only floss I&#x27;ve found that hasn&#x27;t hurt to use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss that actually works for me.  I&#x27;m not sure that it actually whitens but does leave a clean, fresh sensation after flossing.  I have had trouble finding it and was so happy to discover it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> One day I splurged and bought this floss at the local drug store as it was probably the most expensive one on the rack. Turns out that it was worth it. It really works, removes stuff between the teeth really well so that there is less plaque buildup. I can hold onto it with wet fingers, does not slip, so that I do not have to wrap it around my finger and cut off circulation. Am I the only one who can&#x27;t stand that? Also because of that, you can actually use a much shorter piece of floss allowing less waste. The floss does not shred either so there is never the leaving of tiny stringy pieces inbetween the teeth. In fact, it hardly breaks and it fits inbetween tight contacts pretty easily. Now I can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf and they could not order it without my bringing in an old container. Can you imagine, that would be 3 total trips to the drug store just for floss? So glad you carry it that I ordered a pack of 6!</li>
            <li> Great new product. Easy to use  superior technology.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I tried out this floss, and maybe we&#x27;re just used to regular floss, but we both felt it was like flossing with a rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question the whitening ability of floss vs. the whitening ability of whitening toothpaste. Either way, you&#x27;ll need to at least be able to get used to the elasticity of the floss long enough for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We normally use another floss by the same manufacturer that is non-whitening and have never had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the whitening and can stand the stretchy-ness of the floss, then go for it. If not, just use whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, my sister had headaches and when she asked the doctor, he asked point blank if she were using whitening toothpaste. She was surprised, but said that she did use whitening toothpaste. She stopped using whitening toothpaste and the headaches stopped. Whether it was coincidence or not, I got a headache the first time I used this floss.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t get used to this floss. It&#x27;s a bit stretchy. Kind of elastic. Rubbery even. It just doesn&#x27;t feel like the floss I&#x27;m used to. I can&#x27;t handle the change. It works okay. I mean, it&#x27;s just floss, but it doesn&#x27;t feel quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for this whitening gimmick, I have no idea. Maybe the floss whitens a bit. I sort of have my doubts though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up, if you think you might like stretchy floss, buy this product. If hearing your floss TWANG as it snaps off your tooth bothers you, then you better get some regular floss.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I just wished the packaging were not so wasteful.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost, I never run out of Dental Floss and the Mint is my requirement.  Does not shred.</li>
            <li> This floss is like no other floss.  Strong for those tuff to reach places, yet thin enough to get between your teeth. Has a good mint taste to make flossing a bit more tolerable...highly recommended..</li>
            <li> The best dental floss I have used .</li>
            <li> Too thick if you have tight contacts. Too bad because the texture cleans better than other flosses.</li>
            <li> Perfect flossing care.</li>
            <li> My teeth fit very tightly together and it is hard for me to find a floss that will not break or shred when I am flossing. I had been ordering Reach Total Care in the 90 yard packages, however, this price beat that one in price this time. With that at free shipping it was an easy decision to make the switch</li>
            <li> Gets in all the crevices,especially those tight spots.</li>
            <li> I love this floss! My Dental Hygenist said she felt it was the best for my teeth since they are close together. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally, so my Hygenist contacted the Representative for this product and said that it could be purchased through Amazon. I was thrilled with that information and now purchase this product in multipacks. No other floss cleans in between my teeth better than this one. Even my Hygenist agrees!</li>
            <li> great product, works well and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good product, bought the 6 pack as it was a really great deal.  Johnson &amp; Johnson is a very good company so REACH met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> some people reviewing this product obviously don&#x27;t have teeth like mine--so tightly jammed together that it is work to get any kind of floss between, and even more work to get it out again! i could not become a regular flosser until i found the &amp;#34;reach total care&amp;#34; brand, because floss just cut and shredded and got stuck between my teeth. it sucked. now i floss twice a day, because i CAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;um, does it whiten? i think it helps me, but then i am a dedicated tea drinker with very very tight teeth, so there are places no amount of brushing with whitening toothpaste will ever reach. and i find that even the idea that flossing will help with those tight tea stains does motivate me to floss more, so i call it a win-win situation, and order this in bulk.</li>
            <li> this is the best dental floss as far as I am concerned. but be sure to price this exact item at Wal-Mart before buying it on the Internet. I checked the exact number of this item against Wal-Mart after I bought it and I will tell  you what I just told you. Price it there before buying it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This is probably the BEST dental floss because it would not break between my teeth, many other cheap ones would.  The bad part is for some reasons anything that was good the company usually stopped making them and this dental is not cheap in the after market but IMHO is worth every single penny of it.  It was hard for me to understand why all these dental floss for sales in the States were made overseas and most are not good while those for sales in Canada, many of them are made in U.S.A. and are of better quality.  When I go to Canada, I always go to their Walmart and buy dental flosses made in USA there.</li>
            <li> The only floss I will use because it gets into all spaces no matter how tight and will not fray.</li>
            <li> If you have night teeth and keep breaking the floss, give this a try.  Got it as a free sample from the dentist and was instantly hooked.  It is a little more elastic than traditional floss, so it &#x27;gives&#x27; a little and breaks less frequently that other tape style floss.</li>
            <li> I found this floss to be much different from the rest. It was first introduced to me when I went in to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office. The consistency is similar to that of a rubber band which makes it resilient and elastic. Its very strong and non waxy. Truly effective...I&#x27;ll never go back to regular floss again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I love this product.</li>
            <li> My recent experience trying different flosses has gone kind of like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  While I got the plaque pretty well with whatever was waxed and cheapest in the stores, I tended to dread and sometimes skip the uncomfortable chore.  Those pre-threaded \\&quot;picks\\&quot; make it a little more convenient, but were even more uncomfortable as I really had to push down to get them between the teeth, resulting in a gum-thwacking \\&quot;snap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving Reach Total Care a try, I noticed right away how comfortably the weird stretchy tape slipped between my teeth.  Also, I didn&#x27;t really get the gross plaque \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my mirror that has been reported by other reviewers.  In fact, I really didn&#x27;t seem to be getting much plaque out from between my teeth, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering if I was stuck with the stuff my gums didn&#x27;t love for life, I did a little homework and ended up buying a pack of \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss, which was pretty comfortable, though not quite as comfortable as the Reach Total Care.  It also did get the gunk out from between my teeth, and with minimal shredding.  I experienced some sticker shock over the price, being the kind of person who will grab a calculator and seeing how much she&#x27;s paying by the yard, but I guess pricey floss is worth it if it keeps you flossing.  And away from the dental surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess for my tooth type or spacing, perhaps, I&#x27;ve found the product that is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;, although it&#x27;s not the Reach Total Care.  I couldn&#x27;t discern anything about this product&#x27;s whitening powers over the weeks I used it, but if you like that mint taste &amp; vaguely salty twang of baking soda toothpastes (I do), you&#x27;ll like the taste of Reach Total Care Plus Whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd thing is, my dentist and I agree that my teeth are pretty closely spaced.  Guess this is one of those cases where you just have to see what works for you.</li>
            <li> This was one of the most interesting dental flosses I have ever tried. For a little background, I have been a daily user of dental floss since 1982 when I had an encounter with a rather vicious dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;The strength of this dental floss is amazing, I think I could probably use it to tie down the trunk of my car if needed (I might try it &amp;lt;grin&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;It has a rather springy texture which may cause you to clean the mirror more often, since I had a higher ratio of stuff hitting the mirror then I do with my regular floss, sort of a difficult to control slingshot effect.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change as far as the whitening effect, but I already use a whitening rinse and a whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t think I would switch to this one as my main dental floss, but it does deserve a place next to my sink as a secondary, since it would be perfect for the times I occasionally break off a bit of my regular floss between a couple of teeth. Also it would be very good for that awkward time after new dental work when you can&#x27;t get any kind of floss between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite products!  I am a &amp;#34;Flosser&amp;#34;--always have been and this is the best product I have ever used.  It glides between the tightest places and does a superior job.  It is easy to handle and gets the areas between my teeth squeaky clean!  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Seems like they are trying to discontinue this to which I say NO!  I love this stuff.  It clings to my fingers so that the string isn&#x27;t continually slipping off and I believe it does remove more junk than standard wax floss.  How can it not remove more?  Standard wax floss is slippery.  This has those little micro-grooves that really do gently grab.</li>
            <li> I really liked this floss.  The material is softer than classic floss and has an elastic-y consistency to it. It is more comfortable to use than classic floss due to the elasticity of it and tastes just like any other mint floss.  I think this product will actually help me to floss more often, as I am not a fan of the act of flossing- but feel better about it with the added ease that product gives.</li>
            <li> I think that this Reach Total Care floss works quite well in getting in between my teeth and doing its jobs of cleaning out any gunk. The floss string is different than other kind that I&#x27;ve tried-this has a thicker string. I think, in a way, it works better than a thin string in getting anything in between your teeth. Plus it doesn&#x27;t shred easy so it can last you for your whole flossing job. The taste is pretty good as well-it doesn&#x27;t have a bad aftertaste or one that&#x27;s overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I gave the floss four stars is that I really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the whitening of my teeth. Maybe by the end of the roll, I&#x27;ll be able to tell but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. But overall, it&#x27;s still a pretty good dental floss.</li>
            <li> Some floss tends to split, or shred, and I find that really annoying.  This one does not do that, which is a big plus.  The mint taste (quite distinct) makes it more pleasant to use than most.  As for the whitening effect, I&#x27;m sure it does help to whiten the edges of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem I had with this product was the elasticity.  I found it just awkward and difficult to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get into the habit of flossing - and we all should - then it&#x27;s important that you find a product that you are happy with.  So, give this a try and see if you like its texture and elasticity.  I liked the former but not the latter.</li>
            <li> I have used this floss once a day for 3 weeks and no extra whitening compared to regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just your standard tape floss with mint and maybe it feels a bit more plastic than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy for basic floss tape function and not to whiten in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great floss, but poor dispenser design mars the total product.  Get this floss in the 90 length packaging if it is available.  The spool was binding in the case, making it very hard to pull the floss.  The floss was cutting down into the spool, instead of reeling out.  It worked better when I held the case by the thin sides, instead of pressing it in the middle of the flat sides.  I only bought the 30 length because the 90 was not available at the time.  I would avoid this 30 length packaging.</li>
            <li> The best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. Not to be confused with Reach Total Care Listerine, which is stringy and ineffective. This floss is wide, slips into place like Glide, but unlike Glide, has grooved surfaces that really scour teeth. I had been using excellent CVS Advanced Fiber floss (terrible name), but it was discontinued. This is better, and I hope Reach keeps it. Glad to order a half-dozen here that arrived quickly as promised.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as specified in my order and it was exactly as I expected. I am only disappointed that the manufacturer will no longer be producing this product.</li>
            <li> This is the poorest dental floss I have purchased in a LONG time. It&#x27;s flimsy, thin, rips faster than any dental floss I have ever used. Because it&#x27;s so thin and slippery it surely doesn&#x27;t seem like it even cleans your teeth at all. As for the whitening...I don&#x27;t see how. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Best floss I have ever used. It&#x27;s flexible/stretchy and doesn&#x27;t tear or shred.</li>
            <li> What can you say about dental floss except we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and like this brand.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> There are various styles of floss out there to buy but this is our favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t shred and cleans our teeth beautifully.  Our hygienist says our teeth have been super clean since using it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 six packs of Reach Total Care Plus Whitening and only received one.  The other six pack was Reach Total Care with Listerine flavors which I don&#x27;t like.  They must have been clearing the shelves.</li>
            <li> the best floss i have ever used</li>
            <li> Best dental floss on the market!</li>
            <li> This floss is thin and it stretches.  Does not break like other floss, and cleans well without waxing your teeth.</li>
            <li> The  \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; review in my cyber-system laments that this product fails to remove stains. Flossing is preventative, not curative. I welcome the elasticity of this floss, allowing easy access to interdental spaces. This elastic version never appears in my local markets, so I have resorted to the internet. I&#x27;m glad I found it so easily at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This floss I bought on a whim, I quit smoking and my hygienist was able to remove most of the staining, but not that in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first downside is the size per price. Most floss products are 50 yards, this was 30 at the same price as the others. I knew that purchasing it and was hopeful it would work.&lt;br /&gt;The second downside was opening it the floss would not pull out. I yanked, and then the whole roll broke free from its package and went flying. I was able to restring it properly and get it working. Opening floss should not be that hard(-1 star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening between the teeth I&#x27;ll have to work with it more time. I did not add/subtract any stars due to whitening/lack of because I just dont know yet.&lt;br /&gt;This floss is wide, but smooth and very good for people with really tight gaps between teeth. My teeth are tight and break most flosses. This seems better than my usual tiny threadlike floss... But its possible this floss is too smooth and doesnt clean much(-1)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels more like a plastic/rubber base than a cloth base, and stretches like rubber. Makes me wonder about actual product.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss on the market.</li>
            <li> I really like this floss and have used only this kind for a couple of years. It slides between teeth easily and feels like is cleans a larger area than a finer floss, but is not as big as a dental tape. It is a little stretchy which seems to help it slide.  The two stores that carry this product where I live have apparently discontinued selling it, so I ordered from Amazon. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> best floss - if you don&#x27;t have large spaces between your teeth (or even if you do) this is the best</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for years but lately have not been able to find it in local retail stores.  I like it because it seems a little &amp;#34;stretchy&amp;#34;.  I was delighted as a new customer on Amazon to easily find it and procure a large supply at a reasonable per-item price.  When I can&#x27;t find a product I like at local retail stores any longer, I am always worried that it is no longer in production, so finding this was a relief!</li>
            <li> I like that it is stretchy and you can grip it without slipping</li>
            <li> Received it promptly.  Have resorted to on line order of this product as my usual local sources have discontinued it for some reason....their loss.  Prefer this brand and type as it does not break easily, is not slippery on the fingers, and does an excellent job of cleaning.  Not sure that it does anything toward whitening as the package claims.</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever!  Would never use anything else, unless I did have this on hand.</li>
            <li> Really like this floss--it&#x27;s slightly stretchy and really traps the food.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite kind of floss, but it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores here, so I got the brilliant idea of ordering it from Amazon.  Voila&#x27;, I now have enough packages of that great floss to last me for awhile.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  This was an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> The product works as expected as I have been using it for several years.  It&#x27;s now hard to find in the corner drug stores, but my dental hygienist likes it and so do I.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the space between the teeth don&#x27;t whiten up enough with toothpaste alone. This particular brand is difficult for me to find locally, but I bought it here and can see a difference quickly. Now my husband is using it. Glad I bought the set of six!</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for years.  It is hard to find locally, so was happy to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> best denal floss  best price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Total Care Floss for the past couple of years and really like the way It gets in between my teeth to get out what brushing leaves behind.  The biggest plus for this floss as compared to other brands is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t easily break.  I really disliked the way many of the other floss products I&#x27;d tried broke off during my flossing.  The Reach product has, on occasion, broke, but very infrequently so I still want to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> A very easy floss to use!  I am a regular user!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stuck in teeth. Love this brand and find it to be better than most others.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss she loves</li>
            <li> Best floss for those with tight contact between teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the other flosses on the market....this is the ONLY variety that doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth with the tightest contact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the bomb!  Only floss I will use.  Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great. better than the glide stuff that you can&#x27;t even keep on your finger. will buy more of this soon.</li>
            <li> The elasticity and strength of this floss is far more pleasing than I expected.  My teeth are pretty tight together, which makes it hard to find floss that doesn&#x27;t fray or break.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever actually liked to floss... Highly recommend for anyone whose teeth are close together.  FYI, you can buy a single unit at Target to try it out.</li>
            <li> Reach total care is the best floss and I can&#x27;t always find it in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market in my opinion</li>
