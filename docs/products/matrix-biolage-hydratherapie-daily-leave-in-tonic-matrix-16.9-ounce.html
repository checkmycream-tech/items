            <li>This is a great product for light conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I always buy this and have been satisfied with it for many years.</li>
            <li>Hair is softer and curls are more defined since using this priciest and the shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was looking for some static control which this product works a bit</li>
            <li>I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The price was better but shipping was not so cost was a wash.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It adds volume and conditions my hair to the best possible appearance.</li>

            <li>Use this product every day, makes my hair shiny, no winter frizzies, easy to comb hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used such a great hair product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll primarily use it for hydration.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it the same as always, great detangler and leave in-conditioner.</li>
            <li>The miraculous detangling and moisturizing has changed, and I can&#x27;t even tell if any of the unique benefits remain whatsoever.</li>

            <li>A fee apprised with this gives my v hair as close to an unwashed feel as possible, and I am clean!</li>
            <li>Used on my long hair I can brush right thru after washing.</li>
            <li>You still get some moisture, but I&#x27;m afraid you also get a new smell, not quite so pleasant.</li>
            <li>By the way he uses it for dry hair and said it really helps.</li>
            <li>Because you need to use two hands it is harder to direct the spray to a particular area.</li>
            <li>Makes combing out wet hair much easier.</li>
            <li>works well on my long wavy curly hair and hair is still soft.  </li>

            <li> I use this product at night before bed.  It is a great leave-in conditioner.  It is light, but really does the job.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in stores anymore. I have tried other sprays that can be left in the hair and they all seem to make my hair greasy. I like this product the best.

            <li> This is a great product.  I use it right after I shower and I just need to get my hair under control.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry curly hair. Hair is softer and curls are more defined since using this priciest and the shampoo/ conditioner. My only gripe is that because the bottle is so big it is awkward to spray the bottle resulting in overspray. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have went through several bottles of this now and so have the people I told about it. I love Biolage products and this one is no different. Makes hair easier to comb through. You get what you pay for with Biolage. The bottle was much larger than I was anticipating so that was nice as well!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and without frizz.  Use it daily</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great detangler.</li>

            <li> This leave-in conditioner is the one I have to have--I&#x27;ve tried several and perhaps there is something else out there, but I can&#x27;t say. The price was better but shipping was not so cost was a wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years!  It arrived quickly and it the same as always, great detangler and leave in-conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband is the one who uses this every day. Hard to find and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon. By the way he uses it for dry hair and said it really helps.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my waist and no split ends. I use this on my wet hair every morning before bunning up (my daily look) my hair for work. It detangles and conditions. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  Could not find it in any of the beauty supply stores.  Good price for the size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for my fine thinning hair. It adds volume and conditions my hair to the best possible appearance.</li>
