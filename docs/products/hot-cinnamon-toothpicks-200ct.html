            <li>Loved them.</li>

            <li>But I love them!</li>
            <li>Something nice flavored to suck on.</li>
            <li>I purchased my own oil and am making them again just as well as I did in my teens.</li>
            <li>that picture is not how many you get, but still good</li>
            <li>I think I may be somewhat spoiled because I have always made my own cinnamon toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Awesome toothpicks for that person who has a craving for cinnamon toothpicks (such as I) and are really good and spicy.</li>
            <li>They taste great, are just the right amount of cinnamon heat.  </li>
            <li>very nice and hot , will be buying more soon</li>
            <li>He was greatly satisfied on Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>We love these.  </li>
            <li>I kinda would recommend, but a lot of the time I had to put more than one  in at a time for punch.</li>
            <li>Better than some</li>
            <li>This cinnamon is HOTTER than most.  </li>
            <li>(And I LOVE spicy things..</li>
            <li>Delicious!  Would definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>and they were pretty good</li>
            <li>They have a nice fireball like taste, though the flavor quickly fades over 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try taking the easy route..</li>
            <li>Cinnamon is too strong.  </li>
            <li>they are that strong.</li>
            <li>If you have an oral fixation or want to use these to help quit smoking or something, I would look for something a bit more mild.  </li>
            <li>My dad, when he was a child used to enjoy these all the time.</li>
            <li>I really need to make my own.  </li>
            <li>My son loved them and they really arent that hot.</li>
            <li>Have great flavor that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to making my own!</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and even though there was delivery confirmation, they were super fantastic about sending out a replacement shipment.  </li>
            <li>Flavor lasts a while and what&#x27;s really cool is it comes in a resealable bag</li>
            <li>Bought these as a gift because they couldn&#x27;t find any locally and they loved them</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC experience, definitely worth your time.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i needed and it came at a great price considering the quality of the flavor, the quality of the actual wood itself and the quick shipping (I ordered on a Sunday and it came that Tuesday afternoon).</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>These were shipped quickly by the seller and for that I would rate a 10</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t ever recall them being this hot!</li>
            <li>These are amazing and the taste is constant.</li>
            <li>Standard toothpicks in a nice, resealable pouch.  </li>
            <li>It was fun to show my kids what kids use to sell at our school when we were growing up.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the toothpicks I used when I was in elementary school.  </li>
            <li>and I think I tossed the first one after about an hour</li>
            <li>Great long lasting flavor</li>
            <li>, this is more along the lines of the oil I purchased way back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are hot.  </li>
            <li>My husband says they are too hot for him.  </li>
            <li>First impression.</li>
            <li>The first one I used set me on fire.</li>
            <li>These are great tasting and last a long time!</li>
            <li>the cinnamon is so strong at first that you will have to suck on the entire pick for a bit or else</li>
            <li>to strong for constant use</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that when the flavor does run out, simply flip the toothpick around and you have an entire new experience.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that these would be like the cinnamon sticks I found on a vacation that last for an hour or more, with each bite down releasing more flavor.  </li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll release so much flavor you&#x27;ll kill some tastebuds.</li>
            <li>I truly appreciate that as I&#x27;ve never had a lost delivery and customer service means so much.  </li>
            <li>When the package arrived (very promptly after my order, I might add)</li>
            <li>A little strong at first but then not so much</li>
            <li>I quickly proceeded to open it and put one in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These do exactly as they say, they&#x27;re regular cinnamon tooth picks, not too hot</li>
            <li>Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They were probably the other brand &amp;#34;hotlix&amp;#34; but I chose these because they have more natural flavor.</li>
            <li>Flavor is nice and strong (and hot) overall, although there&#x27;s an occasional weak one in the pack.  </li>
            <li>The actual toothpicks seem to be of low quality though, as they splinter/shred pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>These were just ok, and had a bit more of an artificial flavor to me.</li>
            <li>Just as I remembered from my old high school days, maybe hotter ðŸ˜€.</li>
            <li>However, be careful, as they will and have have torched my taste buds to where I can&#x27;t taste right for about a week when I go on a real binge with them...</li>
            <li>They have a really strong taste and last a long time.</li>
            <li>You have some lingering burn though at 20 minutes you&#x27;re left with little more than a hint of cinnamon that makes you reach for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I am a cinnamon aficionado and have been since I was buying cinnamon oil way back in the day when you needed to get the real stuff from a pharmacy with an ID.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Still these are good toothpicks if you can handle the burning (they do burn your lips pretty bad).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive my first shipment due to a lost package.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re still nice toothpicks and nostalgic</li>
            <li>I tend to chew down on them and they held up really well while still having loads of favor.</li>
            <li>These are great to use after a meal, and they are so much better than the usual boring &amp;#34;taste-less&amp;#34; tooth picks.</li>

            <li> Long lasting flavor</li>
            <li> Not the flavor intensity I was expecting based on other reviews, pretty weak actually, almost as if the process was rushed and the toothpicks did not soak long enough.  </li>
            <li> It does take a long time for the toothpicks to sit in the cinnamon oil before they take on a sufficient flavor/intensity, so</li>
            <li> Soak them longer and let them air dry on an non porous surface.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to hold my lips over them too long.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bite into the center of the toothpick either</li>
            <li> They are the same size as an ordinary toothpick, and the flavor lasts forever.</li>
            <li> wished it can in other flavors like mint, strawberries,grapes</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical going into this purchase, but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I made these as a kid in middle school and these did not have hardly any taste except for wood.  </li>
            <li> hardly any cinnamon taste at all.</li>
            <li> Sadly I was let down.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s faint.</li>
            <li> Some toothpicks were lacking and had a mediocre amount.</li>
            <li> BTW, they are made with cinnamon oil but also with artificial flavors.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Something nice flavored to suck on. A little strong at first but then not so much</li>
            <li> soooo good spicy cinnamon. yummmmmy</li>
            <li> to strong for constant use</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are great. They are the same size as an ordinary toothpick, and the flavor lasts forever. A bit of warning however ad the cinnamon is so strong at first that you will have to suck on the entire pick for a bit or else your lips will be burnt by the strength of the flavor.  Don&#x27;t bite into the center of the toothpick either or you&#x27;ll release so much flavor you&#x27;ll kill some tastebuds.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend to help him quit his dip habit. He loves the flavor and its helping. Healthier and cheaper than dip!!  Ordered more!</li>
            <li> Cinnamon is too strong.  It burns and then it is gone.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that these would be like the cinnamon sticks I found on a vacation that last for an hour or more, with each bite down releasing more flavor.  Sadly I was let down.  They have a nice fireball like taste, though the flavor quickly fades over 5-10 minutes.  You have some lingering burn though at 20 minutes you&#x27;re left with little more than a hint of cinnamon that makes you reach for a new one.  I guess that&#x27;s why they come in 200 ct packs.</li>
            <li> very nice and hot , will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> When I was a kid these were cheaper and a novelty item.  These brought back that same flavor.  Their quality is good and I think I tossed the first one after about an hour so the flavor lasted.  Shipping was quick.  They came in one resealable bag rather than the pictured multiple bags.</li>
            <li> They are great. You have to be able to handle their kick! My son loved them and they really arent that hot.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpicks for that person who has a craving for cinnamon toothpicks (such as I) and are really good and spicy. Flavor lasts a while and what&#x27;s really cool is it comes in a resealable bag but I also use a toothpick case that I use when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>

            <li> wished it can in other flavors like mint, strawberries,grapes</li>
            <li> My dad, when he was a child used to enjoy these all the time. He came to me one day, distressed that he could find Cinnamon Toothpicks no where on the internet. I knew where to go. He was greatly satisfied on Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Great flavor. Just what I was looming for.</li>
            <li> it tastes just like a regular toothpick. hardly any cinnamon taste at all. I would not buy them if you gave me a thousand for the same price</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift because they couldn&#x27;t find any locally and they loved them</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  They taste great, are just the right amount of cinnamon heat.  Standard toothpicks in a nice, resealable pouch.  I didn&#x27;t receive my first shipment due to a lost package.  I contacted the seller and even though there was delivery confirmation, they were super fantastic about sending out a replacement shipment.  I truly appreciate that as I&#x27;ve never had a lost delivery and customer service means so much.  Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Loved them. Have great flavor that lasted a long time. I tend to chew down on them and they held up really well while still having loads of favor. Trying to quit smoking and these toothpicks gives me something to put in my mouth and the flavor helps cut the need to smoke.</li>
            <li> I made these as a kid in middle school and these did not have hardly any taste except for wood.  Soak them longer and let them air dry on an non porous surface. These were shipped quickly by the seller and for that I would rate a 10 however the product is not something I would purchase again nor recommend.  I purchased my own oil and am making them again just as well as I did in my teens.</li>
            <li> These are great! Just as I remembered from my old high school days, maybe hotter ðŸ˜€.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical going into this purchase, but it was definitely worth it. When the package arrived (very promptly after my order, I might add) I quickly proceeded to open it and put one in my mouth. The taste was delicious. The burn on your lips that people speak of only occurs for about 5-15 seconds (give or take based on your spicy tolerance) the spiciness lasts for about 10 minutes, again give or take based on tolerance, but the flavor, however, lasts surprisingly long...about 45 minutes to an hour for me. Another good thing is that when the flavor does run out, simply flip the toothpick around and you have an entire new experience. I use these in replacement of gum as I work from home and like to keep some part of my body moving. This is exactly what i needed and it came at a great price considering the quality of the flavor, the quality of the actual wood itself and the quick shipping (I ordered on a Sunday and it came that Tuesday afternoon). FANTASTIC experience, definitely worth your time.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again.  Great long lasting flavor</li>
            <li> that picture is not how many you get, but still good</li>
            <li> Great product. Long lasting flavor</li>
            <li> These do exactly as they say, they&#x27;re regular cinnamon tooth picks, not too hot but you can taste the cinnamon but sometimes it&#x27;s faint. Still great though!</li>
            <li> These taste really good. Flavor is nice and strong (and hot) overall, although there&#x27;s an occasional weak one in the pack.  The actual toothpicks seem to be of low quality though, as they splinter/shred pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> We love these.  Very potent and the flavor lasts.  Just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Everyone i offered them to loved them!</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are great! They have a really strong taste and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The flavor was spot on, the intensity was not. Some toothpicks were lacking and had a mediocre amount. Packaging &amp; delivery were sufficient. I kinda would recommend, but a lot of the time I had to put more than one  in at a time for punch.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my officemate who is quitting smoking. She loves them, they smell very strong and taste good she says. She would recommend.</li>
            <li> great service...tasty product</li>
            <li> Not the flavor intensity I was expecting based on other reviews, pretty weak actually, almost as if the process was rushed and the toothpicks did not soak long enough.  Better than some I have bought before, but definitely not what I was looking for.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I think I may be somewhat spoiled because I have always made my own cinnamon toothpicks. It does take a long time for the toothpicks to sit in the cinnamon oil before they take on a sufficient flavor/intensity, so I thought I&#x27;d try taking the easy route.. These were just ok, and had a bit more of an artificial flavor to me. I guess it&#x27;s back to making my own! These would do in a pinch though.</li>
            <li> These are great to use after a meal, and they are so much better than the usual boring &amp;#34;taste-less&amp;#34; tooth picks.</li>
            <li> I am a cinnamon snob.  I am a cinnamon aficionado and have been since I was buying cinnamon oil way back in the day when you needed to get the real stuff from a pharmacy with an ID.  I&#x27;m so hooked on cinnamon that I used to make cinnamon paper out of school paper to suck on and chew throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say all of that to say this:  These picks are the BEST I&#x27;ve ever come across for flavor and consistency when it comes to heat.  This cinnamon is HOTTER than most.  Don&#x27;t think Jolly Rancher Fire cinnamon, this is more along the lines of the oil I purchased way back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can blow through 50 picks a day and can tell you these are the best.  However, be careful, as they will and have have torched my taste buds to where I can&#x27;t taste right for about a week when I go on a real binge with them...they are that strong.</li>
            <li> They were really good.  It was fun to show my kids what kids use to sell at our school when we were growing up.</li>
            <li> These are addicting but beware you CAN get burned lips from these.  If you have an oral fixation or want to use these to help quit smoking or something, I would look for something a bit more mild.  (And I LOVE spicy things.. so that is not the issue)&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t expect to use these in a toothpick dispenser.  They gummed up and destroyed a toothpick dispenser I had.&lt;br /&gt;They are a good novelty toothpick though, and if you like cinnamon, they are delicious.</li>
            <li> They delivered what I wanted. Cinnamon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are great.  Reminds me of the toothpicks I used when I was in elementary school.  It takes away the urge I have to snack in the evenings.  They are hot.  I have to be careful not to hold my lips over them too long.  My husband says they are too hot for him.  But I love them!</li>
            <li> My mom always gave me some cinnamon toothpicks when I was a kid and they were pretty good but I don&#x27;t ever recall them being this hot! They were probably the other brand &amp;#34;hotlix&amp;#34; but I chose these because they have more natural flavor. Still these are good toothpicks if you can handle the burning (they do burn your lips pretty bad). I wouldn&#x27;t regret this purchase they&#x27;re still nice toothpicks and nostalgic</li>
            <li> Wow. First impression. I just got these today. The first one I used set me on fire. These are amazing and the taste is constant. If you&#x27;re looking for flavored toothpicks, get these.</li>
            <li> There were reviews of these talking about how they burned lips and caused devastation.  Not in my experience.  When I get a cinnamon craving it takes me 3-4 of these to satisfy it.  I really need to make my own.  BTW, they are made with cinnamon oil but also with artificial flavors.</li>
            <li> These are great tasting and last a long time!</li>
            <li> Delicious!  Would definitely purchase again.  Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like when I was a kid</li>
            <li> good value, good flavor</li>
    </ol>
