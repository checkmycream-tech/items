    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The &amp;quot;sideburn/neck attachment is awesome too.</li>
            <li>in all, this groomer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>It is, however, the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for trimming mustache, beard, and nose/ear hair.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the service.</li>
            <li>It was the best $15 razor/trimmer I ever bought!</li>
            <li>/&gt;By comparison, the Panasonic is a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works great for him</li>
            <li>Great just as a &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I&#x27;m relatively happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it has worked great.</li>
            <li>If you have a place to display it, it looks great and is functional.</li>
            <li>Upon using the Groomer, I was fairly happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Groomer for 6 months now, and I&#x27;m happy with the dependable results.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the clippers were very handy, they cut close.  </li>
            <li>The attachments that come with the set aren&#x27;t very effective though.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a good value for the money in and of itself.</li>
            <li>Battery life was good when I used it.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it looked</li>
            <li>I liked the size, looks, and feel of it.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job for touching up around the ears, etc.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with his new shaver.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is cheap and would be a good deal except the two plastic screens that are used to set the hair length</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use and all of the attachments work just fine!</li>
            <li>If you have a moustache or beard you are trying to maintain, you need to invest in something more robust.</li>
            <li>Glad to know</li>
            <li>I echo many of people&#x27;s thoughts on this piece of garbage.  </li>
            <li>so I feel I got much more than what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I took it to a remington store and they replaced it, no questions asked..the replacement wasn&#x27;t much better...</li>
            <li>Trimming was &#x27;acceptable&#x27; though my 9.00 ConAir trimmed better.</li>
            <li>Bought a Norelco, much better.</li>
            <li>What I love about this unit is HOW LIGHT IT IS!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t count on it doing much more than that.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great deal at the time, but you live</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Powerful,fast,safe,fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It tips over too easily.  </li>
            <li>It would be a 5 star, if the attachments didn&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
            <li>The length attachments work just fine</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to [spend a lot] on a nice one, so I got this one for [a reasonable price].  </li>
            <li>The two plastic attachments regulating the length of the trim are extremely cheap and ineffective--if you are trying to trim a beard you will have to go over and over it for 20 minutes to get the trim.  </li>
            <li>would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a cheap groomer to trim your sideburns with nosehair clippers in the bargain.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s cheap plastic, but what isn&#x27;t these days?  </li>
            <li>Worth what you pay for, but adjustable trim guides promise more than they can deliver.</li>
            <li>stand is way too light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth more than what you pay.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a lot given the cheap price.</li>
            <li>It is an unbelievably cheap piece.  </li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers are complaining about the cheap and shabby construction and operation of the Groomer; but, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>You will of course have to use a full blown razor if you want a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Though cheaply constructed, it worked OK for almost a year and did a reasonably satisfactory job as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and I sure did not pay much for these</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for a backup, although that may not be true soon if the battery dies from lack of use.</li>
            <li>Charging was funny, but easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I have a goatee, and the Groomer adequately trimmed and shaped my goatee.  </li>
            <li>lucky found one online 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It comes with 2 adjustable length attachments so you can trim rite down to skin or adjust it to a length suitable to do the sides of your head for a nice cleancut appearance.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these when they were on a close out sale several years ago and VERY glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The product comes with two clip-on adjusting guards, which I found very consistent trim after trim, so one can cut one&#x27;s body hair to the desired closeness.  </li>
            <li>The cost of this product is under $15.00, and at this price level, one simply cannot expect the high quality that some reviewers are demanding; nonetheless, I have been happy with the results of the Groomer.  </li>
            <li>Remington has always been a good household name and while this was my first attempt at a personal groomer - I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lots of fun to use as well.</li>
            <li>I dropped it once from a high shelf and it survived just fine.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a basic hair trimmer for your ear, nose, and just a trimmer for general body hair, this is good cheap product.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only positive thing I can say for the PG-200</li>
            <li>The bare trimmers are OK for neatening edges.  </li>
            <li>Great product, trims small areas well.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased had problems charging right away..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still on the market, just in case this old faithful ever dies on me, so I can replace it easily.</li>
            <li>This Remington (be sure to get the PG200 model) trimmer however zipped right through my 3 month beard in no time flat and not once did it pinch!</li>
            <li>But overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>; well... finally got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t charge any more within 14 months ...</li>
            <li>broke one guide in the first year.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t hold well enough to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>and though I agree with the one reviewer that the product does feel a bit light and could be flimsy if you are not careful, I have found that this thing does EVERYTHING you ask it to within reason.</li>
            <li>The entire unit is made of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>My only regret was not purchasing every one that the store had on sale when I got these to since they are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Remington wants $3.00 plus shipping for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>No broken clips, no charging problems and all of the attachments that you need.</li>
            <li>I should note that the version of this razor I have has a silver chrome like button which is slightly different from the satin one pictured and mine is also oil free.</li>
            <li>and then they are good for intermittent use for about a week at least.  </li>
            <li>It looks decent but boy is that deceiving.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was a decent product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this item HIGHLY.</li>
            <li>What an ingenious little thing it is.</li>
            <li>The microscreen attachment worked very well the one time I used it, but given how cheaply the entire unit is I wonder how long it would hold up.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this new. &lt;BR</li>
            <li>So now I would be 6.00 into a shaver I could buy on ebay/amazon brand new for under 15.00.  </li>
            <li>Since this identical item is available from multiple manufacturers it is obviously a generic import.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this thing, spend a little more, it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was my first blade got lost.  </li>
            <li>This little unit has lasted me over 2 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Two week trips with a full charge are no problem at all, actually lasts for several months!</li>
            <li>I have had this for about 6 months and overall this is a shabby machine, suitable for minor trimming (i.e., sideburns, minor cleanup) but ill-equipped to handle heavy-duty stuff like moustaches and beards.  </li>
            <li>Though it is true that if you do not prepare your beard first it will take several passes to trim your beard, I have to say though that the other reviewer was NOT using his correctly!</li>
            <li>Attachments are as such not of much use.</li>
            <li>I opened package of the second one about a year ago and it was ready to go out of the box without charging.  </li>
            <li>And now that I&#x27;ve had it for about one year, it has completely stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the Groomer&#x27;s &#x27;buzz&#x27; is loud, but not deafening.  </li>
            <li>As for the ear/nose attachment itself, it is much faster than any other available, by far, and the design allows me to get into the tight areas with ease.</li>
            <li>I also had to go over and over tough spots many times...</li>
            <li>Lack of customer service and cheaply made and hard to find accessories would definitely not warrant purchasing this item!!  </li>
            <li>Product quality is extremely poor; I do not believe it would be possible to create a more cheaply made or poorly designed product.</li>
            <li>is it made me appreciate my new [other brand].</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not much use as a general purpose razor, but I never expected it to be; it&#x27;s just a pinch-hitter in that area.  </li>

            <li> I seldom need to recharge it, very long lasting.</li>
            <li> and it was a drag because the blades would pinch because it would struggle with my coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was using an old heavy cordless trimmer by Conair with which the battery was dying</li>
            <li> And now after 5 years it is finally dulled, wish my other one would have never got lost.  </li>
            <li> got one of these less than six months before it totally stopped recharging and died.  </li>
            <li> It made me finally act on my utter dissatisfaction with this Remington product (I&#x27;ll buy no more from Remington.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it got rid of the little &amp;quot;stray&amp;quot; nose nubs rite at the tip of the nostrils which can only be trimmed down to a nub by any basic ear/nosehair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels about like the size and weight of a wet razor.</li>
            <li> The vibration of the Groomer is about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only variations that I&#x27;ve had with \\&quot;speed\\&quot; have been due to a hairs trapped in the cutters.</li>
            <li> The motor is weak and definitely takes multiple passes to cut.</li>
            <li> For the record, I am very careful with all of my belongings.</li>
            <li> And trying to purchase replacement parts (like the cheap combs) is almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the cheap plastic that others complained about, I hate the fact that the piece you need to frequently move was built with replacement in mind.  </li>
            <li> Used it for only mustache, but  I shave and trim at least 2 to 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> The charger base is also as per the cheap cost!</li>
            <li> Plus it does all the other areas on my head!</li>
            <li> This machine is not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Lets start with the little micro foil attachment.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the price!</li>
            <li> The motor on this thing is so weak that it would actually stop when I touched it to my beard.  </li>
            <li> The plastic that attaches is so poorly constructed that you have to be extremely careful with them to get a couple weeks of use - even then they will break with extremely careful use.  </li>
            <li> Often my hairs were half-cut and left broken.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your money, trust me.</li>
            <li> Thicker beards will have trouble.</li>
            <li> Save your money rather than waste it as I did.</li>
            <li> Then it became erratic, running at slow speed despite recharging, slow enough to &amp;quot;bite.&amp;quot</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear some other reviewers have had bad experiences with this product, but I love mine.  </li>
            <li> and this is no more noisy than they were.</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with the usual beard comb to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money - go with a Norelco!</li>
            <li> Most annoying, the stand is completely useless, the accessories fall out of it constantly--basic physics was overlooked</li>
            <li> I was astonished to find it cleanly and effortlessly got rid of those little annoying hairs between my ears and my sideburns which even the barber can never get to!</li>
            <li> For the price-level, the Remington PG-200 is hard to beat.</li>

            <li> The guards are made of ..., thin plastic and can not hold up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I thought that the clippers were very handy, they cut close.  I&#x27;ve had them for a year now and they haven&#x27;t needed sharpening yet.  The attachments that come with the set aren&#x27;t very effective though.  The clippers stay charged for quite a while, I usually only charge them for an hour and then they are good for intermittent use for about a week at least.  The charger for the clipper is supposed to hold all the attachments, but its arrange in a way that makes putting all of the attachments in it difficult.  But overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> also would like to register for the $100,00 giveaway IV</li>
            <li> It is an expensive nose trimmer. The rest of the functions are substandard.</li>
            <li> This one deserves ZERO stars.  It looks decent but boy is that deceiving.  This product is a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got one of these less than six months before it totally stopped recharging and died.  In a way that was a blessing.  It made me finally act on my utter dissatisfaction with this Remington product (I&#x27;ll buy no more from Remington.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was slow, underpowered, ineffective, too small and awkward to use, uncomfortable on my face and produced poor results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with the Panasonic ER206K.  The difference is like night and day.  Click above on SEE ALL MY REVIEWS for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, the Panasonic is a joy to use.  Unlike my ill-advised spur-of-moment purchase of the Remington, I did my homework on Amazon before purchasing the Panasonic ER206K.</li>
            <li> I purchased this same item about 2 years ago for my husband.  One of the pieces recently broke and he insisted that I order him exacly the same shaver again.  He was lost without it.  Works great for him and he uses it several times a week.  He is very happy with his new shaver.</li>
            <li> Though cheaply constructed, it worked OK for almost a year and did a reasonably satisfactory job as a beard trimmer.  Then it became erratic, running at slow speed despite recharging, slow enough to &amp;quot;bite.&amp;quot;  I am replacing it with a Norelco 7500.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is cheap and would be a good deal except the two plastic screens that are used to set the hair length both broke immediately.  As it seems impossible to get spare parts this makes the machine useless.  It also has bad vibrations and does a ragged job of cutting.  It holds a charge well, but can only charge when placed in its stand.  If you are in the middle of trimming and run out of charge you then have to put the machine in its cradle and walk away until it recharges as there is no provision to use it while plugged in.  This machine is not worth the trouble.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic hair trimmer for your ear, nose, and just a trimmer for general body hair, this is good cheap product. Attachments are as such not of much use. The charger base is also as per the cheap cost! &lt;BR&gt;Definitely at this price dont expect it to be a real personal &amp;quot;grommer&amp;quot;. Great just as a &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> The attachments broke after a weeks use.  The plastic that attaches is so poorly constructed that you have to be extremely careful with them to get a couple weeks of use - even then they will break with extremely careful use.  I&#x27;m looking for something else to replace it.  I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t skimp on a beard trimmer. I didn&#x27;t want to [spend a lot] on a nice one, so I got this one for [a reasonable price].  The plastic length guards broke almost immediately, and it&#x27;s quite difficult to buy replacements. &lt;BR&gt;Often my hairs were half-cut and left broken. I also had to go over and over tough spots many times...&lt;BR&gt;Honestly the only positive thing I can say for the PG-200 is it made me appreciate my new [other brand].</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 6 months and overall this is a shabby machine, suitable for minor trimming (i.e., sideburns, minor cleanup) but ill-equipped to handle heavy-duty stuff like moustaches and beards.  The entire unit is made of cheap plastic.  The bare trimmers are OK for neatening edges.  The two plastic attachments regulating the length of the trim are extremely cheap and ineffective--if you are trying to trim a beard you will have to go over and over it for 20 minutes to get the trim.  I never used the nose/ear-hair clippers (already have a nosehair clipper that I like).  The microscreen attachment worked very well the one time I used it, but given how cheaply the entire unit is I wonder how long it would hold up.  Most annoying, the stand is completely useless, the accessories fall out of it constantly--basic physics was overlooked here.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a cheap groomer to trim your sideburns with nosehair clippers in the bargain.  If you have a moustache or beard you are trying to maintain, you need to invest in something more robust.</li>
            <li> I purchased this new. &lt;BR&gt;I am having couple problems:&lt;BR&gt;  -  adjustable clips to clip hair at various heights snap on.&lt;BR&gt;      1-  the clips have plastic tips that broke off after couple&lt;BR&gt;          uses.&lt;BR&gt;      2-  also the clips are not adjustable to a very short  &lt;BR&gt;          height&lt;BR&gt;  -  there are 2 different heads for the device (one for clipping&lt;BR&gt;     one for ear/nose hair).  the head is set on with a 1/8 turn.&lt;BR&gt;     but after couple uses it keeps turning lose and off during &lt;BR&gt;     use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had every &amp;quot;nose,ear hair trimmer&amp;quot; in existance, and this 1 finally does what I had hoped the others would&#x27;ve done. Plus it does all the other areas on my head! Lets start with the little micro foil attachment. I was very skeptical about how it would perform. I was astonished to find it cleanly and effortlessly got rid of those little annoying hairs between my ears and my sideburns which even the barber can never get to! And it got rid of the little &amp;quot;stray&amp;quot; nose nubs rite at the tip of the nostrils which can only be trimmed down to a nub by any basic ear/nosehair trimmer. As for the ear/nose attachment itself, it is much faster than any other available, by far, and the design allows me to get into the tight areas with ease. The &amp;quot;sideburn/neck attachment is awesome too. It comes with 2 adjustable length attachments so you can trim rite down to skin or adjust it to a length suitable to do the sides of your head for a nice cleancut appearance. And it does the eyebrows without any worry about making a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this groomer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and the quality is excellent. It&#x27;s lots of fun to use as well.I&#x27;ve had every Remington,Grundig,Panasonic,Conair and others. In my quest to find the groomer that actually works the way I always hoped 1 would, my search stops here. I bought 2, just in case...&lt;br /&gt;Powerful,fast,safe,fun and easy to use. I recommend this item HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear some other reviewers have had bad experiences with this product, but I love mine.  Yeah, it&#x27;s cheap plastic, but what isn&#x27;t these days?  No, it&#x27;s not much use as a general purpose razor, but I never expected it to be; it&#x27;s just a pinch-hitter in that area.  It is, however, the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for trimming mustache, beard, and nose/ear hair.  Essential.  Never have had any problem at all keeping a charge, either.  Bargain.  Glad to know it&#x27;s still on the market, just in case this old faithful ever dies on me, so I can replace it easily.</li>
            <li> I echo many of people&#x27;s thoughts on this piece of garbage.  Just don&#x27;t waste your money, trust me.</li>
            <li> Great product, trims small areas well.</li>
            <li> Last a couple of months, probably a dozen uses, and then stopped working.  Won&#x27;t take a charge.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these when they were on a close out sale several years ago and VERY glad I did.  I used the first one trimming my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34; at least weekly for 3 years when the battery finally would no longer charge.  I opened package of the second one about a year ago and it was ready to go out of the box without charging.  My wife&#x27;s very expensive trimmer quit about six months ago and she has also been using it almost daily since.  My only regret was not purchasing every one that the store had on sale when I got these to since they are no longer available.  As another commenter said, you get what you pay for and I sure did not pay much for these so I feel I got much more than what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased had problems charging right away.. I took it to a remington store and they replaced it, no questions asked..the replacement wasn&#x27;t much better... charging mechanism and groomer don&#x27;t &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; well... finally got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t charge any more within 14 months ...For as lttle as I used it over that timeframe I consider it a DUD! NOT worth the price!</li>
            <li> The snap-on attachments broke withing a couple weeks of purchase.  The motor on this thing is so weak that it would actually stop when I touched it to my beard.  And now that I&#x27;ve had it for about one year, it has completely stopped working altogether. It has no power anymore.  It seemed like a great deal at the time, but you live and you learn I guess.  Steer clear of this thing, spend a little more, it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Worth what you pay for, but adjustable trim guides promise more than they can deliver. You have long and short (2 guides). Both slip regularly to the shortest in their adjustable range. As a result I use the longest on its shortest setting.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I broke one guide in the first year. Remington replaced it at no cost when I complained on their web site that I couldn&#x27;t order one. They are fragile. I was impressed with the service. I didn&#x27;t get an email response, I got a part in 2 days. Wow! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it almost three years, and it&#x27;s on its way out, though. The motor is weak and definitely takes multiple passes to cut. Thicker beards will have trouble. The battery is now dying and it&#x27;s not replaceble, so its time has passed. It&#x27;s good enough for a backup, although that may not be true soon if the battery dies from lack of use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stand is way too light. It tips over too easily.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth more than what you pay. That&#x27;s a lot given the cheap price. Given the price, I&#x27;m relatively happy with it. I would have given 4 stars if the guides weren&#x27;t adjustable. They really don&#x27;t hold well enough to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a good value for the money in and of itself. I&#x27;ve had mine for about six months and it has worked great. It&#x27;s the attachments that are it&#x27;s downfall. After using it about once a week for six months the clips that hold the adjustable guards to the trimmer have all broken off. The guards are made of ..., thin plastic and can not hold up.</li>
            <li> Purchased product almost immediately failed to accept charge. Product quality is extremely poor; I do not believe it would be possible to create a more cheaply made or poorly designed product. Since this identical item is available from multiple manufacturers it is obviously a generic import. Save your money rather than waste it as I did.</li>
            <li> My brother in law has one of these and loves it.  I liked the way it looked and my sister gave me one for Christmas.  Here&#x27;s my scoop: &lt;br /&gt;1.  If you have a place to display it, it looks great and is functional. If you must place it in a standard size medicine cabinet, you will be frustrated with the way all the pieces fall out of the holder with the slightest movement-which BTW if you have a shelf in your cabinet you will have to take the base out in order to remove the trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;2.  Battery life was good when I used it. &lt;br /&gt;3.  Trimming was &#x27;acceptable&#x27; though my 9.00 ConAir trimmed better. &lt;br /&gt;4.  After using it about 7 times, the comb on the trimmer broke.  It is an unbelievably cheap piece.  I don&#x27;t mind the cheap plastic that others complained about, I hate the fact that the piece you need to frequently move was built with replacement in mind.  For the record, I am very careful with all of my belongings. &lt;br /&gt;5.  Remington wants $3.00 plus shipping for a replacement.  So now I would be 6.00 into a shaver I could buy on ebay/amazon brand new for under 15.00.  I think I will move on. &lt;br /&gt;6.  I liked the size, looks, and feel of it.  I just wish it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> This is awful. It snags &amp;amp; pulls the hairs - very painful. Bought a Norelco, much better. After only two uses, this thing is back in it&#x27;s box.  The only reason I&#x27;m not returning it is just in case I need an emergency back-up trimmer.&lt;BR&gt;Not recommended!</li>
            <li> Precision instruments deserve delicate treatment. This little unit has lasted me over 2 years and still going strong. No broken clips, no charging problems and all of the attachments that you need. The only variations that I&#x27;ve had with \\&quot;speed\\&quot; have been due to a hairs trapped in the cutters. I seldom need to recharge it, very long lasting. Two week trips with a full charge are no problem at all, actually lasts for several months! I&#x27;ve had Wahl&#x27;s before and this is no more noisy than they were. I would by another one in a heart beat but I don&#x27;t treat my cutting instruments like footballs.    Also see this link http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Products-Company-Personal-Titanium/dp/B000OXGT7Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1227880917&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for about 1 week and though I agree with the one reviewer that the product does feel a bit light and could be flimsy if you are not careful, I have found that this thing does EVERYTHING you ask it to within reason. I was using an old heavy cordless trimmer by Conair with which the battery was dying and it was a drag because the blades would pinch because it would struggle with my coarse facial hair. This Remington (be sure to get the PG200 model) trimmer however zipped right through my 3 month beard in no time flat and not once did it pinch! I was amazed!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Though it is true that if you do not prepare your beard first it will take several passes to trim your beard, I have to say though that the other reviewer was NOT using his correctly! This trimmer comes with the usual beard comb to use. Any trimmer will take several passes if you don&#x27;t prepare your beard though! The length attachments work just fine too.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;flimsy&amp;quot; feeling exterior is not all bad. I dropped it once from a high shelf and it survived just fine. What I love about this unit is HOW LIGHT IT IS! It is very comfortable to use and all of the attachments work just fine! It feels about like the size and weight of a wet razor. What an ingenious little thing it is. It was the best $15 razor/trimmer I ever bought! You will of course have to use a full blown razor if you want a smooth shave. The mini foil shaver is for trim only! I give this trimmer an A+ for price and usablity!&lt;br /&gt;-&#x3D;edit&#x3D;- I should note that the version of this razor I have has a silver chrome like button which is slightly different from the satin one pictured and mine is also oil free. It no longer requires oiling. It could be that Remington has improved on this model from last year.</li>
            <li> I actually went online to look for an attachment replacement and found this site where it seems to happen to everybody else. It would be a 5 star, if the attachments didn&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
            <li> Remington has always been a good household name and while this was my first attempt at a personal groomer - I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable combs are cheap and were broken within a couple uses - just by putting them on they were weakend.  The shaver tends to pull longer hairs before it cuts.  And trying to purchase replacement parts (like the cheap combs) is almost impossible.  I&#x27;ve searched the web and stores and can&#x27;t find anyone who sells just accessories for this groomer. &lt;br /&gt;Even after e-mailing Remington to ask where I can get replacements, they never responded.  Lack of customer service and cheaply made and hard to find accessories would definitely not warrant purchasing this item!!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money - go with a Norelco!</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers are complaining about the cheap and shabby construction and operation of the Groomer; but, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  The Groomer does not have high-quality designs and technology, plus the unit, both the base and the Groomer itself, are plastic.  Additionally, the Groomer&#x27;s &#x27;buzz&#x27; is loud, but not deafening.  The vibration of the Groomer is about what I expected.  I purchased this Groomer at a local mass merchant.  Upon using the Groomer, I was fairly happy with the results.  I have a goatee, and the Groomer adequately trimmed and shaped my goatee.  The product comes with two clip-on adjusting guards, which I found very consistent trim after trim, so one can cut one&#x27;s body hair to the desired closeness.  Additionally, the unit comes with a nose/ear trimmer (which I have never used) and a foil shaver (again, I have never used; do not need it).  Bottom Line:  I have been using the Groomer for 6 months now, and I&#x27;m happy with the dependable results.  The cost of this product is under $15.00, and at this price level, one simply cannot expect the high quality that some reviewers are demanding; nonetheless, I have been happy with the results of the Groomer.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, functional, and reliable tool to meet your trimming/grooming needs, I would go with the Remington PG-200.  For the price-level, the Remington PG-200 is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> WTH?  I can not believe all the negative reviews.  Unfortunally they quit making these and the parts.  I have had mine for over 7 years that I can remember.  Charging, I could go weeks without charging it.  Used it for only mustache, but  I shave and trim at least 2 to 3 times a week.  The only problem I had was my first blade got lost.  Got lucky found one online 5 years ago.  And now after 5 years it is finally dulled, wish my other one would have never got lost.  Charging was funny, but easy to figure out.  you just didn&#x27;t bump it cause it just sat in there and let it set for 24 hours and you knew it was charged the next day.  Am now looking for another blade for it</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer for a couple years. Does a good job for touching up around the ears, etc. Don&#x27;t count on it doing much more than that.</li>
