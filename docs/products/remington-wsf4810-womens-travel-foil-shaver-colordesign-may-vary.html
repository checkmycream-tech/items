            <li>It&#x27;s good in a pinch for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job.  </li>

            <li>I thought this would be a good solution for</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>If what you want is an efficient, effective, non-painful way to quickly shave your legs, this is an awesome razor.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I love it!</li>
            <li>Its really cute and girly yet does the job!</li>
            <li>This is probably my 5th Remington shaver and I love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>The best part: it&#x27;s very compact.</li>
            <li>The cord comes in handy for hanging it up if you so desire</li>
            <li>but I do wish It came with it&#x27;s own case.</li>
            <li>Really like the size of this, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>This will come in handy for traveling.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size.</li>
            <li>She is also accident prone and wears very strong prescription lenses, so there was no way I wanted her to shave with a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>worth the purchase.you will be happy with it</li>
            <li>It does a good job shaving, but no matter how light a pressure I use it leaves my skin irritated.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully; however, please be aware that an electric shaver will NEVER shave as closely as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is still very fine, so</li>
            <li>So while it does a nice job it takes longer than my regular and is not quite ad close but perfectly acceptable for the swimsuit if you use it every day.</li>
            <li>It works better than most that I have used, and for the size, it&#x27;s really handy.</li>
            <li>Great first time shaver for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Feels very comfortable in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews posted on Amazon before making this choice.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li>Might as well try it for the price, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>But i will say that there is technique involved for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li>Overall an awesome product and price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just okay with it.</li>
            <li>At any rate, she is pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Well, okay,</li>
            <li>I have the one with tiger stripes in purple, CUTE</li>
            <li>the most sleek shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do you even need more?&lt;br /&gt;Great product, love it, will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works better than the celio that I got a year ago.</li>
            <li>and my doctor told me that an electric razor would be ok to use.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shaver for bikini area</li>
            <li>but ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Followed by much more giggling and squealing...</li>
            <li>and I like being able to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>wife love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand why anything Panasonic gets better ratings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it.  </li>
            <li>Safe close shave.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is in every way superior to my higher priced Remington and Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty good around the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I have another one of these travel razors, and love its easy &#x27;use&#x27;...</li>
            <li>TO CLEAN IT!</li>
            <li>So far I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, gives a smooth shave</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave so far is great.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this razor when I was going in for surgery, and knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily use a blade.</li>
            <li>Easy to use item.  </li>
            <li>The care guide is easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve just borrowed the husband&#x27;s fancy electric man-shaver for touchups, but it&#x27;s often a hassle if he takes it with him as he travels, sometimes he misplaces it, or just doesn&#x27;t clean it (ick).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use push button on and off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack when you&#x27;re going away too.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and itÂ´s what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good, but it really comes in handy when you need a quick shave!</li>
            <li>Remington makes The Best shavers hands down.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it first to make sure it would be as safe and easy for her to handle as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>easy use, light and compact.</li>
            <li>To me it works fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine by me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low-cost, easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Certainly cost effective.</li>
            <li>Size of the Women&#x27;s Travel Shaver is absolutely perfect; it takes up little space and</li>
            <li>This one seems more durable, and it certainly works better without clogging or pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li>It eliminated my problems with ingrown hair bumps which was a huge relief</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Great travel razor size regular</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to shaving with a regular razor, but this works great in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>light and travels well.</li>
            <li>Does good so far like it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute, and the price was certainly right.</li>
            <li>It is small and light - perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>The best small shaver I have found.</li>
            <li>It is meant for travel and is a perfect small size.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get a super smooth shave, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a travel one</li>
            <li>It gives a really clean shave but not too close.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; works just as advertised-- dry or in shower.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find any way to take it apart to clean it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem too smart to use it with water, even though directions say it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced shaver (regular and electric) and nicked myself on the first swipe.</li>
            <li>This is a good one for the low price.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m not always 100% on top of shaving my legs regularly, hahaha, and so, the work can backup, considerably!&lt;br</li>
            <li>really, for 10 bucks, could you ask for more?</li>
            <li>So I ordered this one hoping to replace my old razor or at lease have a nice one to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a non-electric razor, but I have found that true of all electric razors.  </li>
            <li>It provides a good close shave but the batteries (if used daily)</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s still on the first set of batteries and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver for light or touchup jobs.  </li>
            <li>other great points:&lt;br /&gt;*This</li>
            <li>the job done QUICK</li>
            <li>Item as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>, it gets VERY hot), I would flinch at the thought of slaving away at the shower shaving my legs with disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great little shaver for quick shaving on the go.</li>
            <li>It stop working after the first use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver for travel.</li>
            <li>I think for the price it is just fine and will last a healthy length of time.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, not very expensive and works just fine.</li>
            <li>shave isn&#x27;t as close and smooth as with a Women&#x27;s Schick Quattro http://amzn.com/B001E764U8, but it REALLY does get the job done in like</li>
            <li>Pleased with it so far, would buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s necessary to re-shave more than once in order to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>would make a nice present, who can&#x27;t use a shaver?.</li>
            <li>Liked it well enough to share with friends.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost and cheaper than some.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my old electric until I can find something better.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>My legs are super soft and it was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that I would like this razor, because all the other one&#x27;s I have ordered haven&#x27;t been good...</li>
            <li>to keep clean, it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money on something more powerful.</li>
            <li>This is great for travel or everyday use!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, very light, highly packable, seems reasonably long-lived (survived three months of travel, knocking around Europe), and gives a nice, extremely close shave--without pinching or biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only use it for travel and so far so good</li>
            <li>So compact and easy to use and not heavy like a mans shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>FOR SENSITIVE SKIN: no cuts, burns, rash, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>At the very first touch she giggling and wiggling all over, she&#x27;s very ticklish.  </li>
            <li>It is small and handy but it really is only good for emergency &#x27;</li>
            <li>Very gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li>Good little shaver...easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It smarted a fair bit and drew a little blood.</li>
            <li>This is small and very portable, so great for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>so I can look respectable outside in shorts :</li>
            <li>it cuts well, better than her regular electric razor.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>This one is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I ordered this to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver.  </li>
            <li>I get severe under arm skin irritation and hair bumps with razors or creams so this actually worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>This replacement is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>Good in a pinch, but I was looking for something I could use everyday.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap and effective electric razor, then this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>Good, basic and for the price it is OK; but it is not a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver was purchased as a gift for my junior high age granddaughter and it is a terricific success.</li>
            <li>works amazingly well for someone with really sensitive skin like myself, when I can normally only use 1 particular shaver and in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>The shorter handle and large thumb and finger pad for holding</li>
            <li>I thought a more expensive shaver would be better, but this little one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Everything is great up to now, only used it a few times.</li>
            <li>I got it specifically for my underarms, which always suffer from razor or standard shaver shaves, so it&#x27;s well fit for purpose.  </li>
            <li>It has a trimmer on each side which is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s very portable for going to the gym, or whatever</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very portable &amp; not bulky.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs and under my arms doesn&#x27;t grow that fast, so it really does nothing for me.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this gift for our daughter, she&#x27;s 9 but has very hairy legs which she is forever complaining about.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you a really close shave</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it on my legs so that doesn&#x27;t really matter for me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this razor -</li>
            <li>Installing the batteries and cleaning the heads are straightforward and simple.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had come with a cleaning brush, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>When you are my age, older, you don&#x27;t have that much hair that needs to be removed either under the arms and/or the legs</li>
            <li>This is very gentle on the skin...doesnt always get a close enough shave, but as an emergency shaver, it works really well!</li>
            <li>I use it for my legs and bikini area and the first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t get close enough but by the second time, it was very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to make quick work of heavier jobs.</li>
            <li>Bought one at Walmart a few years back and loved it.  </li>
            <li>And it did not give a close shave; many entire hairs got missed, even over several passes.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package, I notice what I assume are the bikini line trimmers on either side of the main shaving head.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase, &amp; I would recommend it to anyone looking for a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>if i want that silkiness to impress in high heels, I just retouch with the Schick Quattro, and since the job is already done, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job as a razor.</li>
            <li>I like that it takes normal batteries and that it&#x27;s NOT rechargeable, since I don&#x27;t need to leave it on a charger cluttering up my bathroom.</li>
            <li>So normally if i decide I want to go to the pool or something but</li>
            <li>Finally broke down &amp; got my own shaver.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but is nice to have  when in a hurry, shaving is needed, and you don&#x27;t want the mess of soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Having cut her legs with a regular razor, she was a little nervous that it would cut her, but once she tried it, she was thrilled</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a med student (very, VERY busy)</li>
            <li>Overall, I think for the price and quality that it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a wet or dry razor.</li>
            <li>I have tried this wet and dry and love it.</li>
            <li>OK, so I bought this little razor for its amazingly low price, and found that it was a winner!  </li>
            <li>Now I need to go buy regular batteries and check to see how much of a difference it will make.</li>
            <li>No where near a close shave.</li>
            <li>the razor was for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work very well, compared to my regular shaver.</li>
            <li>product does what it is suppose to with out any problems so far.</li>
            <li>I got this electric razor to use post knee surgery because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use a razor anywhere near the incision for months.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Remington because I have a really old women&#x27;s electric Remington that still works well</li>
            <li>My old $40 rechargeable Remington bit the dust.</li>
            <li>Had a old Remington shaver that needed replacing.  </li>
            <li>and I was incredibly surprised with this one.</li>
            <li>Not heavy duty</li>
            <li>So as something of a gag I put it in her stocking marked &amp;#34;from the Elves&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So the 9 year old turns to me wiggles her eyebrows and says, &amp;</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with it and would give it 5 stars except that the clear plastic blade cover does not fit tightly</li>
            <li>coz its small and easy to use</li>
            <li>Remington is used dry, so I can just put a blanket under my legs, and shave while i watch tv, without even really having to focus, because i get NO cuts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to order this razor, and I&#x27;ll never buy the other ones again.</li>
            <li>It is pathetically weak and its already minimal power audibly wound down even more during the first shave, after a full charging.</li>
            <li>This one is small and really comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Wish we could get a plain strong shaver without all the extra frills.</li>
            <li>This little shaver didn&#x27;t cost much, but you get what you paid for which isn&#x27;t much of a shaver.  </li>
            <li>so when my last electric shaver stopped working I didn&#x27;t rush to get a new one.</li>
            <li>the schick intuition, which is the only one that I had been able to ever use without my legs being red raw and itchy as heck afterwards.</li>
            <li>Will be Good 4 as a back up razor when all else fails</li>
            <li>If you loose it you didn&#x27;t lose much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact design allows for easy handling especially for those who have arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>However for avoiding painful, itchy hair bumps this is a great solution.</li>
            <li>So far it works well, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to take this on vacation where I was going to wear shorts or outfits that would leave my legs bare because hair would show using this razor.  </li>
            <li>Small, lightweight, runs on batteries, and is just as effective as my everyday electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>haent shaved, i would have to go have an extra shower first, just to shave with my other shaver..</li>
            <li>The shave won&#x27;t last as long as a regular-razor shave, but you can get it almost as smooth with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for tender areas, and the batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Like the most recent reviewer before me said, it is weak and missed hairs after several passes.  </li>
            <li>Quick shave for my legs, delicate enough for under arms.</li>
            <li>The batteries have lasted a very long time, and it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m getting ready for a date in my youth or shaving every other day.</li>
            <li>They are not nearly as good, they scrape your legs, they pull at your leg hairs if they&#x27;re at all long, they aren&#x27;t as good on the bikini line, and they dull faster.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I have to say that I love it!</li>
            <li> Its really cute and girly yet does the job!</li>
            <li> This is probably my 5th Remington shaver and I love them!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> The best part: it&#x27;s very compact.</li>
            <li> The cord comes in handy for hanging it up if you so desire</li>
            <li> but I do wish It came with it&#x27;s own case.</li>
            <li> Really like the size of this, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> This will come in handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size.</li>
            <li> She is also accident prone and wears very strong prescription lenses, so there was no way I wanted her to shave with a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> worth the purchase.you will be happy with it</li>
            <li> It does a good job shaving, but no matter how light a pressure I use it leaves my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully; however, please be aware that an electric shaver will NEVER shave as closely as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is still very fine, so</li>
            <li> So while it does a nice job it takes longer than my regular and is not quite ad close but perfectly acceptable for the swimsuit if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> It works better than most that I have used, and for the size, it&#x27;s really handy.</li>
            <li> Great first time shaver for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Feels very comfortable in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews posted on Amazon before making this choice.</li>
            <li> Glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li> Might as well try it for the price, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> But i will say that there is technique involved for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> Overall an awesome product and price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just okay with it.</li>
            <li> At any rate, she is pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Well, okay,</li>
            <li> I have the one with tiger stripes in purple, CUTE</li>
            <li> the most sleek shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do you even need more?&lt;br /&gt;Great product, love it, will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works better than the celio that I got a year ago.</li>
            <li> and my doctor told me that an electric razor would be ok to use.  </li>
            <li> My favorite shaver for bikini area</li>
            <li> but ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Followed by much more giggling and squealing...</li>
            <li> and I like being able to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> wife love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why anything Panasonic gets better ratings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it.  </li>
            <li> Safe close shave.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is in every way superior to my higher priced Remington and Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty good around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have another one of these travel razors, and love its easy &#x27;use&#x27;...</li>
            <li> TO CLEAN IT!</li>
            <li> So far I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, gives a smooth shave</li>
            <li> The quality of the shave so far is great.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor when I was going in for surgery, and knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily use a blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to use item.  </li>
            <li> The care guide is easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve just borrowed the husband&#x27;s fancy electric man-shaver for touchups, but it&#x27;s often a hassle if he takes it with him as he travels, sometimes he misplaces it, or just doesn&#x27;t clean it (ick).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use push button on and off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to pack when you&#x27;re going away too.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and itÂ´s what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good, but it really comes in handy when you need a quick shave!</li>
            <li> Remington makes The Best shavers hands down.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it first to make sure it would be as safe and easy for her to handle as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> easy use, light and compact.</li>
            <li> To me it works fine.</li>
            <li> it works fine by me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low-cost, easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Certainly cost effective.</li>
            <li> Size of the Women&#x27;s Travel Shaver is absolutely perfect; it takes up little space and</li>
            <li> This one seems more durable, and it certainly works better without clogging or pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> It eliminated my problems with ingrown hair bumps which was a huge relief</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great travel razor size regular</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to shaving with a regular razor, but this works great in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> light and travels well.</li>
            <li> Does good so far like it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cute, and the price was certainly right.</li>
            <li> It is small and light - perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> The best small shaver I have found.</li>
            <li> It is meant for travel and is a perfect small size.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get a super smooth shave, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a travel one</li>
            <li> It gives a really clean shave but not too close.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; works just as advertised-- dry or in shower.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find any way to take it apart to clean it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem too smart to use it with water, even though directions say it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced shaver (regular and electric) and nicked myself on the first swipe.</li>
            <li> This is a good one for the low price.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not always 100% on top of shaving my legs regularly, hahaha, and so, the work can backup, considerably!&lt;br</li>
            <li> really, for 10 bucks, could you ask for more?</li>
            <li> So I ordered this one hoping to replace my old razor or at lease have a nice one to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a non-electric razor, but I have found that true of all electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It provides a good close shave but the batteries (if used daily)</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s still on the first set of batteries and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for light or touchup jobs.  </li>
            <li> other great points:&lt;br /&gt;*This</li>
            <li> the job done QUICK</li>
            <li> Item as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> , it gets VERY hot), I would flinch at the thought of slaving away at the shower shaving my legs with disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great little shaver for quick shaving on the go.</li>
            <li> It stop working after the first use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver for travel.</li>
            <li> I think for the price it is just fine and will last a healthy length of time.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, not very expensive and works just fine.</li>
            <li> shave isn&#x27;t as close and smooth as with a Women&#x27;s Schick Quattro http://amzn.com/B001E764U8, but it REALLY does get the job done in like</li>
            <li> Pleased with it so far, would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s necessary to re-shave more than once in order to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> would make a nice present, who can&#x27;t use a shaver?.</li>
            <li> Liked it well enough to share with friends.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost and cheaper than some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my old electric until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> My legs are super soft and it was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that I would like this razor, because all the other one&#x27;s I have ordered haven&#x27;t been good...</li>
            <li> to keep clean, it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money on something more powerful.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel or everyday use!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, very light, highly packable, seems reasonably long-lived (survived three months of travel, knocking around Europe), and gives a nice, extremely close shave--without pinching or biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only use it for travel and so far so good</li>
            <li> So compact and easy to use and not heavy like a mans shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> FOR SENSITIVE SKIN: no cuts, burns, rash, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> At the very first touch she giggling and wiggling all over, she&#x27;s very ticklish.  </li>
            <li> It is small and handy but it really is only good for emergency &#x27;</li>
            <li> Very gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver...easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It smarted a fair bit and drew a little blood.</li>
            <li> This is small and very portable, so great for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> so I can look respectable outside in shorts :</li>
            <li> it cuts well, better than her regular electric razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> This one is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver.  </li>
            <li> I get severe under arm skin irritation and hair bumps with razors or creams so this actually worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> This replacement is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Good in a pinch, but I was looking for something I could use everyday.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheap and effective electric razor, then this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Good, basic and for the price it is OK; but it is not a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver was purchased as a gift for my junior high age granddaughter and it is a terricific success.</li>
            <li> works amazingly well for someone with really sensitive skin like myself, when I can normally only use 1 particular shaver and in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> The shorter handle and large thumb and finger pad for holding</li>
            <li> I thought a more expensive shaver would be better, but this little one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Everything is great up to now, only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I got it specifically for my underarms, which always suffer from razor or standard shaver shaves, so it&#x27;s well fit for purpose.  </li>
            <li> It has a trimmer on each side which is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s very portable for going to the gym, or whatever</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very portable &amp; not bulky.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs and under my arms doesn&#x27;t grow that fast, so it really does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this gift for our daughter, she&#x27;s 9 but has very hairy legs which she is forever complaining about.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a really close shave</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it on my legs so that doesn&#x27;t really matter for me.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this razor -</li>
            <li> Installing the batteries and cleaning the heads are straightforward and simple.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had come with a cleaning brush, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> When you are my age, older, you don&#x27;t have that much hair that needs to be removed either under the arms and/or the legs</li>
            <li> This is very gentle on the skin...doesnt always get a close enough shave, but as an emergency shaver, it works really well!</li>
            <li> I use it for my legs and bikini area and the first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t get close enough but by the second time, it was very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to make quick work of heavier jobs.</li>
            <li> Bought one at Walmart a few years back and loved it.  </li>
            <li> And it did not give a close shave; many entire hairs got missed, even over several passes.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package, I notice what I assume are the bikini line trimmers on either side of the main shaving head.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, &amp; I would recommend it to anyone looking for a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> if i want that silkiness to impress in high heels, I just retouch with the Schick Quattro, and since the job is already done, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job as a razor.</li>
            <li> I like that it takes normal batteries and that it&#x27;s NOT rechargeable, since I don&#x27;t need to leave it on a charger cluttering up my bathroom.</li>
            <li> So normally if i decide I want to go to the pool or something but</li>
            <li> Finally broke down &amp; got my own shaver.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but is nice to have  when in a hurry, shaving is needed, and you don&#x27;t want the mess of soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Having cut her legs with a regular razor, she was a little nervous that it would cut her, but once she tried it, she was thrilled</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a med student (very, VERY busy)</li>
            <li> Overall, I think for the price and quality that it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s a wet or dry razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried this wet and dry and love it.</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought this little razor for its amazingly low price, and found that it was a winner!  </li>
            <li> Now I need to go buy regular batteries and check to see how much of a difference it will make.</li>
            <li> No where near a close shave.</li>
            <li> the razor was for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work very well, compared to my regular shaver.</li>
            <li> product does what it is suppose to with out any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I got this electric razor to use post knee surgery because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use a razor anywhere near the incision for months.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Remington because I have a really old women&#x27;s electric Remington that still works well</li>
            <li> My old $40 rechargeable Remington bit the dust.</li>
            <li> Had a old Remington shaver that needed replacing.  </li>
            <li> and I was incredibly surprised with this one.</li>
            <li> Not heavy duty</li>
            <li> So as something of a gag I put it in her stocking marked &amp;#34;from the Elves&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> So the 9 year old turns to me wiggles her eyebrows and says, &amp;</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with it and would give it 5 stars except that the clear plastic blade cover does not fit tightly</li>
            <li> coz its small and easy to use</li>
            <li> Remington is used dry, so I can just put a blanket under my legs, and shave while i watch tv, without even really having to focus, because i get NO cuts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to order this razor, and I&#x27;ll never buy the other ones again.</li>
            <li> It is pathetically weak and its already minimal power audibly wound down even more during the first shave, after a full charging.</li>
            <li> This one is small and really comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Wish we could get a plain strong shaver without all the extra frills.</li>
            <li> This little shaver didn&#x27;t cost much, but you get what you paid for which isn&#x27;t much of a shaver.  </li>
            <li> so when my last electric shaver stopped working I didn&#x27;t rush to get a new one.</li>
            <li> the schick intuition, which is the only one that I had been able to ever use without my legs being red raw and itchy as heck afterwards.</li>
            <li> Will be Good 4 as a back up razor when all else fails</li>
            <li> If you loose it you didn&#x27;t lose much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact design allows for easy handling especially for those who have arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> However for avoiding painful, itchy hair bumps this is a great solution.</li>
            <li> So far it works well, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to take this on vacation where I was going to wear shorts or outfits that would leave my legs bare because hair would show using this razor.  </li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, runs on batteries, and is just as effective as my everyday electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> haent shaved, i would have to go have an extra shower first, just to shave with my other shaver..</li>
            <li> The shave won&#x27;t last as long as a regular-razor shave, but you can get it almost as smooth with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for tender areas, and the batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Like the most recent reviewer before me said, it is weak and missed hairs after several passes.  </li>
            <li> Quick shave for my legs, delicate enough for under arms.</li>
            <li> The batteries have lasted a very long time, and it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m getting ready for a date in my youth or shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as good, they scrape your legs, they pull at your leg hairs if they&#x27;re at all long, they aren&#x27;t as good on the bikini line, and they dull faster.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is good but a little weak on getting as close of a shave as my 1965 electric model.  </li>
            <li> Although in my late 60s, I very seldom need to shave, I&#x27;m still getting one of these for myself!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*The blades last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only concern is how long it will last in the long run.</li>
            <li> She is new to shaving her underarms and is still a little nervous about handling a razor.  </li>
            <li> only dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it to dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the other shavers had the same instructions, but this one says don&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries as the voltage on them is too low and would hinder the performance of the shaver.</li>
            <li> How long one can use it before changing batteries--I can&#x27;t say yet.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to wait that long to shave though</li>
            <li> Clearly not built for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very shocked at how close it shaved, not as close as a razor, but still great.</li>
            <li> I actually went back to my Lady Remington after my walmart razor got too painful to use, and it was better after 2 years of regular use than the walmart one was after only a few months.</li>
            <li> I did have a little trouble figuring out where the batteries went and then since my fingers are not so nimble any more it was a little hard to get the back cover off, but once done everything fell in place.  </li>
            <li> then other similar ones I used before.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my legs when I shaved them dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with stubble even after going over the same spot a few times.  </li>
            <li> However it does cause some irritation if you keep running it over your skin to try and catch every single hair.</li>
            <li> It barely trimmed any hair off after all that trouble.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased much more expensive razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m single now and really in no rush to show off legs</li>
            <li> Bought this little thing at Wal-Mart for about the same price</li>
            <li> As she finishes up our youngest comes to see what&#x27;s going on, and we tell her that big sis is learning to shave her legs, which of course leads to the little one begging to learn as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to use it wet;</li>
            <li> Ended up ordering 2 more...one for each teenage granddaughters for their birthdays in a few months.</li>
            <li> Since I only use it for a few minutes at a time, maybe once a week-ish, I didn&#x27;t want anything that will take up space or need to worry that it isn&#x27;t charged.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t plan to ever use it as a wet shaver, so this doesn&#x27;t bug me.</li>
            <li> Even though this is a wet/dry razor I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it get wet.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, the bottom  doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on this one, so it keeps falling off--thus the razor stops when it does!</li>
            <li> What a terrific little shaver this is!  </li>
            <li> You do not angle the blade, you have to press down firmly, and the batteries need to be changed regularly.</li>
            <li> It shaves well compared to other electric shavers I used.</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver 5 stars based on what it is - a small, battery operated, electric shaver that shouldn&#x27;t be compared to an actual razor.</li>
            <li> I have had other razors and some were scratchy and did not do the job.  </li>
            <li> but this works just as well as my other electric shaver that cost $150.</li>
            <li> plus I can get a replacement head for this that I can not get for the other.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty much useless for me.</li>
            <li> we have one leg done, and she volunteers to do the other leg herself.  </li>
            <li> This did not work well compared to a regular electric shaver- leaves loads of hairs behind and takes forever to get enough of the hair trimmed down</li>
            <li> Too bad there are no foil replacements for this product, but it&#x27;s very affordable to replace with a new one every few years.</li>
            <li> it has little pink flowers on it</li>
            <li> I hardly use my regular razor anymore.</li>
            <li> also want to say that when I figured my blades must be getting dull, I went to buy another one and could only find the walmart and target versions.</li>
            <li> I went over the same area at least 5 times before I could tell it cut any hair.</li>
            <li> not sure how it would work on an adult with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> or I wanted to wear shorts or a skirt (down here in the tropics</li>
            <li> So we sit down</li>
            <li> it is small enough to tuck in a small handbag.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much less noisy</li>
            <li> I have tried it on my under arms with little to no success.</li>
            <li> No problem; Remington here will get you out of a tight spot in a</li>
            <li> The lid was on tight as directed.  </li>
            <li> and this little battery powered razor works</li>
            <li> , she was a little worried that it would hurt, so I shaved my knee cap and had her touch her finger to the foil.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver to keep in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li> I like it for everyday use too.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and have for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money purchasing tis item.</li>
            <li> Do not get this confused with your regular shaver.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> At first she was shocked, almost appalled really, but a little while later she gets it out, puts batteries in it and asks me if I&#x27;ll show her how to shave her legs.  </li>
            <li> This was an inexpensive shaver, but, even at a low price, it was not worth the cost because the shaver is useless.</li>
            <li> No soapy mess!</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll buy a bunch of these little gems and store them away as a hedge against the day they will be discontinued!</li>
            <li> also have extremely sensitive skin; I have to constantly switch blades of other brands even before the &#x27;suggested&#x27; usage; and I always get rash, cuts, allergic reactions, and those weird little painful leg pimples even with moisturizer and cream after shaving.</li>
            <li> I just needed something small that would do the job.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it as a daily shaver just because of its size and the fact that buying replacement batteries is expensive (since this is not rechargeable).</li>
            <li> Fits into small spaces in purse or suitcase.</li>
            <li> No back pain from bending over like in those unrealistic tv commercials (women who shave already shaven, slimy-smooth legs, really?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m lazy, so that says something)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small, reliable, and portable.  </li>
            <li> Small and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had a hip replacement, since I couldn&#x27;t bend to shave my leg as usual and had to have help.  </li>
            <li> When it got dull</li>
            <li> Hardly cuts anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave hardly at all.</li>
            <li> and I show her the different cutting tools on it</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT MAGICAL!</li>
            <li> I previously have had two Panasonic rechargeable wet/dry shavers, which are twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Should have just got the bag of $2 razors, at least they would have shaved the hair off my legs!</li>
            <li> The shaver is not very good and the foil itself is useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward with the curves</li>
            <li> Poor quality and end results.</li>
            <li> but Unfortunately I cut myself once.</li>
            <li> no hazard: take out the batteries, and you can put it in your bag and you won&#x27;t even get cut when you&#x27;re blindly sticking your hand, looking for something</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this does not shave closely.</li>
            <li> Impossible finding out how to install batteries.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I really hate shaving in the shower, so I was looking for something I could use with or without water and found this item.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the jagged blade at the edge gave me a nasty nick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it . easy use, light and compact. Quick shave for my legs, delicate enough for under arms. Pleased with it so far, would buy again.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm amd it is small enough to tuck in a small handbag. I like it for everyday use too.</li>
            <li> Worked for a second...</li>
            <li> I do not like this. It feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Good in a pinch, but I was looking for something I could use everyday. Doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave for that. Good for travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use item.  Certainly cost effective.</li>
            <li> This is small and very portable, so great for travel. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job as a razor. It&#x27;s necessary to re-shave more than once in order to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> These are great travel shavers. For the price, these are very nice. Great shave. If you loose it you didn&#x27;t lose much. I use everyday and have for years. I always keep one in my purse for anytime.</li>
            <li> So far I am quite happy with this product. The care guide is easy to follow. The shaver is lightweight and does a good job. I read many reviews posted on Amazon before making this choice. I don&#x27;t plan to use it wet; only dry. This is based on comments in the reviews. I think for the price it is just fine and will last a healthy length of time. Glad I made the choice. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet, but already like the use of batteries vs. electricity.  Feels very comfortable in the hand.  Look forward to trying it out.</li>
            <li> It works for me just great.  I use it at home not just for travel.  I should have gotten one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for light or touchup jobs.  It doesn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to make quick work of heavier jobs. I got it specifically for my underarms, which always suffer from razor or standard shaver shaves, so it&#x27;s well fit for purpose.  It is small and light - perfect for travel.  Installing the batteries and cleaning the heads are straightforward and simple.  Am very pleased with it and would give it 5 stars except that the clear plastic blade cover does not fit tightly so I have a rubber band around it.  Nuisance!</li>
            <li> Bought this little thing at Wal-Mart for about the same price and I have to say that I love it! I hardly use my regular razor anymore. It doesn&#x27;t get a super smooth shave, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a travel one (Hence, the five stars). It&#x27;s perfect for when I&#x27;m in a hurry and need to just touch up my legs of underarms. It has a trimmer on each side which is also very convenient. Overall, I think for the price and quality that it was exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend it. Remington did a great job with this product. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and simple to use. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and the batteries are still going strong. I also love that it&#x27;s a wet or dry razor. How convenient is that? Might as well try it for the price, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shaver often enough to give it a proper rating. So far it works well, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times. The best part: it&#x27;s very compact. It shaves well compared to other electric shavers I used. How long one can use it before changing batteries--I can&#x27;t say yet.</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver 5 stars based on what it is - a small, battery operated, electric shaver that shouldn&#x27;t be compared to an actual razor. If what you want is an efficient, effective, non-painful way to quickly shave your legs, this is an awesome razor. But i will say that there is technique involved for the best possible shave. You do not angle the blade, you have to press down firmly, and the batteries need to be changed regularly. The shave won&#x27;t last as long as a regular-razor shave, but you can get it almost as smooth with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other great points:&lt;br /&gt;*This razor has never given me ingrown hairs or any form of irritation on my bikini line. It is the only thing I use for those areas anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very portable for going to the gym, or whatever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The blades last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that when I figured my blades must be getting dull, I went to buy another one and could only find the walmart and target versions. They are not nearly as good, they scrape your legs, they pull at your leg hairs if they&#x27;re at all long, they aren&#x27;t as good on the bikini line, and they dull faster. I actually went back to my Lady Remington after my walmart razor got too painful to use, and it was better after 2 years of regular use than the walmart one was after only a few months. It&#x27;s worth it to order this razor, and I&#x27;ll never buy the other ones again.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with my Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> I just needed something small that would do the job.  I have had other razors and some were scratchy and did not do the job.  This is a good one for the low price.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, runs on batteries, and is just as effective as my everyday electric shaver.  Thumbs up!  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver...easy to use.  Ended up ordering 2 more...one for each teenage granddaughters for their birthdays in a few months.</li>
            <li> Great travel razor size regular that also works well for regular use.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for tender areas, and the batteries last a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but is nice to have  when in a hurry, shaving is needed, and you don&#x27;t want the mess of soap and water.  I would definitely order again.  I&#x27;ve only used it to dry shave.  Doesn&#x27;t seem too smart to use it with water, even though directions say it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, gives a smooth shave and it&#x27;s much less noisy then other similar ones I used before.</li>
            <li> Its really cute and girly yet does the job! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it as a daily shaver just because of its size and the fact that buying replacement batteries is expensive (since this is not rechargeable). I have used it for my legs, bikini area and underarms every day for 2 weeks while on vacation. Overall an awesome product and price! Some people say you get what you pay for but this works just as well as my other electric shaver that cost $150.</li>
            <li> I have another one of these travel razors, and love its easy &#x27;use&#x27;...unfortunately, the bottom  doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on this one, so it keeps falling off--thus the razor stops when it does!</li>
            <li> This shaver was purchased as a gift for my junior high age granddaughter and it is a terricific success. Having cut her legs with a regular razor, she was a little nervous that it would cut her, but once she tried it, she was thrilled and I was impressed with the smoothness and ease that it did the job. Although in my late 60s, I very seldom need to shave, I&#x27;m still getting one of these for myself! Great product -- kudoos to Remington for a job well done!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Size of the Women&#x27;s Travel Shaver is absolutely perfect; it takes up little space and it&#x27;s battery operated (2AAA batteries are needed).  I had to go over the area a few times for hair removal, but this really was not a detriment to me, but to others it may be.  When traveling, waxing may not be an option, this shaver is a great substitute.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, but also at home.  Great when you&#x27;re in a hurry. Fits into small spaces in purse or suitcase.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 5th Remington shaver and I love them! This one is small and really comfortable in my hand. It gives a really clean shave but not too close. The cord comes in handy for hanging it up if you so desire but I do wish It came with it&#x27;s own case. Thankfully I still have a carrying case from my last shaver and it&#x27;s brush. This one does not come with a brush for cleaning!  What&#x27;s up with that Remington?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the other shavers had the same instructions, but this one says don&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries as the voltage on them is too low and would hinder the performance of the shaver. Remington, I use rechargeable  to same money and help the environment. Now I need to go buy regular batteries and check to see how much of a difference it will make. To me it works fine. So unless using rechargeables with damage the shaver in some way, I don&#x27;t mind using rechargeables &#x27;cause it works fine by me.</li>
            <li> Good for travel I suppose, and for touch-ups. No where near a close shave. I&#x27;m just okay with it. I&#x27;m not pushing this one, you can decide if you want to give it a go. Took me awhile to give in and buy it. Will be Good 4 as a back up razor when all else fails</li>
            <li> This did not work well compared to a regular electric shaver- leaves loads of hairs behind and takes forever to get enough of the hair trimmed down so it is not so noticable.  I was looking for a smaller one for travel but now take my regular one when we travel.  On the lookout now for a good travel one!</li>
            <li> the razor was for my 12 year old daughter.  It arrived on time.  It works great.  Her hair is still very fine, so not sure how it would work on an adult with thick hair.  At any rate, she is pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> My mother was looking for a low cost electric razor so I got this for her to try. She&#x27;s very pleased with it. It&#x27;s low-cost, easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to maintain. She&#x27;s still on the first set of batteries and they&#x27;re still going strong. If you want a cheap and effective electric razor, then this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> worth the purchase.you will be happy with it</li>
            <li> This razor works great! I am very pleased with my purchase, &amp; I would recommend it to anyone looking for a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> Impossible finding out how to install batteries.  Good, basic and for the price it is OK; but it is not a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect razor. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Bought one at Walmart a few years back and loved it.  When it got dull I kept my eye out but never saw it in stores again.  this was a great replacement</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Really like the size of this, perfect for travel.  It does a good job shaving, but no matter how light a pressure I use it leaves my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Things I like: the size and the design.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: it doesn&#x27;t work very well, compared to my regular shaver. It&#x27;s good in a pinch for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Great first time shaver for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item. Poor quality and end results. Don&#x27;t waste time or money purchasing tis item. Disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  It&#x27;s my first electric shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li> not quite as efficient as the Lady Remington I bought in 1976. and still use.  This will come in handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> Only use it for travel and so far so good</li>
            <li> No stars. Well, okay, one star because I had to post a rating and 1 Star &#x3D; I hate it. Correct. This was an inexpensive shaver, but, even at a low price, it was not worth the cost because the shaver is useless. I do NOT recommend this item for anyone.</li>
            <li> Everything is great up to now, only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good, but it really comes in handy when you need a quick shave!</li>
            <li> I have the one with tiger stripes in purple, CUTE, it&#x27;s lightweight and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to keep clean, it&#x27;s very portable. would make a nice present, who can&#x27;t use a shaver?.</li>
            <li> It is not the greatest design, so it takes a lot longer to do the job. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am using this for 4 months now. I like it coz its small and easy to use but Unfortunately I cut myself once. ð My husband told me I should not cut myself coz this is an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent travel razor.</li>
            <li> Received this and immediately wanted to try it. So compact and easy to use and not heavy like a mans shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Will be the perfect shaver to pack for travel. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Great little shaver for travel. Easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone.  No cords. Battery operated. It doesn&#x27;t take up space iny travel bag.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job.  AAA are a pain but I knew it when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens for like $12 (cheaper on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a med student (very, VERY busy), so I&#x27;m not always 100% on top of shaving my legs regularly, hahaha, and so, the work can backup, considerably!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my friends used to invite me to the beach or I wanted to wear shorts or a skirt (down here in the tropics, it gets VERY hot), I would flinch at the thought of slaving away at the shower shaving my legs with disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely sensitive skin; I have to constantly switch blades of other brands even before the &#x27;suggested&#x27; usage; and I always get rash, cuts, allergic reactions, and those weird little painful leg pimples even with moisturizer and cream after shaving. Not to mention the burn! Especially when you get into the water at the beachâ¦&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AJÃ!! Well, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington is used dry, so I can just put a blanket under my legs, and shave while i watch tv, without even really having to focus, because i get NO cuts! No soapy mess! No rash or pimples or ingrown-hairs! No back pain from bending over like in those unrealistic tv commercials (women who shave already shaven, slimy-smooth legs, really?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave isn&#x27;t as close and smooth as with a Women&#x27;s Schick Quattro http://amzn.com/B001E764U8, but it REALLY does get the job done in like 2MINUTES so I can look respectable outside in shorts :D&lt;br /&gt;And if i want that silkiness to impress in high heels, I just retouch with the Schick Quattro, and since the job is already done, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, and it&#x27;s still working. I take it with me when I travel, go back to parent&#x27;s house, sleepovers, camping, whatever!!! I take out the batteries immediately after using it, and put them back in next time (so the batteries don&#x27;t spoil and ruin it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, in SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-SMALL (put it in your bag!)&lt;br /&gt;-2 AA batteries (no need to recharge when you&#x27;re on the run)&lt;br /&gt;-very CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;-RELIABLE (months of use, no complaints)&lt;br /&gt;-GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN: no cuts, burns, rash, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely EASY TO USE (and I&#x27;m lazy, so that says something)&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done QUICK (you&#x27;re going out, decided to change your wardrobe and forgot to shave your legs? No problem; Remington here will get you out of a tight spot in a jiffy.)&lt;br /&gt;-Virtually no hazard: take out the batteries, and you can put it in your bag and you won&#x27;t even get cut when you&#x27;re blindly sticking your hand, looking for something else)&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Not the most sleek shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, for 10 bucks, could you ask for more? Do you even need more?&lt;br /&gt;Great product, love it, will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER TO CLEAN IT! IT&#x27;S NOT MAGICAL!</li>
            <li> Too bad there are no foil replacements for this product, but it&#x27;s very affordable to replace with a new one every few years.</li>
            <li> I really hate shaving in the shower, so I was looking for something I could use with or without water and found this item. It works great and I never have to worry about razor burn. Would recommend to anyone who hates having to deal with shaving cream and the risk of falling in the shower.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother who is now in nursing care. She has always shaved her chin hairs over the years with a toss-out razor, but I now help her shave her chin and this little battery powered razor works so well I plan to get one for myself to use on my legs.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is good but a little weak on getting as close of a shave as my 1965 electric model.  Wish we could get a plain strong shaver without all the extra frills.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price. Liked it well enough to share with friends. Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Picked this up as a resource prior to having surgery.  Works beautifully; however, please be aware that an electric shaver will NEVER shave as closely as a blade.  Six weeks post op, I still use the razor to run over the incision site.  And it has earned a space in my travel gear as the go to for hotels that believe a 3 ft square shower is plenty of room.  Also, please note, that although the packaging SAYS you can use it in the shower, I have not (nor will I) use it in the shower.  Clearly not built for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and this shaver did not remove any of my hair.</li>
            <li> works better than the celio that I got a year ago. plus I can get a replacement head for this that I can not get for the other. Worth the cost and cheaper than some.</li>
            <li> We bought this shaver for extended camping. It runs on 2 AA batteries. Although my wife only used it once (we are not camping yet) it cuts well, better than her regular electric razor. Nice.</li>
            <li> This is preferable because you do not have to charge them up or plug them in.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR TRAVELLING! Love it! shave great! only two AAA batteries needed. Goes underwater!!</li>
            <li> Nice and compact. I really like this!</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve just borrowed the husband&#x27;s fancy electric man-shaver for touchups, but it&#x27;s often a hassle if he takes it with him as he travels, sometimes he misplaces it, or just doesn&#x27;t clean it (ick).  Finally broke down &amp; got my own shaver. This one is exactly what I wanted: Don&#x27;t need to plug it in, so it&#x27;s very portable &amp; not bulky. I like that it takes normal batteries and that it&#x27;s NOT rechargeable, since I don&#x27;t need to leave it on a charger cluttering up my bathroom. Since I only use it for a few minutes at a time, maybe once a week-ish, I didn&#x27;t want anything that will take up space or need to worry that it isn&#x27;t charged. The quality of the shave so far is great. I have only used it dry... the description says this is a wet/dray shaver, however upon inspection it does not appear that this is actually water-safe: There is no gasket sealing the battery compartment, so I would caution against immersing this in water. However, I didn&#x27;t plan to ever use it as a wet shaver, so this doesn&#x27;t bug me. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good to have but it&#x27;s pretty much useless for me. I used it twice and now it just sits in my closet. The hair on my legs and under my arms doesn&#x27;t grow that fast, so it really does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> product does what it is suppose to with out any problems so far. Would buy again if the need arose.</li>
            <li> I got this electric razor to use post knee surgery because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use a razor anywhere near the incision for months.  I wasn&#x27;t about to wait that long to shave though and my doctor told me that an electric razor would be ok to use.  It works perfectly for the knee and leg area.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t get as close as a traditional razor but does the job.  I have tried it on my under arms with little to no success.</li>
            <li> I had read several reviews before purchasing but I really like it.  When you are my age, older, you don&#x27;t have that much hair that needs to be removed either under the arms and/or the legs and it works great for me.  I did have a little trouble figuring out where the batteries went and then since my fingers are not so nimble any more it was a little hard to get the back cover off, but once done everything fell in place.  Worth the money, not very expensive and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered Remington because I have a really old women&#x27;s electric Remington that still works well but I can&#x27;t get replacement blades for it anymore.  So I ordered this one hoping to replace my old razor or at lease have a nice one to travel with.  Unfortunately this does not shave closely. I&#x27;m left with stubble even after going over the same spot a few times.  I&#x27;ll stick with my old electric until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Delivered in two days, with prime shipping.  Nice product, perfect for travel, or if you can&#x27;t shave your legs in the shower. Very gentle to the skin.  Easy to use push button on and off. Makes a buzzing noise when on.  I have blond leg hair and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> great little shaver for quick shaving on the go.</li>
            <li> Does good so far like it</li>
            <li> My old $40 rechargeable Remington bit the dust. I read great reviews on this travel shaver here on Amazon and thought I would give it a chance. I&#x27;m actually very shocked at how close it shaved, not as close as a razor, but still great. Also, it shaves as well as my Remington rechargeable shaver did. I thought a more expensive shaver would be better, but this little one is just as good. My only concern is how long it will last in the long run. I will review it again after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Very pleased with it. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Small, reliable, and portable.  I can take it with me wherever I go.  The screen will wear out eventually but my last one lasted over a year, maybe 2.  The battery life is pretty good but I keep spares on hand.  It uses 2 AAA.  The best small shaver I have found.</li>
            <li> I previously have had two Panasonic rechargeable wet/dry shavers, which are twice as expensive. Both stopped working. This one seems more durable, and it certainly works better without clogging or pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> this shaver works well. I like it and I have been using it for over an year now- no problem</li>
            <li> Had a old Remington shaver that needed replacing.  Great price &amp; works just as advertised-- dry or in shower. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Small and sturdy. Easy to use.  Good quality.  So far it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor when I was going in for surgery, and knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily use a blade. In the past, I have purchased much more expensive razors and I was incredibly surprised with this one. The batteries have lasted a very long time, and it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m getting ready for a date in my youth or shaving every other day. Easy to pack when you&#x27;re going away too. I think I will buy another one to keep permanently in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do. Nothing compares to shaving with a regular razor, but this works great in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> Do not get this confused with your regular shaver. It is meant for travel and is a perfect small size. It has one trimmer edge and one shaver head. So while it does a nice job it takes longer than my regular and is not quite ad close but perfectly acceptable for the swimsuit if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver.  The shaver is not very good and the foil itself is useless. The only thing that seemed to shave her hair was the trimmer on either side.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel or everyday use!  Item as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It stop working after the first use! I dont understand what I did to make it stop working but o well!</li>
            <li> Hardly cuts anything. Running it over stubbly skin doesn&#x27;t seem to produce any results. Also, the jagged blade at the edge gave me a nasty nick.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had a hip replacement, since I couldn&#x27;t bend to shave my leg as usual and had to have help.  It worked very well.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a non-electric razor, but I have found that true of all electric razors.  It did the job.  I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver for bikini area I love the angled head makes for a perfect shave! Got all my girlfriends using them too you&#x27;ll never use anything else</li>
            <li> works amazingly well for someone with really sensitive skin like myself, when I can normally only use 1 particular shaver and in the shower. So normally if i decide I want to go to the pool or something but haent shaved, i would have to go have an extra shower first, just to shave with my other shaver..the schick intuition, which is the only one that I had been able to ever use without my legs being red raw and itchy as heck afterwards. This is very gentle on the skin...doesnt always get a close enough shave, but as an emergency shaver, it works really well!</li>
            <li> What a terrific little shaver this is!  It&#x27;s inexpensive, very light, highly packable, seems reasonably long-lived (survived three months of travel, knocking around Europe), and gives a nice, extremely close shave--without pinching or biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in every way superior to my higher priced Remington and Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll buy a bunch of these little gems and store them away as a hedge against the day they will be discontinued!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping. It doesn&#x27;t shave hardly at all. I went over the same area at least 5 times before I could tell it cut any hair. It barely trimmed any hair off after all that trouble. Still had prickles all over. Should have just got the bag of $2 razors, at least they would have shaved the hair off my legs!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A JOKE . I EITHER GOT A LEMON, OR THEIR ALL LIKE THE ONE I RECIEVED . IT NEVER WORKED FROM DAY ONE. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Not heavy duty but ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for our daughter, she&#x27;s 9 but has very hairy legs which she is forever complaining about.  She is also accident prone and wears very strong prescription lenses, so there was no way I wanted her to shave with a razor in the shower.  Anyway I used to have something similar to this when I was in college and it worked rather well for years, and I never once cut myself with it.  So as something of a gag I put it in her stocking marked &amp;#34;from the Elves&amp;#34;.  At first she was shocked, almost appalled really, but a little while later she gets it out, puts batteries in it and asks me if I&#x27;ll show her how to shave her legs.  So we sit down and I show her the different cutting tools on it, she was a little worried that it would hurt, so I shaved my knee cap and had her touch her finger to the foil.  After which she sticks her leg out and says &amp;#34;okay let&#x27;s do this&amp;#34;.  At the very first touch she giggling and wiggling all over, she&#x27;s very ticklish.  So I grabbed ahold of her foot and settle in for torture (yes I am that sort of mother).  After maybe 15 minutes of squealing and giggling we have one leg done, and she volunteers to do the other leg herself.  As she finishes up our youngest comes to see what&#x27;s going on, and we tell her that big sis is learning to shave her legs, which of course leads to the little one begging to learn as well.  So the 9 year old turns to me wiggles her eyebrows and says, &amp;#34;please mom, let me show her&amp;#34;. Followed by much more giggling and squealing...</li>
            <li> I get severe under arm skin irritation and hair bumps with razors or creams so this actually worked better than anything else I have tried. However it does cause some irritation if you keep running it over your skin to try and catch every single hair. It eliminated my problems with ingrown hair bumps which was a huge relief and I like being able to use it in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t give you a really close shave but I don&#x27;t use it on my legs so that doesn&#x27;t really matter for me.  You can still feel some stubble. However for avoiding painful, itchy hair bumps this is a great solution.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that I would like this razor, because all the other one&#x27;s I have ordered haven&#x27;t been good... but I was pleasantly surprised. It works better than most that I have used, and for the size, it&#x27;s really handy. I use it for my legs and bikini area and the first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t get close enough but by the second time, it was very close and smooth. I hope it holds up. Oh, and it didn&#x27;t come to me purple like in the picture. it has little pink flowers on it but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It is small and handy but it really is only good for emergency &#x27;i forgot to shave and am walking out in shorts&#x27; types of situations and only if no one is getting too close to you.  You have to make multiple passes and I can&#x27;t find any way to take it apart to clean it, this drive me nuts.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on anything but legs that&#x27;s for sure!  As I said, it does work for a quickie touch up.</li>
            <li> Blade/metal part rusted after being exposured to watet</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought this little razor for its amazingly low price, and found that it was a winner!  Yippee!&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping too!</li>
            <li> light and travels well. wife love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this razor - it&#x27;s so cute, and the price was certainly right. But as it turns out, you don&#x27;t even get what you pay for. It is pathetically weak and its already minimal power audibly wound down even more during the first shave, after a full charging. And it did not give a close shave; many entire hairs got missed, even over several passes. What a dud.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my tweenage daughter to take to summer camp.  She is new to shaving her underarms and is still a little nervous about handling a razor.  I thought this would be a good solution for while she&#x27;s away.  Upon opening the package, I notice what I assume are the bikini line trimmers on either side of the main shaving head.  I decided to try it first to make sure it would be as safe and easy for her to handle as I had hoped. I&#x27;m an experienced shaver (regular and electric) and nicked myself on the first swipe. It smarted a fair bit and drew a little blood. The shave was close enough for a &amp;#34;quickie,&amp;#34; but not for regular use.  So we settled instead on the Gillette Venus travel razor.  The shorter handle and large thumb and finger pad for holding it gave her the confidence she needed to do the job without worry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than I thought it would be! I&#x27;m very very impressed! My legs are super soft and it was so quick and easy. I had alot of hair on my legs. I&#x27;m single now and really in no rush to show off legs so when my last electric shaver stopped working I didn&#x27;t rush to get a new one. Anyways 3 months growth of leg hair gone in 15 minutes. Haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else yet but I definitely will soon.  To be battery operated, which is the only thing I hate about it, it&#x27;s great and gets the job done. Remington makes The Best shavers hands down. Don&#x27;t understand why anything Panasonic gets better ratings.</li>
            <li> This little shaver didn&#x27;t cost much, but you get what you paid for which isn&#x27;t much of a shaver.  Like the most recent reviewer before me said, it is weak and missed hairs after several passes.  It&#x27;s cute, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to take this on vacation where I was going to wear shorts or outfits that would leave my legs bare because hair would show using this razor.  Spend a little more money on something more powerful.</li>
            <li> I have tried this wet and dry and love it. It cut my shaving time and gave a close shave. I wish it had come with a cleaning brush, but other than that, I love it. It didn&#x27;t irritate my legs when I shaved them dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver to keep in my travel bag.  It was an excellent purchase.  Safe close shave. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Even though this is a wet/dry razor I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it get wet.  It stopped working...when I opened the battery lid, water came out and there was rust in and around the batteries.  The lid was on tight as directed.  Oh well!</li>
            <li> this shavers is perfect for us guys to not just for woman! suggest not using in shower because the insides will rust.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and itÂ´s what I was expecting. Also, it arrived on time and in erfect conditions.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to replace a shaver that finally died after 15 years. This replacement is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size. Works pretty good around the bikini area. It&#x27;s a little awkward with the curves but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact design allows for easy handling especially for those who have arthritic hands. It provides a good close shave but the batteries (if used daily) don&#x27;t last. However, it is great for traveling.</li>
