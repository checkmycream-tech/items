            <li>/&gt;There is a light fragrance</li>

            <li>, It&#x27;s normal if the product is effective..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth to buy!</li>

            <li>but it fades quickly as you work it into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I am so lucky to have found it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and it seems as I&#x27;m getting older, my face is breaking out more and more with my hormones each month.  </li>

            <li>and thanks for the discount</li>
            <li>Iwill try it for 2 week and iwill review again thanks</li>
            <li>she felt like it really works</li>
            <li>really clears skin, exfoliates, and I can see wrinkle reduction on my forhead</li>
            <li>Very liquidy.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>you pump it out and put on fast because its runny</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really get it under control until I got this serum.</li>
            <li>and three it  is advised to use once or twice a week which means it doesn&#x27;t take up too much time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>This serum does so much for the skin, you almost cannot believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is comparable to other similar products and seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up on it the first few times this product seems to be one of those that get better as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I use this product mainly at bed time</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are 20% Vitamin C, 5% Hyalauronic Acid, 2% Salicylic Acid, and 35%Nacinamide.  </li>
            <li>It can be used by men or woman,a teenager or an older person.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a decent product.</li>
            <li>My main problem with this was the size.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to see what long term use of this will do to my skin.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a little bit of stress so that might be why I&#x27;m breaking out more</li>
            <li>I mean, what is NOT to love?!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even put this on my skin, I can&#x27;t trust a product to be safe if the seller clearly lied about the active ingredients when trying to sell the it.</li>
            <li>and I did my makeup as I normally would and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my chest, arms, and face where I normally break out all the time.</li>
            <li>I normally get a gel prescribed by my Dr</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my face after just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li>I would advise to use caution in the sun while using this product because some of the ingredients can make your skin a little more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have acne around my chin and cheeks and any time I use a new product, I get an outbreak.</li>
            <li>but I ran out and needed to schedule a new appointment.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to say, this did not give me an outbreak!</li>
            <li>and I noticed my skin clearing, becoming brighter and firm.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum is exactly what I was looking for to help combat my troublesome breakouts that I have started having recently.</li>
            <li>but I attribute this to the retinol as I have sensitive skin and any new face regimen</li>
            <li>I have been using my serum for 8 days now and can see a positive difference in my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>Really good product from my observations in the past week of testing it out on myself and a couple other people.</li>
            <li>I had a pimple clear up overnight</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has a smell that is conducive to all of the essential oils in the product which is a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li>After using this product only for a week I can see the spots fading and my skin overal looks so much brighter.</li>
            <li>So far I am liking how my face is looking and feeling with this product.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of the serum at once since you can really get your entire face and neck with a pump two pumps at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no harsh smell when you put t on.</li>
            <li>It is completely versatile and productive.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking hydrated, feels smooth, less red and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>so I am not able to tell if it can repair damaged skin or reverse the signs of aging, but I can say that my skin feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>I do have dry skin along with some fine lines/wrinkles and redness due to rubbing my face with towel during workouts.  </li>
            <li>I have used my product daily, though you can use it twice a week or less depending on your unique skin type as per directions on bottle.  </li>
            <li>Its a milky, liquid and applies easy and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>but it does apply easy and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t enjoy this product because it left my skin feeling very tight and dry, although my face did look shiny for a couple of hours throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It has been about a week of daily application of this serum right before sleep, and im starting to notice a couple of red bumps on face recently.</li>
            <li>I have occasional bouts of adult acne.</li>
            <li>My face (which is used to retinol) is more broken out after a week of use than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li>product is made in the USA and is backed with a full refund guarantee in the instance that you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li>, 20% C + E Professional Topical Facial Skin Care Helps Repair Sun Damage,</li>
            <li>great!she said,it feels a little bit burning when she first tried it and for her</li>
            <li>This little bottle has many applications as you only use a little each time so it should last you a while.</li>
            <li>It can also be used in combination with other vitamin C or skin care products, but I am not sure that it is necessary since this has so many key components to making your skin look and feel healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out a little thicker than many serums, so a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this serum not only is for aged skin but has salicylic acid to help keep your skin clear.</li>

            <li> she felt like it really works</li>
            <li> really clears skin, exfoliates, and I can see wrinkle reduction on my forhead</li>
            <li> Very liquidy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> you pump it out and put on fast because its runny</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t really get it under control until I got this serum.</li>
            <li> and three it  is advised to use once or twice a week which means it doesn&#x27;t take up too much time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li> This serum does so much for the skin, you almost cannot believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to other similar products and seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up on it the first few times this product seems to be one of those that get better as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this product mainly at bed time</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are 20% Vitamin C, 5% Hyalauronic Acid, 2% Salicylic Acid, and 35%Nacinamide.  </li>
            <li> It can be used by men or woman,a teenager or an older person.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a decent product.</li>
            <li> My main problem with this was the size.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to see what long term use of this will do to my skin.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a little bit of stress so that might be why I&#x27;m breaking out more</li>
            <li> I mean, what is NOT to love?!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even put this on my skin, I can&#x27;t trust a product to be safe if the seller clearly lied about the active ingredients when trying to sell the it.</li>
            <li> and I did my makeup as I normally would and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my chest, arms, and face where I normally break out all the time.</li>
            <li> I normally get a gel prescribed by my Dr</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my face after just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I would advise to use caution in the sun while using this product because some of the ingredients can make your skin a little more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have acne around my chin and cheeks and any time I use a new product, I get an outbreak.</li>
            <li> but I ran out and needed to schedule a new appointment.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to say, this did not give me an outbreak!</li>
            <li> and I noticed my skin clearing, becoming brighter and firm.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum is exactly what I was looking for to help combat my troublesome breakouts that I have started having recently.</li>
            <li> but I attribute this to the retinol as I have sensitive skin and any new face regimen</li>
            <li> I have been using my serum for 8 days now and can see a positive difference in my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> Really good product from my observations in the past week of testing it out on myself and a couple other people.</li>
            <li> I had a pimple clear up overnight</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has a smell that is conducive to all of the essential oils in the product which is a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li> After using this product only for a week I can see the spots fading and my skin overal looks so much brighter.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking how my face is looking and feeling with this product.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of the serum at once since you can really get your entire face and neck with a pump two pumps at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no harsh smell when you put t on.</li>
            <li> It is completely versatile and productive.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking hydrated, feels smooth, less red and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> so I am not able to tell if it can repair damaged skin or reverse the signs of aging, but I can say that my skin feels smooth.  </li>
            <li> I do have dry skin along with some fine lines/wrinkles and redness due to rubbing my face with towel during workouts.  </li>
            <li> I have used my product daily, though you can use it twice a week or less depending on your unique skin type as per directions on bottle.  </li>
            <li> Its a milky, liquid and applies easy and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but it does apply easy and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t enjoy this product because it left my skin feeling very tight and dry, although my face did look shiny for a couple of hours throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It has been about a week of daily application of this serum right before sleep, and im starting to notice a couple of red bumps on face recently.</li>
            <li> I have occasional bouts of adult acne.</li>
            <li> My face (which is used to retinol) is more broken out after a week of use than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> product is made in the USA and is backed with a full refund guarantee in the instance that you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> , 20% C + E Professional Topical Facial Skin Care Helps Repair Sun Damage,</li>
            <li> great!she said,it feels a little bit burning when she first tried it and for her</li>
            <li> This little bottle has many applications as you only use a little each time so it should last you a while.</li>
            <li> It can also be used in combination with other vitamin C or skin care products, but I am not sure that it is necessary since this has so many key components to making your skin look and feel healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes out a little thicker than many serums, so a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this serum not only is for aged skin but has salicylic acid to help keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and opaque and the smell is clean.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of serum to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> and I used it under my concealer and it helped reduce its appearance a little bit from what I can tell because I don&#x27;t normally put anything under there except the concealer.</li>
            <li> but my skin has been peeling dramatically to a point that its causing uneven skin tone with dark patches formed right under the affected areas.</li>
            <li> I dont think ive written any review on amazon for the past numerous years as an active member, but this is the only one product that I was really getting pissed off about.</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of this product and am not easily impressed.</li>
            <li> By evening the next day my complexion appeared smoother less red and healthier and looked glowing.</li>
            <li> I have a moderately blemished face due to acne in my teens, so I was hoping this serum would help me out with the scars.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with redness/irritation or any other negative side effects while using this product daily.  </li>
            <li> try a bit harder,</li>
            <li> Wonder Skin Clearing Serum is a milky colored serum that is not really a cream or gel, somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I am extremely upset with this item and have no clue how this got 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with some other Radha products for about a week</li>
            <li> I have dark circles that are hereditary</li>
            <li> ive gone under accutane and not even the peeling from the drug gave me the dark patches as described.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the bottle would not last a long time since it is only .5 fl oz, since the amount I have to use is so small the bottle should last for a while.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from break outs and dark spots from scarring.</li>
            <li> Since this is the only thing I have added to my routine lately, it must get the credit.</li>
            <li> The redness in my face has also calmed down.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to the serum though it is not offensive.</li>
            <li> For example apply it once a day, or two times a week, or less often.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months and have see no  difference in my skin or less breakouts</li>
            <li> and today I pumped some product and found A dead ant in there.</li>
            <li> I started using it a few days ago and applied it twice a day once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arms and my chest have not broken out nearly as bad as they used to.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use I&#x27;ve already seen a few results!</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle</li>
            <li> 1- Smells exactly like the bar of soap laying on the floor of the worst motel</li>
            <li> I tried this not knowing if it would work or not and took a gamble on whether it would make my condition worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just small,and a bit expensive</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and not itchy at all..</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Disappointed with this product. Been using it for a few months and have see no  difference in my skin or less breakouts and today I pumped some product and found A dead ant in there. Will never purchase this again. Would have never bought if I knew what I know now.</li>
            <li> With retinol is good!</li>
            <li> This is a very good serum for my face. I have acne around my chin and cheeks and any time I use a new product, I get an outbreak. I am surprised to say, this did not give me an outbreak! I have dark circles that are hereditary and I used it under my concealer and it helped reduce its appearance a little bit from what I can tell because I don&#x27;t normally put anything under there except the concealer. Very satisfied with this product. Great consistency and goes on sheer. No white residue from what I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and it seems as I&#x27;m getting older, my face is breaking out more and more with my hormones each month.  This serum works great and has kept my face clear for a week since I received it.  I am glad that I purchased the product!</li>
            <li> Really good product from my observations in the past week of testing it out on myself and a couple other people. Fast delivery, recommended!</li>
            <li> They should sell it in bigger bottles. I felt like it was working but I ran out in about 4-5 days. I could have been more conservative with my use, but if you use it twice a day I don&#x27;t see how it could last more than 10 days.</li>
            <li> 1- Smells exactly like the bar of soap laying on the floor of the worst motel bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;2- Label is crooked and janky. Also, it looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint..try a bit harder, whatever No Name company you are.&lt;br /&gt;3- My face (which is used to retinol) is more broken out after a week of use than it&#x27;s been in years. Works as well as it smells and looks...not at all.&lt;br /&gt;All views are honest and my very own. I paid for this crap. I may be the only reviewer that wasn&#x27;t given a sample of this product in order to review it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this serum not only is for aged skin but has salicylic acid to help keep your skin clear. And it does as described. I have occasional bouts of adult acne. Since using this serum,  I&#x27;ve had none. The redness in my face has also calmed down. My skin looks good and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a discount on this product for sharing my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> love this product. and thanks for the discount</li>
            <li> Great !! My face feel so good  and look better  !!&lt;br /&gt;Smell great too ..  Iwill try it for 2 week and iwill review again thanks</li>
            <li> I dont think ive written any review on amazon for the past numerous years as an active member, but this is the only one product that I was really getting pissed off about. It has been about a week of daily application of this serum right before sleep, and im starting to notice a couple of red bumps on face recently. I have a moderately blemished face due to acne in my teens, so I was hoping this serum would help me out with the scars. I cannot say whether this actually help me with the acne scar or not but my skin has been peeling dramatically to a point that its causing uneven skin tone with dark patches formed right under the affected areas. I am extremely upset with this item and have no clue how this got 5 star rating. For people who are looking for acne blemish serum, this is NOT recommended by me at all.&lt;br /&gt;P.S ive gone under accutane and not even the peeling from the drug gave me the dark patches as described.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.. she got one already and tested.. she started to love it coz she felt like it really works great!she said,it feels a little bit burning when she first tried it and for her, It&#x27;s normal if the product is effective..it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and not itchy at all.. It&#x27;s just small,and a bit expensive but it&#x27;s worth to buy! They shipped super fast too..</li>
            <li> This product has become one of my best friends. I was suffering from break outs and dark spots from scaring and this product helped clear my skin, it was incredible. It does have a hint of tea tree oil scent to it but it fades quickly as you work it into the skin. Its a milky, liquid and applies easy and a little goes a long way! I used this product along with some other Radha products for about a week and I noticed my skin clearing, becoming brighter and firm. I use this product mainly at bed time and I am so lucky to have found it. My skin is very temperamental and can easily break out from products but this product did none of that, I was extremely happy to find a product my skin loved. I will definitely continue to use this and always keep one on the shelf, please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this!! This review is 100% my own, honest opinion as I did receive this product for free.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only because it claimed having 2.5 % retinol. However, when I received the serum, there&#x27;s no mention of retinol anywhere on the label. I won&#x27;t even put this on my skin, I can&#x27;t trust a product to be safe if the seller clearly lied about the active ingredients when trying to sell the it.</li>
            <li> This is another one of the good products from this company. I have bought a bunch of their products and they are always at a decent price with good ingredients. This product is no different. I don&#x27;t have acne so I cannot speak on the effectiveness on pimples. This Vitamin C serum goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I received the item for review but since this serum has Vitamin C and retinol, I basically kill two birds with one stone. It goes on thin and opaque and the smell is clean. It quickly penetrated the skin and I did my makeup as I normally would and didn&#x27;t feel that this serum made my skin oily or made my makeup behave differently. When I use it at night, I feel my face tingling but I attribute this to the retinol as I have sensitive skin and any new face regimen makes my skin react. Overall, I would recommend to everyone, and although I received the item to review, I will continue to purchase and this will be added to my routine.</li>
            <li> really clears skin, exfoliates, and I can see wrinkle reduction on my forhead</li>
            <li> Wonder Skin Clearing Serum is a milky colored serum that is not really a cream or gel, somewhere in between. I have sensitive skin and I have noticed no redness or irritation from using this product. I have only been using it for a few days so I am not able to tell if it can repair damaged skin or reverse the signs of aging, but I can say that my skin feels smooth.  It only takes a small amount of serum to cover my whole face.

The main ingredients are 20% Vitamin C, 5% Hyalauronic Acid, 2% Salicylic Acid, and 35%Nacinamide.  This product is comparable to other similar products and seems to be a good value. I like that the directions state that you can get the results you want by using according to what skin needs. For example apply it once a day, or two times a week, or less often. This product is made in the USA. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to keep their skin looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this item to suit a review. After 3 days of use I&#x27;ve already seen a few results! I had a pimple clear up overnight and my pores seem smaller on my nose already. It has a smell that is conducive to all of the essential oils in the product which is a very earthy smell. Not a bad smell. I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my chest, arms, and face where I normally break out all the time. My arms and my chest have not broken out nearly as bad as they used to. The bags under my eyes have lightened a great deal as well. The smell is not over powering like most facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Love it A+++++ product</li>
            <li> Message to Manufacturer / seller,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change your Amazon Advertisement immediately. Your product doesn&#x27;t contain retinol. I will be reporting this.</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of this product and am not easily impressed. I was using several different products layered to get all the ingredients that this one product has! I was suffering from break outs and dark spots from scarring. After using this product only for a week I can see the spots fading and my skin overal looks so much brighter. The consistency is a  milky liquid, which I was pretty suprised when for most serums are a gel but it does apply easy and a little goes a long way! Will definitely continue to use this and I&#x27;m so excited to see what long term use of this will do to my skin. I received this product free for testing purposes, however my opinion is 100% unbiased and is my own.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t enjoy this product because it left my skin feeling very tight and dry, although my face did look shiny for a couple of hours throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Really good for the skin and the texture feels nice. I have never tried vitamin C until I got this serum. I thing is a great product and even tho  I got this product for free  would definitely  buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> Works good but doesn&#x27;t come out in a nice way.  Very liquidy. I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but it made me break out :-(</li>
            <li> My Vitamin C arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. So far I am liking how my face is looking and feeling with this product. It is smoother, softer, and I have a more consistently even skin tone and complexion than I had before. Since this is the only thing I have added to my routine lately, it must get the credit. I can get used to this... :-)</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a serum and must say I am very impressed. It is a small bottle you pump it out and put on fast because its runny but it dries fast and feels good. makes my oily skin drier and softer. has a different smell to it not quite used to yet but seems to be doing what it says. my skin feels great.  would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum is exactly what I was looking for to help combat my troublesome breakouts that I have started having recently. I&#x27;ve been through a little bit of stress so that might be why I&#x27;m breaking out more and I couldn&#x27;t really get it under control until I got this serum. This serum is super easy to use one because it comes in a pump bottle so no more wasting any of the valuable serum two it absorbs into my skin nicely and three it  is advised to use once or twice a week which means it doesn&#x27;t take up too much time. I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell with this serum so for those who have problems with scents you should be okay. You also don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of the serum at once since you can really get your entire face and neck with a pump two pumps at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum after I have put on both the Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum ( [[ASIN:B00G75X158 Vitamin C Serum for Face with Hyaluronic Acid, 20% C + E Professional Topical Facial Skin Care Helps Repair Sun Damage, Fade Age Spots, Dark Circles, Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines BEST ORGANIC - 1 oz.]] ) and the Vitamin C Toner ( [[ASIN:B00YYURAJ6 Pure Body Naturals - Vitamin C Toner - 4 Fl 0z]] ) which are both also from Pure Body Naturals and all three products work extremely well together and make my skin feel and look better then it ever has! I would definitely recommend this Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I like how smooth it goes on. there is no sticky feeling,and can be worn under make or alone. It has helped with the fine lines I have. I see a brighter looking completion. It can be used by men or woman,a teenager or an older person. There is no harsh smell when you put t on. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  with the pump you can get the right amount you need wit out wasting it. I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea which causes some redness on my face when it flares up. I normally get a gel prescribed by my Dr but I ran out and needed to schedule a new appointment. I tried this not knowing if it would work or not and took a gamble on whether it would make my condition worse. I started using it a few days ago and applied it twice a day once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I did not see any changes, the second time again... no changes. By evening the next day my complexion appeared smoother less red and healthier and looked glowing. Don&#x27;t give up on it the first few times this product seems to be one of those that get better as you continue to use it. Being a natural redhead I have very fair skin and a lot of freckles. This did not lighten my feckles but then I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles so I cannot comment on that either.&lt;br /&gt;There is a light fragrance but it isn&#x27;t strong or bothersome.It does make my skin tingle at first but once it gets absorbed it goes away. I do use this under my make-up and it doesn&#x27;t have any effect to my foundation. I would advise to use caution in the sun while using this product because some of the ingredients can make your skin a little more sensitive. This little bottle has many applications as you only use a little each time so it should last you a while.I got this at a reduced price to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a decent product. My main problem with this was the size. I don&#x27;t know if I received a sample but it was pretty small. However, I will say it did make my face look brighter. It moisturized as well. My skin felt very smooth after putting this on, especially if I did my weekend regimen (scrub, mask, and then serum).</li>
            <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum by Pure Body Naturals and I really love it. I mean, what is NOT to love?! It has NINETEEN products in one serum! How awesome is that? No animals were harmed in the making of this product because it was not tested on animals! It is all natural and organic and is jam packed with all the best ingredients to work wonders on your skin! It can also be used in combination with other vitamin C or skin care products, but I am not sure that it is necessary since this has so many key components to making your skin look and feel healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is in an easy to use pump bottle. It comes out a little thicker than many serums, so a little will go a long way. It is a very creamy looking, yellow serum that absorbs into your skin very quickly. This serum does so much for the skin, you almost cannot believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It clears skin of blemishes. All blemishes can be improved with this one serum. It not only cleans out pores, but it clears skin. It reduces redness, repairs scars, and prevents breakouts. It soothes skin, and helps to smooth skin out by plumping and hydrating wrinkles and fine lines. It not only protects you from UV but reverses sun damage already done to the skin. I love that it can be used for teens, adults and the elderly. It can be used by both men and women. It is completely versatile and productive. You will notice a difference in your skin when using this product. I use it three times a week and my husband uses it twice a week. We both are noticing healthier, better and younger looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the USA and is backed with a full refund guarantee in the instance that you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C 2 in 1 Skin Clearing Serum with Retinol is amazing.  I have been using my serum for 8 days now and can see a positive difference in my facial skin.  This product comes in a a elegant looking bottle with a pump dispenser.  I have used my product daily, though you can use it twice a week or less depending on your unique skin type as per directions on bottle.  I just gently apply 1 or 2 pumps on my clean face after using a toner and before I use a moisturizer.  This serum states it is highly effective when used in conjunction with a Vitamin C Skin Toner.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with redness/irritation or any other negative side effects while using this product daily.  I do have dry skin along with some fine lines/wrinkles and redness due to rubbing my face with towel during workouts.  My skin is looking hydrated, feels smooth, less red and soft to the touch.  I am also using it on my neck area for wrinkles and it is leaving it smooth.  The serum goes on smoothly, dries quickly and does not leave a greasy residue or feeling.  I will keep on using my serum to see the positive benefits with continued use.  Great product at a great price, especially with the lifetime guarantee money back if you are not happy with the product, so you have nothing to risk with trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my product in return for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> This comes in a jar with a pump and a cap on it. It has a 2 year shelf life. It is a milky soft substance that goes on smoothly. It makes your face feel soft. I love the feel of my face after just a few days of using it. I received this at a reduced price. I am leaving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
