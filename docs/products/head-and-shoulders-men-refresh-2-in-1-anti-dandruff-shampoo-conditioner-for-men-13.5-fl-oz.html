            <li>This is a very good product</li>
            <li>My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my hair (and I&#x27;m in my 60s).</li>
            <li>it just works great for me with flakes.</li>
            <li>This is great for hair and dandruff.</li>
            <li>Works as it should, smells good.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite shampoo from now on!</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner is awesome, it leaves a cool sensation after used, just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Also has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and at a good price!</li>
            <li>Now I can feel confident when discussing my innermost feelings with Counselor Troi.</li>
            <li>more dandruf.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i got this from amazon</li>
            <li>i saved some money, i do better buyin from amazon then goin to the store.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling fresh and it goes on with a nice tingle.</li>
            <li>Love the change of pace of mint and the cool feeling I get &#x27;sometimes&#x27;.</li>
            <li>because I love the cool scent of mint.  </li>
            <li>Helped get rid of my dandruff extremely quickly!</li>
            <li>I accidentally purchased the shampoo with conditioner one day and liked it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I bought this shampoo for about a 1/5th of the price of the Paul Mitchell stuff and honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>Sometimes generics are okay, but the brand name wins for dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo was good, but not worth that kind of money.</li>
            <li>Overall, a pleasant product that seems to keep my flakes at bay.</li>
            <li>this got rid of my major dandruff problem quick in one week it smelled good</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and if you have short hair or use a big dollop, you may feel the coolness of the mint on your skin.</li>
            <li>A good change up with your other products.</li>
            <li>It has menthol scent that really makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and I feel really clean and refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li>No expensive salon products for me.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with all in one shampoo/conditioner is that if seems like you have to put some more conditioner on after your rinse.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t deliver the same amount of intensity of tingle as the Paul Mitchell stuff (which is why I gave it four stars, but if I could I would give it like a 4.5), but you still feel that refreshing mint and tingle</li>
            <li>Nothing like selsum blue but price was good but will probably order something else next time.</li>
            <li>if you want your dandruff gone fast and iching gone this is the product.</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of the original Head &amp; Shoulders...</li>
            <li>As long as there is no price premium, I will continue to purchase this variety over the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this works so much better for me than the other products I have tried from Head &amp; Shoulders, but I&#x27;m glad I found</li>
            <li>Personally, I find it no different than the original, except that it has a musky scent... not quite like cologne, but it&#x27;s not fruity like so many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>New product that works as stated.</li>
            <li>and i just used the whole bottle just to make shore it wont come back</li>
            <li>All you would need for a complete shampoo in one bottle.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tingle at all. Nothing like selsum blue but price was good but will probably order something else next time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! It has menthol scent that really makes me feel clean. My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my hair (and I&#x27;m in my 60s). No expensive salon products for me. I use this as shampoo and body wash. It&#x27;s gentle and I feel really clean and refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the original Head &amp; Shoulders... it just works great for me with flakes. I accidentally purchased the shampoo with conditioner one day and liked it so much, I stayed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this item, Head &amp; Shoulders for men. Personally, I find it no different than the original, except that it has a musky scent... not quite like cologne, but it&#x27;s not fruity like so many other shampoos. I equate it to a bar of Zest soap. Just enough to wake you up in the shower, but not enough to stick around afterwards. As long as there is no price premium, I will continue to purchase this variety over the original.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle to the scalp. The smell is wonderful and if you have short hair or use a big dollop, you may feel the coolness of the mint on your skin.

            <li> Works as it should, smells good.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the sonic showers on the enterprise go down or they just don&#x27;t do enough to get rid of dandruff. The men&#x27;s head and shoulder dandruff shampoo does the trick though. It leaves my hair feeling fresh and it goes on with a nice tingle. Now I can feel confident when discussing my innermost feelings with Counselor Troi.</li>
            <li> this got rid of my major dandruff problem quick in one week it smelled good and i just used the whole bottle just to make shore it wont come back it has bean one year and it has not come back. i hated also tried a lot of other things but they smelled ban and just made it worse. if you want your dandruff gone fast and iching gone this is the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband...and I tried it...because I love the cool scent of mint.  Here on the Tropic of Cancer we take our &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; wherever we can find it.  What is it that makes this a &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; thing?  My voice didn&#x27;t get deeper....I haven&#x27;t grown a moustache....I&#x27;ve still got 2 X chromosomes. If anything changes i&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is awesome, it leaves a cool sensation after used, just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes. This has become my favorite shampoo from now on!</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo after paying a ridiculous $30 for the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo. The shampoo was good, but not worth that kind of money. I&#x27;ve always used Head and Shoulders (read: literally for about four or five years now) and have always been impressed. I sought that clean, tingly feeling, but every other shampoo that tingles is ridiculously expensive, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought this shampoo for about a 1/5th of the price of the Paul Mitchell stuff and honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But I was thankfully proven wrong and I&#x27;m in love. It doesn&#x27;t deliver the same amount of intensity of tingle as the Paul Mitchell stuff (which is why I gave it four stars, but if I could I would give it like a 4.5), but you still feel that refreshing mint and tingle all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I got two of these bottles for less than half the price the bottle of Paul Mitchell I previously bought, I&#x27;m more than happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tingling!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes generics are okay, but the brand name wins for dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog uses the other stuff now.</li>
            <li> New product that works as stated. Head feels refreshed after use. All you would need for a complete shampoo in one bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  It keeps the dandruff away.</li>
            <li> Used the standard before. Then tried the men&#x27;s and it works the same but has a fresher feel with the added menthol. Works best with my hair.  It took me a while to find a hair product that would work.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Has a tingle that the other ones don&#x27;t. I found it annoying</li>
            <li> This is great for hair and dandruff. We have no issues with it. I would recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this works so much better for me than the other products I have tried from Head &amp; Shoulders, but I&#x27;m glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;No more dandruf. No more dry scalp. No more wirery, dry hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i got this from amazon i saved some money, i do better buyin from amazon then goin to the store.</li>
            <li> Helped get rid of my dandruff extremely quickly! Also has a nice scent to it as well. 2 bottles came in one package for me.</li>
