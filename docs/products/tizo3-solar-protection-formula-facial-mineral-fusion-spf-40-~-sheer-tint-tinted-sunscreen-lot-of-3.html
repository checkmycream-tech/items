            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I live in a tropical area and the humidity doesn&#x27;t affect the product at all - I also tend to have oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and affective.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that they didn&#x27;t send me the right tinted one as the package didn&#x27;t mention it being tinted</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tizo3 for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other sunscreen.</li>

            <li> Stays on and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird white film on your face like other products.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Feels like silk going on, just enough cold that foundation it not needed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have oily skin so the matte look is awesome and it stays on all day.  I actually use it as a foundation when I&#x27;m just out and about.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth, not greasy, can be used as a councealer and really protects the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I have used it under reaaally kinda extreme conditions and it still works as expected. This means walking under dessert  sun (Vegas and canyons) for hours. I get sunspots on my face easily and with this sunscreen I haven&#x27;t (still not tested on water though).&lt;br /&gt;I love also the fact that its consistency or something, helps my makeup to last whole office work day as just applied.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. My dermatologist was happy when I told her I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  I especially like the fact that it&#x27;s tinted and protects me from sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly when I needed it the most.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for my skiin and for daily use because I dont need to put makeup if  If i dont want.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; evenly. Lasts all day. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li> Omg, I&#x27;m in love with this product!  I read all of the reviews and I will say that I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I was a little concerned that they didn&#x27;t send me the right tinted one as the package didn&#x27;t mention it being tinted and it wasn&#x27;t until I opened the product and squeezed some out that I knew it was the right one (why do they not print on the package which is tinted and which is clear???).  I&#x27;ve been so impressed by how light it feels on my skin and the matte finish (it even manages to make my pores disappear!) that I&#x27;ve been letting all of my friends sample mine.  Worth. Every. Single. Penny.</li>
            <li> Use it for foundation at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4-5 years now and absolutely will not use anything else!  Stays on and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird white film on your face like other products. I live in a tropical area and the humidity doesn&#x27;t affect the product at all - I also tend to have oily skin but this will not slick off after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> wife loves it; happy wife, happy life</li>
            <li> Have used it for years!  Recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk going on, just enough cold that foundation it not needed. Stays on well. Strong SPF coverage. Used it for years now. Would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day in addition to Kimberly sayer ultra light facial moisturizer spf30 so my face is well protected. I like the tint to help give me some color and to even out my skin tone. I have sensitive skin (prone to acne) and this has not caused me any problems over the past few years of use. It is expensive but lasts a long time and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen I use. My doctor recommended</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love.  Good product!!  I also thought the price was not bad either.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Use this daily, under foundation.  It really works to block out sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  Have been using it for about 4 years now, and love it.  Color blends with any skin color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens so getting this one was a great find.  It feels so soft and I just put Sephora mineral powder on top of it and I&#x27;m out of the house. It dries so quickly. I use just a little bit on my face and I wear a wide brimmed hat.</li>
            <li> Light weight product with a nice satin finish on your skin. The slight tight helps to conceal tonal flaws. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the lightweight formula and the slight tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tizo3 for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other sunscreen. It&#x27;s natural and affective. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Smooths fine lines, no need for makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it. Not greasy and lasts most of the day!</li>
            <li> Does not settle in wrinkles but has some coverage and sunscreen</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s silky smooth and blends in with my skin colour. It&#x27;s not greasy, there&#x27;s no smell and it doesn&#x27;t wash away in sweat. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, very light and long lasting.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or shine after a few hours.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Had bought some in a doctor&#x27;s office for an exaggerated price.  What I was able to get on Amazon was for a third of the price I paid before.</li>

            <li> Excellent product.  Quick shipping. Perfectly described.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for quite a while. This is my daily foundation and it protects against the solar rays.</li>
