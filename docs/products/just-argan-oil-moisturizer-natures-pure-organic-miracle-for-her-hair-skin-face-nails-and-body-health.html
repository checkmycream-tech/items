            <li>My skin stays more moisturized when I do this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Argan oil to my family and friends so they can use this wonderful oil and be able to have the same experience as me.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this after hearing about how amazing Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li>and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in homemade conditioners, and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>The benefits have been wonderful, it absorbs quickly and my skin looks smooth and feels soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also been very good as a carrier oil for  aromatherapy and it helps my hair,nails and skin at the same time!  </li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s great with her hair, which is great too, but it really does well with dry skin.</li>
            <li>After 2 months, my hair is shiny and strong.  </li>
            <li>I have loved my Just Argan Oil since the very beginning when I first purchased it!</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any questions, but I thought it was a great personal touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oil to help smooth everything out</li>
            <li>More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.</li>
            <li>I put it on first then put lotion over the top.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on dry skin as well, I have been using Argan Oil on my heels and it is working!</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a cool design</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Some worked okay, and others not so much.</li>
            <li>and this has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With so many natural uses for this oil and seeing first hand the amazing effects of using this product I highly recommend Just Argon Oil by Natures Life Oils.</li>
            <li>It is much softer, looks smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>She is in love with this stuff, it makes her hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 2 months now and have very much enjoyed the experience thus far.  </li>
            <li>The truth is, a lot of the other Argan Oils being sold on Amazon are basically the same, so I might as well go with the one that looks the best.  </li>
            <li>but it also keeps your hair healthy and strong” but being a teen she only cared about how cute it made her hair look. :</li>
            <li>The price is right too; will be ordering again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is right for all the things it does and my bottle seems full still even after how much I use it.</li>
            <li>It penetrates the skin very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed a little bit and told her “</li>
            <li>Love it wish it would go back on sale.</li>
            <li>but it fades fast and does not linger after the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face and neck soft and smooth with no greasy aftermath.</li>
            <li>this oil really helps!</li>
            <li>Funny reason, but</li>
            <li>It is my first attempt</li>
            <li>next day I noticed that her arm looked a lot better.</li>
            <li>how powerful this stuff really</li>
            <li>would recommended this oil to anyone who wants softer, healthier looking hair and skin!</li>
            <li>I will be a long time user of Just Aragan Oil, most certainly!</li>
            <li>and she came back in super excited about how it removed all of her</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s oil offers more for the dollar and has worked well thus far.</li>
            <li>I have damaged hair and I love that this oil helps my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li>However we will use medical products when we feel a little more potent a remedy is needed (accepting whatever side effects medications may have).  </li>
            <li>it is much softer and seems to look healthier.  </li>
            <li>so I have been mixing it into a moisturizer and have noticed that they do not scratch as much.</li>
            <li>really like the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple of drops really hydrates my skin and leaves it softer for hours longer than just lotion</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because i really like how it works and feels on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>While it may sound unmanly to say such a thing, I don&#x27;t like having my hands literally cracked and bleeding all the time.  </li>
            <li>This Just Argan Oil has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I really like the oil; not to heavy and soaks into your skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is the real stuff which also means you can use a lot less of it and get the same results you&#x27;ve more then likely been spending a lot more for (i.e. I know I was).</li>
            <li>My hair breaks less and is more shiny.</li>
            <li>It has so many uses and is one of natures little miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>I also love using the product as a &amp;#34;booster&amp;#34; in my everyday hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li>I find new uses for it every day.</li>
            <li>She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves nails and skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried several hair smoothing serums in the past and just haven&#x27;t seen the kind of results I&#x27;ve wanted.</li>
            <li>wife has had an eczema rash on her arm for a long time and nothing she has tried even remotely helped the rash or making her feel better about herself.</li>
            <li>I add just a few drops to my face lotion and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft, never oily.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft without leaving any oil appearance.</li>
            <li>has helped restore her soft baby skin.</li>
            <li>She has pretty dry skin and a couple drops of the oil</li>
            <li>Having paid a lot more for a similar product that actually gave me less</li>
            <li>high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li>There are a few reasons I like this one better than any other I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results in my skin as well as my skin of my young son, who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly surprised at my results after only 1 treatment.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very big into organic and natural products and supplements.  </li>
            <li>I had tried the more expensive brand of Argan Oil and really loved it, but the cost was a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice with this product is that this isn&#x27;t some watered down, stepped on version of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>She has seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of her hair</li>
            <li>I have seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li>She was very skeptical at first, but then was very excited after she saw the results of using Just Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly, but DRY hair...</li>
            <li>Amy had been looking for something to help with her son&#x27;s eczema for a while because nothing she had tried previously had helped much.</li>

            <li> high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons I like this one better than any other I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the results in my skin as well as my skin of my young son, who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly surprised at my results after only 1 treatment.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very big into organic and natural products and supplements.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the more expensive brand of Argan Oil and really loved it, but the cost was a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice with this product is that this isn&#x27;t some watered down, stepped on version of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> She has seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of her hair</li>
            <li> I have seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li> She was very skeptical at first, but then was very excited after she saw the results of using Just Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly, but DRY hair...</li>
            <li> Amy had been looking for something to help with her son&#x27;s eczema for a while because nothing she had tried previously had helped much.</li>
            <li> So far, I prefer this type of oil over other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry skin (especially working in the field as I do with concrete and other construction materials).  </li>
            <li> It helps as much if not more than the medicated stuff</li>
            <li> have also been using this oil before my hand cream, especially around my cuticles, where they get irritated and dry from washing my hands a lot at work, and have seen a definite improvement in how long they stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> have very dry cuticles and the same for my feet</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have any strange effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first oil I&#x27;ve used that has actually restored my broken, straw-like hair ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my curly hair before my other hair products, and it has worked really well at keeping the frizz down without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> also received some other tips about using this argan oil from the seller, which I will be trying out next.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils I&#x27;ve used for dry skin, Argan Oil actually soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of hair, that was getting dry.</li>
            <li> His hands were dry and cracking and nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helping my husband&#x27;s dry itchy rash on his leg.</li>
            <li> Then I began using it on my legs for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair,my face and any dry areas on me.</li>
            <li> I have recently gone from a brunette to a blonde and my hair has gone through a few chemical treatments.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Just Argan oil for a little while and have been happier with this oil than the one in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the goat, and found out that goats like to eat argan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few argan oils that are triple extra virgin.</li>
            <li> A little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I am willing to put up with the smell to have a 100% organic product without fake perfumes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand of Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I started adding a few drops of the oil to his medicated ointment and within just a few days, his hands were no longer red and tender and the cracking and peeling is GONE!</li>
            <li> It is not taking the spots away but has made it less itchy...</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and I use lotion less than I used to.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit heavier, so you use may use less.</li>
            <li> And it only takes a few drops on my shoulder length, medium thick</li>
            <li> and I let her use a little bit just to see what would happen</li>
            <li> Less itch means less crying!</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a few oils, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help without applying it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops shines my hair!</li>
            <li> Mixing argan oil with his creams we&#x27;ve used in the past, and his skin has cleared up a ton.</li>
            <li> Less time in the heat is helping my hair to heal and have fewer broken ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days you can hardly tell that there was even a rash there.</li>
            <li> There are very few things that help with my hair, and I have tried alot!</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatic improvements as I&#x27;ve combined his medicated lotion, with the argan oil-</li>
            <li> and I can tell a difference if I fail to use the product.  </li>
            <li> My ends dont go crazy when i style my hair</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this! I add just a few drops to my face lotion and it makes a huge difference. I am a customer for life :)</li>
            <li> Love it wish it would go back on sale. I even got a call from the sellers with information and different uses for this oil.</li>
            <li> Have had this product for close to two weeks and so far so good!  I have been using it on my hair and I definitely notice a difference ...it is much softer and seems to look healthier.  It does a great job on dry skin as well, I have been using Argan Oil on my heels and it is working!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this oil that I feel it deserves it. It has helped my hair and my children&#x27;s skin. I have damaged hair and I love that this oil helps my hair dry faster. Less time in the heat is helping my hair to heal and have fewer broken ends. My kids have  eczema so I have been mixing it into a moisturizer and have noticed that they do not scratch as much. It is not taking the spots away but has made it less itchy... which is all I truly care about. Less itch means less crying! I would recommend this product. The price is right for all the things it does and my bottle seems full still even after how much I use it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Just Argan Oil for about a month now and I love it!  It has softened the skin on my heels and elbows and strengthened my nails. My son and I both have eczema, and while it hasn&#x27;t taken it away, Just Argan Oil has definitely reduced the redness and minimized the itching for both of us.  I love this brand and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of hair, that was getting dry. She is in love with this stuff, it makes her hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it on my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil by Natures Life&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Argan Oil.  I use it for my face, hands, feet.  It does not leave your skin with a greasy feeling but soaks in and leaves your skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry cuticles and the same for my feet and this has helped tremendously.  It feels great on my face and I can tell a difference if I fail to use the product.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and skin. I have noticed a difference in both. My hair breaks less and is more shiny. I apply to my skin about once a week. My skin feels softer and I use lotion less than I used to. It&#x27;s like my skin is heather.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of the smell but it fades fast and does not linger after the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Having paid a lot more for a similar product that actually gave me less as well I have to say I am pleased. The first thing you will notice with this product is that this isn&#x27;t some watered down, stepped on version of Argan oil. This is the real stuff which also means you can use a lot less of it and get the same results you&#x27;ve more then likely been spending a lot more for (i.e. I know I was). It never hurts to go organic either!</li>
            <li> I have tried several hair smoothing serums in the past and just haven&#x27;t seen the kind of results I&#x27;ve wanted. Just Argan Oil truly has made a difference the texture and manageability of my hair. It is much softer, looks smooth and shiny and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I also love using the product as a &amp;#34;booster&amp;#34; in my everyday hand and body lotion. Just a couple of drops really hydrates my skin and leaves it softer for hours longer than just lotion alone.&lt;br /&gt;My FAVORITE perk of Just Aragan Oil is seeing the incredible results with my young son&#x27;s eczema. His hands were dry and cracking and nothing seemed to help. I started adding a few drops of the oil to his medicated ointment and within just a few days, his hands were no longer red and tender and the cracking and peeling is GONE! It is remarkable. I will be a long time user of Just Aragan Oil, most certainly!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I ise it on my face, neck and hair. It leaves my face and neck soft and smooth with no greasy aftermath. It absorbs very nicely. It calms my frizzy hair and leaves a nice shine with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I have used Argon Oil for awhile but wanted to try this also.  I love it.  I use it on my face every day and hands and arms.  Skin is so soft, never oily.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great price!!</li>
            <li> I had tried the more expensive brand of Argan Oil and really loved it, but the cost was a bit expensive. So, I looked for one that offered the same process and benefits. Nature&#x27;s oil offers more for the dollar and has worked well thus far. The texture is a bit heavier, so you use may use less. The benefits have been wonderful, it absorbs quickly and my skin looks smooth and feels soft. I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because i really like how it works and feels on my skin and hair. It works well for an all around moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly, but DRY hair...this oil really helps! There are very few things that help with my hair, and I have tried alot!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moJ9TOFJ63ABT3]]My friend Amy and I run a youtube channel together. Amy had been looking for something to help with her son&#x27;s eczema for a while because nothing she had tried previously had helped much. She was approached by Nature&#x27;s Life Oils to try Just Argan Oil and see if it would be helpful. She was very skeptical at first, but then was very excited after she saw the results of using Just Argan Oil. So, we had to create a video about it. Hope you enjoy it and I hope Just Argan Oil is as beneficial for you as it has been for Amy and me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed, but there are a lot of different Argan Oil products listed on Amazon. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this one because I thought it was one I had already tried before, but then realized it was different.  After trying this one I&#x27;m glad to say I&#x27;ve found the one I&#x27;ll be sticking with.  There are a few reasons I like this one better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It&#x27;s a cool design and I like the goat.  Funny reason, but it&#x27;s true.  The truth is, a lot of the other Argan Oils being sold on Amazon are basically the same, so I might as well go with the one that looks the best.  I was curious about the goat, and found out that goats like to eat argan fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - It&#x27;s one of the few argan oils that are triple extra virgin. It might just be marketing hype, but just in case, I wanted to get the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - The company has great customer service.  A girl with the company called me about a week after I got it to make sure I was happy with my order and to answer any questions I had.  I didn&#x27;t have any questions, but I thought it was a great personal touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in homemade conditioners, and so far so good!  It is my first attempt so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it against, but this product seemed to have the best price for the quality.  I&#x27;m pleased and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this on my split ends and stretchmarks and they have been going away. My ends dont go crazy when i style my hair and I think i will be able to show flawless thighs for the rest of summer</li>
            <li> This is the first oil I&#x27;ve used that has actually restored my broken, straw-like hair ends. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this after hearing about how amazing Argan Oil is. It has so many uses and is one of natures little miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter saw the bottle of Organic Argan Oil I bought from Nature’s Life Oils on my desk and said “Dad, can I use this on my hair?” and I let her use a little bit just to see what would happen and she came back in super excited about how it removed all of her frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed a little bit and told her “Yes but it also keeps your hair healthy and strong” but being a teen she only cared about how cute it made her hair look. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has had an eczema rash on her arm for a long time and nothing she has tried even remotely helped the rash or making her feel better about herself. She’s been embarrassed about it and she ended up using this Triple Extra Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil on the skin that was affected by the eczema without me knowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I noticed that her arm looked a lot better. She finally told me that she had tried the oil on her skin and I told her that I think it’s actually taking the rash away and encouraged her to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days you can hardly tell that there was even a rash there. I am simply amazed with the results of using this Moroccan Oil. I had no idea how powerful this stuff really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many natural uses for this oil and seeing first hand the amazing effects of using this product I highly recommend Just Argon Oil by Natures Life Oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife as she wanted to try some argan oil products. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. She has seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of her hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair. A little bit, goes a long way. She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now and have very much enjoyed the experience thus far.  I didn&#x27;t expect to have fallen in love with the product.  I have recently gone from a brunette to a blonde and my hair has gone through a few chemical treatments.  I was incredibly surprised at my results after only 1 treatment.  My hair was soft and less frizzy.  After 2 months, my hair is shiny and strong.  I do believe it is because of the use of this product.  My skin is supple as well.  I use it on my face and body.  I also use it on my kids and their hair.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been so happy with my Argon Oil purchase. I have frizzy hair with a ton of fly-aways. I&#x27;ve been using the oil to help smooth everything out and it&#x27;s worked great! It makes my hair feel so soft without leaving any oil appearance. I&#x27;ve also used the oil on my baby. She has pretty dry skin and a couple drops of the oil has helped restore her soft baby skin. We love this product!</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands. It penetrates the skin very fast. No oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of my hair. I have been very pleased with the results in my skin as well as my skin of my young son, who suffers from eczema. I have seen dramatic improvements as I&#x27;ve combined his medicated lotion, with the argan oil- it absorbs into the skin much more effectively than when we have just used the lotion alone. Since using the oil, his hands have healed and they are no longer cracked and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended this oil to anyone who wants softer, healthier looking hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I have loved my Just Argan Oil since the very beginning when I first purchased it! It has cleared up my cracked heels on my feet. It&#x27;s wonderful on the cuticles of my nails. Just a few drops shines my hair! I&#x27;m loving it on my face for my wrinkles and as a moisturizer before I put on my makeup. It&#x27;s also helping my husband&#x27;s dry itchy rash on his leg. I definitely will be making another purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife is very big into organic and natural products and supplements.  However we will use medical products when we feel a little more potent a remedy is needed (accepting whatever side effects medications may have).  I tend to have very dry skin (especially working in the field as I do with concrete and other construction materials).  While it may sound unmanly to say such a thing, I don&#x27;t like having my hands literally cracked and bleeding all the time.  I&#x27;ve used a number of medicated products that help to a degree but they seem to cause me to have rashes and some skin discoloration.  I&#x27;ve also tried a few oils, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help without applying it all the time.  This Just Argan Oil has really helped.  It helps as much if not more than the medicated stuff and it doesn&#x27;t have any strange effects on my skin.  My wife says it&#x27;s great with her hair, which is great too, but it really does well with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the buy! Use it for my hair and my feet and works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for the good reviews and do not regret it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a ton of products for our son&#x27;s eczema. Some worked okay, and others not so much. Mixing argan oil with his creams we&#x27;ve used in the past, and his skin has cleared up a ton. It&#x27;s been great!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Just Argan oil for a little while and have been happier with this oil than the one in the blue bottle. I will never buy it at the salon again for the exorbitant price they charge.It&#x27;s also been very good as a carrier oil for  aromatherapy and it helps my hair,nails and skin at the same time!  Bebe H. Birmingham, Michigan</li>
            <li> Just recently I purchased Argan Oil. I began using it on my hair to give it a shiny appearance. It works great for this! Then I began using it on my legs for dry skin. So far, I prefer this type of oil over other oils I&#x27;ve used. Unlike other oils I&#x27;ve used for dry skin, Argan Oil actually soaks into my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results from using this oil over the next month.</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil with my lotion. I put it on first then put lotion over the top. My skin stays more moisturized when I do this. I also tried the argan oil in my hair, it made is so silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I dont like is the smell. but I am willing to put up with the smell to have a 100% organic product without fake perfumes</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my curly hair before my other hair products, and it has worked really well at keeping the frizz down without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy.  And it only takes a few drops on my shoulder length, medium thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this oil before my hand cream, especially around my cuticles, where they get irritated and dry from washing my hands a lot at work, and have seen a definite improvement in how long they stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received some other tips about using this argan oil from the seller, which I will be trying out next.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Argan oil to my family and friends so they can use this wonderful oil and be able to have the same experience as me. I use it for my hair,my face and any dry areas on me. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Leaves nails and skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the oil; not to heavy and soaks into your skin nicely.  The price is right too; will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Janice</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand of Moroccan oil. I find new uses for it every day. Thank you!</li>
