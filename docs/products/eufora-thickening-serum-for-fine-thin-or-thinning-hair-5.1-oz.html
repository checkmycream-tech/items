            <li> As desperate as I am to reclaim some vestige of the thick, curly hair I&#x27;ve always had, I will probably buy one more bottle, but if there are still no results I will revert back to what I was doing before: Praying for follicle mercy from the hair gods (Oprah and Elvis).</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair at all.</li>
            <li> My previous stylist  got me hooked on this serum.</li>
            <li> One small pump of this shampoo is all you need, it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> For anyone with thinning or thin hair it instantly gives you thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Two small pumps applied to my medium length hair and I feel like my hair has doubled in volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very thin hair and now add male pattern baldness.</li>

            <li> tried so many products to help regrowth from bad relaxers, breakage from tight braids and extentions. And, the Eufora product line is the best and with very quick regrowth.  Very costly, but with the results &amp;#34;Cost doesn&#x27;t Matter! The secret is do not mix there wonderful products with others, and you will be HAPPY with the results.  This has been a total BLESSING for me, now I can come out of the wigs-HALLELUAH!!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems that when I find something I like at my salon, they no longer carry it.  So happy that through Amazon I am able to keep purchasing this.  I have very fine hair and this shampoo makes a great difference!</li>
            <li> buy with Scalp treatment by Eufora</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice anything great when using this.  Using it anyway to use up the product but will not be repurchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses Eufora products knows how wonderful they are.  I have baby fine, greying hair that is color treated and highlighted - not the best combination of conditions.  It is so easy to damage baby fine hair.  Eufora has saved my hair.  I could go on about their shampoo, conditioner etc, but this review is about their Thickening Serum - a relatively new product that I was fortunate to get early on (my beautician is a trainer for Eufora).  It&#x27;s rare that I don&#x27;t have at least one reservation about a product, but this is it.  I love this serum.  Two small pumps applied to my medium length hair and I feel like my hair has doubled in volume.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty or sticky, just thicker.  Additionally, my hair seems to keep it&#x27;s style better, with less effort on my part.  I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve tried so many so-called volumizers that I had given up hope.  This one exceeds all my expectations - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very thin hair and now add male pattern baldness. This stuff holds my hair in place even on a windy day. It&#x27;s well worth the money. I don&#x27;t notice the stickiness that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Works great for staying hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to hormonal fluctuations caused by early perimenopause. (Whee!) My stylist gave me a hard sell on this product, promising that it would make my hair grow. I was skeptical. &amp;#34;My doc said decreasing hormones are causing my hair fall. How can this product halt/reverse that?&amp;#34; She said, &amp;#34;This will work with your hormones!&amp;#34; As that really was no answer I was still skeptical but she was so adamant that the product would help me that I bought it. I have now used one entire bottle, applying it to both wet and dry head, twice a day. There is no new hair growth, but I understand that the product does NOT claim to stimulate hair growth, so I don&#x27;t fault the product for that. It does however claim to thicken hair but neither have I noticed any thickening. As desperate as I am to reclaim some vestige of the thick, curly hair I&#x27;ve always had, I will probably buy one more bottle, but if there are still no results I will revert back to what I was doing before: Praying for follicle mercy from the hair gods (Oprah and Elvis).</li>
            <li> I have the full set of Eufora Thickening hair care.  This serum is fabulous!  Actually, all of it is.  All you do is pump some on your hand, spread it on your damp hair and blow dry.  It makes your hair so much fuller than it is normally.  It also seems to me that my hair holds the style longer.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this product works great to make your hair feel fuller/thicker.</li>
            <li> This product is brilliant, you need just a very tiny amount to give your hair extra body.  I use with other Eufora products and love the results.  I&#x27;ve very, fine, thin, limp hair.  This product helps me feel so much better about my hair!  Live it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but there are other good options that don&#x27;t cost asuch</li>
            <li> Anything EUFORA is the best thing anyone can do for their hair!!!!!! Im addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Very Thin and Fine hair and this product works the best out of anything! It is in my budget :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to the Eufora brand years ago, and I have been a fan ever since. The thickening line is relatively new, but it works wonders. One small pump of this shampoo is all you need, it lathers extremely well. I had one bottle last me over six months. The smell is a very clean, mint smell and the shampoo does add serious volume to my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This has worked miracles for me (fine hair) and for my sister, who had a drug-related problem with thinning hair. It actually promoted growth. Use it regularly now!</li>
            <li> I tried this product out and really did not give my hair the feeling of thickening the strands, instead it made my hair feel \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;.  I will try the product a few more times, but not sure if I am 100% happy with it.</li>
            <li> My previous stylist  got me hooked on this serum. For anyone with thinning or thin hair it instantly gives you thicker hair. i blow dry my hair which is fine and thin and this product works wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair at all.</li>
