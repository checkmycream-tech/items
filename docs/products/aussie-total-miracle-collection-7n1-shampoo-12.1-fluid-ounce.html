            <li>One of the best shampoo products.  </li>
            <li>Excelent product; THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li>Decided to try this because it was rated as the best value shampoos by one of the magazines.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>My sister loved!!!</li>
            <li>She said thai it was the best Christmas presente.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>but I just add some moisturizing conditioner to it and it cleanses great.</li>
            <li>I think its great</li>
            <li>This is great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>the service was great...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner is the best.</li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>What can I say more about it!</li>
            <li>and I was extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>and while I loved the TGIF line I love Aussie</li>
            <li>Everything was great - the product arrived on great condition and the shampoo works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used products that do this more effectively for equivalent price.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product, leaves hair super silky and soft, besides the smell is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Incredible product, fast seller and quick deliver!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it does wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>a smidgen better and for the cost</li>
            <li>I used to love this years ago.  </li>
            <li>So, I added the shampoo into my beauty regimen and I love how these products make my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I only use this shampoo on my Indian hair weaves and Brazilian hair weaves, and it&#x27;s awesome for that!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great also and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my hair was soooo soft and I was able to run my fingers right through my hair which I must mention both the conditioners and shampoo have excellent slip!</li>
            <li>Sure it was cheap, but Suave products are cheaper and work better than this.</li>
            <li>this product smells great, I use the conditioner with it which is amazing too... doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy...</li>
            <li>super strong smell.  </li>
            <li>leaves my scalp so clean and the scent is out of this</li>
            <li>It leaves hair clean without making it feel crispy.</li>
            <li>Aussie Moist was average at best, and I&#x27;ve really just been trying to get through the bottle.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>But my hair stay soft and i love</li>
            <li>Its on sale right now at cvs for 2.99.</li>
            <li>Here in brazil this shampoo is very expwnsive if we compare the price!</li>
            <li>used the whole line (conditioner, shampoo &amp; 3 minute miracle) starting with the conditioner as my prepoo followed by the shampoo to cleanse followed by the 3 minute miracle to deep condition and my hair has never felt better!!</li>
            <li>Aussie Moist is my new hair friend!!</li>
            <li>This really helps me keep soft hair that isn&#x27;t overly greasy</li>
            <li>Since I rotate it with my other shampoos, it is fine.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and no other problem .</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always so soft!</li>
            <li>Well not with this line, my hair remained soft while drying</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it more than 2 days in a row or else I get a few pimples on the side of my face, neck or upper shoulders.</li>
            <li>Awesome cheap stuff for the maintenance of very expensive fake hair.</li>
            <li>I found that it did leave my hair with some moisture and did not dry it out like a lot of the grocery store brands.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m currently about 3/4 through the bottles, and now my hair is getting oily less than a day after shampooing and conditioning with this!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse curly dry hair</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard to open with wet hands, but that is not a reflection of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to dry out.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying to my hair</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair super dry and rough, and it smells horrible, never ever had anything this bad.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically relaxed but very thick and past my shoulders.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the BOMB.COM!!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my scalp so clean and the scent is out of this world!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles of this as well as two conditioners from cvs for 2 for $6 each, you can&#x27;t beat that!!! I love it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it more than 2 days in a row or else I get a few pimples on the side of my face, neck or upper shoulders. Since I rotate it with my other shampoos, it is fine.The bottle is hard to open with wet hands, but that is not a reflection of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoo products.  Delivery on time.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered the aussie line and am so happy that I did and mad that I&#x27;ve missing out all this time on it! I actually tested this line out along wtih TGIF and while I loved the TGIF line I love Aussie a smidgen better and for the cost will definiltey be making this my staple line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole line (conditioner, shampoo &amp; 3 minute miracle) starting with the conditioner as my prepoo followed by the shampoo to cleanse followed by the 3 minute miracle to deep condition and my hair has never felt better!! Even as I washed out the shampoo my hair was soooo soft and I was able to run my fingers right through my hair which I must mention both the conditioners and shampoo have excellent slip! The deciding point for me was when I rinsed out and left my hair to dry because sometimes products work well while washing but as soon as I rinse out and dry so does my hair until I put something else on it. Well not with this line, my hair remained soft while drying and I was extremely pleased! Aussie Moist is my new hair friend!!</li>
            <li> super strong smell.  I used to love this years ago.  Either the product changed or I grew up.</li>
            <li> I have always bought salon hair products and found a review about Aussie&#x27;s three minute moist conditioner. It works better than anything else I have used in the past. So, I added the shampoo into my beauty regimen and I love how these products make my hair feel. It&#x27;s always so soft! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo often because of its drying properties. My hair is chemically relaxed but very thick and past my shoulders. A friend gave me this shampoo because it didn&#x27;t work for her so I gave it a try. I found that it did leave my hair with some moisture and did not dry it out like a lot of the grocery store brands.  I will use this again although sparingly. I do think that it would work on those needing moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It can be a little drying to my hair but I just add some moisturizing conditioner to it and it cleanses great.</li>
            <li> Excelent product; THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this because it was rated as the best value shampoos by one of the magazines. Sure it was cheap, but Suave products are cheaper and work better than this. Aussie Moist was average at best, and I&#x27;ve really just been trying to get through the bottle. I purchased this and the matching conditioner from drugstore.com. I&#x27;m currently about 3/4 through the bottles, and now my hair is getting oily less than a day after shampooing and conditioning with this! This has never happened, and I&#x27;ve actually always thought my hair was on the dryer side. It completely weighs my hair down even though I put the conditioner only at the ends. Definitely won&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife and she swears by the quality of this item. She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> this product smells great, I use the conditioner with it which is amazing too... doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy... I think its great</li>
            <li> Everything was great - the product arrived on great condition and the shampoo works very well.  Bottle is smaller than what you can buy at Target, but that&#x27;s what I wanted - something smaller and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> Kept my ultra-long, wavy hair in order. Good, and I&#x27;ve used products that do this more effectively for equivalent price.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have tried. It leaves hair clean without making it feel crispy. The conditioner is great also and I highly recommend it. It got rid of all my tangles. I have fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner is the best. Its on sale right now at cvs for 2.99.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before..This is great shampoo.  I would recommend anyone buying this product from Amazon the service was great...</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever! Here in brazil this shampoo is very expwnsive if we compare the price! But my hair stay soft and i love</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair slightly dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse curly dry hair so I only use this shampoo on my Indian hair weaves and Brazilian hair weaves, and it&#x27;s awesome for that! Cleansing and not drying, and then paired with the conditioner it makes the hair spring back to life. Awesome cheap stuff for the maintenance of very expensive fake hair.</li>
            <li> My sister loved!!! She said thai it was the best Christmas presente.</li>
