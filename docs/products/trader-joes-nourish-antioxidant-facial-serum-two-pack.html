    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This serum, though, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I find that a lot of products with sunscreen aren&#x27;t a very good primer for make-up as they go on chalky, so I mix the two before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I always try to moisturize before putting makeup on, but a lot of creams aren&#x27;t very good for that.</li>
            <li>Very good for the face.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy with wonderful benefits.</li>
            <li>Leaves a beautiful glow too</li>
            <li>Bunch of Chazari was also a great company to buy from.</li>
            <li>Great product - will order again...</li>
            <li>It is great to use for a night time moisturizer or under makeup.  </li>
            <li>First, it smells beyond wonderful but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love this product and the fact that it came in a day before it said it would!</li>
            <li>This serum is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am on my way to feeling great about going makeup free, if I choose to.</li>
            <li>So good I ordered more</li>
            <li>Like applying silky plastic gel to your skin with a nice fragrance...</li>
            <li>I think I might still need a very (very) light moisturizer on top of the serum</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful facial serum!</li>
            <li>i LOVE the way this serum feels.</li>
            <li>I love Trader Joe&#x27;s products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>I have noticed great improvement in my skin tone so much so that I went to Trader Joe&#x27;s and purchased the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>I used and enjoyed this product when it was available at Trader Joe&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This feels great on your skin and has such a nice, light scent (and I&#x27;m not a person who likes scents).</li>
            <li>Good buy and super fast ship!  A+++</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It may be great for a different skin type.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The results of fine lines and smoothing your skin are much better than any of those high dollar department store serums.  </li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of it and my makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>They were fast with correspondence through email and very friendly.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to learn that it is now available throuh Amazon and a little more reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight burning sensation when I first apply it, which is good in my opinion.. makes me think the retinol is doing its job.  </li>
            <li>Second time ordering this , fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It also works really well as a makeup primer, it keeps skin from getting oily throughout the day!</li>
            <li>I would really recommend!</li>
            <li>Once they would aware of the problem they corrected it.  </li>
            <li>(more dry in the winter).</li>
            <li>silky but not oily and really softens the skin.</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, it has a very silky consistency once you apply to your skin.</li>
            <li>This serum is light enough to not!</li>
            <li>Like everyone else has said, if you have a TJs near you, buy it there because it is only $9.99! :)</li>
            <li>It is extra hydrating and leaves face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>And I feel like the ingredients are less toxic than most makeup products.</li>
            <li>This product really makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recall the exact delivery day, only that it was timely.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Product leaves skin feeling silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have used Principle Secret which I believe really does work but considering the cost this is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>but I did have trouble receiving my full order from this company.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t necessarily treat the acne that I have, but it does not CAUSE any breakouts at all like other serums and moisturizers, it makes my skin feel incredibly soft and healthy and silky, and I have seen a decrease in the amount of dark marks from where I have picked at acne (probably from the Vitamin E oil and other antioxidants).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> add a little touch of it to my AM makeup and it makes skin feel like velvet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am watching it improve everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than the serums I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> and it takes very little product to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I had used the product in the past</li>
            <li> less expensive at trader joes tho.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and brake out terribly except with this.</li>

            <li> Absolutely wonderful facial serum! It always leaves my skin feeling so soft. Bunch of Chazari was also a great company to buy from. They were fast with correspondence through email and very friendly. I will definitely be buying from them in the future.</li>
            <li> Good buy and super fast ship!  A+++</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have been using this product for around six months now.  I initially bought it as a serum to put on at night, but now I use with my daytime moisturizer.  I find that a lot of products with sunscreen aren&#x27;t a very good primer for make-up as they go on chalky, so I mix the two before applying makeup.  I love the silky feel of it and my makeup goes on much smoother.  This is a great buy with wonderful benefits.</li>
            <li> Feels oily after application and did not work well for my acne- prone skin. It may be great for a different skin type.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and brake out terribly except with this. It is extra hydrating and leaves face feeling clean and refreshed. Leaves a beautiful glow too</li>
            <li> This stuff is so ooooo good.&lt;br /&gt;I add a little touch of it to my AM makeup and it makes skin feel like velvet.&lt;br /&gt;You gotta try it even for just your A M Makeup</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this , fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> i LOVE the way this serum feels. silky but not oily and really softens the skin. less expensive at trader joes tho.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.  First, it smells beyond wonderful but isn&#x27;t overpowering. I can actually feel it tightening my skin, especially around my eyes and I can definitely see a difference after only one day.  It has a slight burning sensation when I first apply it, which is good in my opinion.. makes me think the retinol is doing its job.  It&#x27;s a little thicker than the serums I&#x27;ve used in the past and it takes very little product to cover my face and neck.  I think I might still need a very (very) light moisturizer on top of the serum but that&#x27;s fine.  I love Trader Joe&#x27;s products and this is no exception.  And I love that it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> So basically, I like to use this as a makeup primer. I always try to moisturize before putting makeup on, but a lot of creams aren&#x27;t very good for that. This serum, though, works perfectly. And I feel like the ingredients are less toxic than most makeup products. Oh, and it&#x27;s cheap. So yeah. It&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> I had used the product in the past so knew what I was buying.  Don&#x27;t recall the exact delivery day, only that it was timely.  (I do recommend the product)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now, and I LOVE it! I am 23, and have been dealing with moderate acne around my chin, neck and cheeks for a few years now. I have combination skin that gets oily in the T-zone and regular to dry everywhere else (more dry in the winter). This doesn&#x27;t necessarily treat the acne that I have, but it does not CAUSE any breakouts at all like other serums and moisturizers, it makes my skin feel incredibly soft and healthy and silky, and I have seen a decrease in the amount of dark marks from where I have picked at acne (probably from the Vitamin E oil and other antioxidants). It can wear this alone in the summer, but it doesn&#x27;t give me enough moisture in winter, so I wear it under my moisturizer when my skin in really dry (I use a brand name moisturizer now but I have used the TJs version and it works well also!). It also works really well as a makeup primer, it keeps skin from getting oily throughout the day! I would really recommend! Like everyone else has said, if you have a TJs near you, buy it there because it is only $9.99! :)</li>
            <li> Love the product but I did have trouble receiving my full order from this company.  Once they would aware of the problem they corrected it.  This product really makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great product - will order again...probably today!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have noticed great improvement in my skin tone so much so that I went to Trader Joe&#x27;s and purchased the moisturizer. The serum doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, it has a very silky consistency once you apply to your skin. I have breakouts that I experience sometimes, on one side of my face, on my cheek and I am watching it improve everyday. I am on my way to feeling great about going makeup free, if I choose to. This is well worth the money. I have used Principle Secret which I believe really does work but considering the cost this is worthwhile. This is it for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the fact that it came in a day before it said it would!</li>
            <li> This feels great on your skin and has such a nice, light scent (and I&#x27;m not a person who likes scents).</li>
            <li> Very good for the face. Like the way my face feels after using it</li>
            <li> Came fast;great product.</li>
            <li> Product leaves skin feeling silky and soft.  It is great to use for a night time moisturizer or under makeup.  The results of fine lines and smoothing your skin are much better than any of those high dollar department store serums.  I will always keep this product on hand, and use it twice a day.  This serum is light enough to not! block pores.  Thank you for offering this serum for those of us not fortunate enough to have a Trader Joes.</li>
            <li> So good I ordered more</li>
            <li> Like applying silky plastic gel to your skin with a nice fragrance... I checked the ingredients... Vinyl cross polymer?!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Trader Joe&#x27;s.  I like it so far.  I use it with moisturizer. Skin feels so solt.  To soon to tell if it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used and enjoyed this product when it was available at Trader Joe&#x27;s.  For some unexplainable reason the owners decided to discontinue selling this product.  I was pleased to learn that it is now available throuh Amazon and a little more reasonable in price.  I like what it does for the skin on my face and neck.</li>
