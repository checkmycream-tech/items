            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone who has trouble doing a cat eye. This brush makes it so much easier. The brush was a little smaller than expected, but its not a big issue.</li>
            <li> this is a good brush I use sometimes to apply eye liner. I think I would like it a little more if the bristles were a little shorter or stiffer because I would have little more control. I think it is a matter of preference though, I think depending on what you are looking for you might like this brush more than me.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush, sold at a great price. I use it specifically to apply latisse and it is great. It is good for any precise applications around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It shipped quick and it works great.  I am very happy with the quality of this brush and recommend it to anyone looking to buy it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do what it is for .. so thick.. the Bristles hard to clean ..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use for applying Lattisse to my upper eyelashes. It delivers a perfect amount of the liquid. Also great for lining lashes. Thin quality material...just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This featherweight, lightweight and easy to use and does not need to be washed in fatigue and thank you for the production company and for all thanks</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday. Very easy to take care of and keeps it&#x27;s shape. I love it. Great price!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find a product that I could use to perfect my eyeliner but this brush fell short. The hairs are uneven and come out easily and are rough on my eyelids when I try to use it. The price was not worth spending the money for this product. I have no idea where this brush even is at the moment, when i like my products I keep a close eye on them. So clearly I didn&#x27;t care to loose this.</li>
            <li> I love this brush ..  I wish I had purchased more than one.[[ASIN:B004L1AC70 Bent Eyeliner Antibacterial Makeup Brush #708 - Travel Line]]</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for gel eye liner. It is great for a tight fine line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and slim bent eye liner brush, good if you like to put or style your gel eyeliner in precise way (like cat eyes etc) I like to go bold so for me better use the flat thicker eye liner brush..</li>
            <li> just the right stiffness and softness plus easy to clean.  The brush hairs do not fall out either which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sparingly applying Careprost! I bought one for my best friend as well. This will help make the product last. Don&#x27;t need to over apply.</li>
            <li> Use this brush with Fran Wilson cake eyeliner and it is the best makeup brush I have. Perfect, perfect for applying eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Very fine tip. Can be used to make super thin lines. However, the handle is VERY short. I like to store my brushes in a mug to air dry, but it barely reaches the top and gets lost.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Really love the style of this brush, makes application easy and doesn&#x27;t clog up like other brushes.  Very good choice</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price. As a novice I am able to  use this brush with ease an accuracy.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with these brushes.  I purchased the bent liner brush and the 776 which is a blending/contour brush, similar to a MAC 217.  The bent brush has a really nice pointed tip.  I would recommend these brushes to anyone wanting a quality brush but not wanting to pay $20-30 per brush.  I am starting a makeup business and will purchase more of these to supplement my kit.</li>
            <li> The quality AND  design of this brush is excellent. I wasnt sure I was going to like the bent design but it is my favorite brush to use to apply bare minerals powered shawdows. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding an eyeliner brush that was tiny enough to suit me.  This one is perfect--very thin!</li>
