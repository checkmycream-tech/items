    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for a week and it makes a wonderful difference to the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not the best shampoo for my frizzy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>GREAT SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>and this is a great product for me.</li>
            <li>This was great product.</li>
            <li>It also has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li>Mizani Oil Shampoo, Supreme, 8.5 Ounce another good product by Mizani.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise...  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Not yet sure if I will stick with this product yet.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of hair products.  </li>
            <li>Mizani normally makes great products, so I&#x27;m unsure if the problem is the shampoo, or perhaps the seller.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is creamy and felt really smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>keeps hair smooth not greasy</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo...doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and leaves it soft and tangle free!  </li>
            <li>finally a great  shampoo for natural or relaxed hair that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and leaves my hair clean and soft and doesn&#x27;t strip away moisture.</li>
            <li>Mizani makes great products, but this buyer has managed to taint it/replace it with some other no-count product and repackage it.  </li>
            <li>I can always tell if a shampoo is good, because my hair will not be rough when I rinse the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But it is one that is near the top of my list.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very silky and rich.  </li>
            <li>This product provided the right amount of moisture needed to prevent breakage and split ends.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and does not leave my hair as dry as some other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I thought you were supposed to wash first, then condition.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mizani!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever used a Mizani product I did not like.</li>
            <li>What I will say is that when I washed my daughters hair, I mixed the shampoo with condition and hers came out fine.  </li>
            <li>I have dry hair and this product makes it feel so smooth, shiny and hidrated.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I thought that this is one of the better shampoos that I have used on my African American natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this product during the first 4 months of my transition from permed back to natural hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the entire product line</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and manageable after use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other reason for it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you will have a hot mess of tangled hair on your hands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for those who blow dry and flat iron hair a lot.</li>

            <li> This shampoo left my hair completely and utterly tangled, which has never , ever happened when using a Mizani ( or few other for that matter) product.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this long ago...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought it would be a cheaper alternative to Wen.  Too drying.  I have relaxed coarse hair.  This did not strip my color but it was too drying.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOO. DOES NOT LEAVE HAIR FEELING GREASY.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  Leaves hair silky.</li>
            <li> like silkiness feel of hair</li>
            <li> I used this product during the first 4 months of my transition from permed back to natural hair. As anyone who is transitioning understands, the hair can loose its shine and moisture. This product provided the right amount of moisture needed to prevent breakage and split ends.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and very manageable. It also has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week and it makes a wonderful difference to the texture of my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Mizani Oil Shampoo, Supreme, 8.5 Ounce another good product by Mizani. The smell is pleasant and it is sulfate free. The shampoo is creamy and felt really smooth to the touch. This shampoo is not drying like others on the market.</li>
            <li> Not the best shampoo for my frizzy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> keeps hair smooth not greasy</li>
            <li> This product was an utter disappointment to say the least!!!!!  My hair was so tangled after I washed and used the conditioner.  I can always tell if a shampoo is good, because my hair will not be rough when I rinse the shampoo.  It took me about 30 minutes to untangle my hair.  The non-professional products don&#x27;t even do my hair like this.  This must definitely be a knock-off product.  No question about it....  There&#x27;s no other reason for it.  Mizani makes great products, but this buyer has managed to taint it/replace it with some other no-count product and repackage it.  Conveniently (for the buyer), the buyer does not authorize returns for this product, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  What I will say is that when I washed my daughters hair, I mixed the shampoo with condition and hers came out fine.  But, wait... I thought you were supposed to wash first, then condition.  Word to the wise...  If you plan to buy this product regardless of what I&#x27;ve mentioned, mix the shampoo and conditioner together... Otherwise, you will have a hot mess of tangled hair on your hands.  #I got hustled!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have dry hair and this product makes it feel so smooth, shiny and hidrated. I&#x27;m not using anything else from now on!</li>
            <li> Mizani normally makes great products, so I&#x27;m unsure if the problem is the shampoo, or perhaps the seller. This shampoo left my hair completely and utterly tangled, which has never , ever happened when using a Mizani ( or few other for that matter) product. Now I know to only purchase in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo...doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and leaves it soft and tangle free!  Wish I had this long ago...Thanks Mizani!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but i wonder why the company does not make larger sizes. I wish they did.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and this is a great product for me. I really like the entire product line</li>
            <li> watery but i guess thats the way it is</li>
            <li> This was great product. My hair was soft and manageable after use. I highly recommend this for those who blow dry and flat iron hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought that this is one of the better shampoos that I have used on my African American natural hair.

But it is one that is near the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I had to give this product away! I had a bad reaction to it. It made my scalp itch like crazy!  I was not sure if it was this or the Supreme Oil Mask, so I used them separately yo see ehich product it was. OMG ! Both products tore my scalp up.  This is the first time I ever used a Mizani product I did not like.</li>
            <li> finally a great  shampoo for natural or relaxed hair that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and leaves my hair clean and soft and doesn&#x27;t strip away moisture.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of hair products.  The shampoo is very silky and rich.  It leaves my hair moisturized in a way that other shampoos don&#x27;t.</li>
