            <li>Still, I think this Airfloss is best reserved for those people who will not EVER floss, and therefore they may get some benefit from using this.</li>

            <li>Im happy with it!</li>
            <li>Since it is pulsing all the time, you do not need it perfectly aligned with the gap between your teeth; just move it along your teeth at the gum line.  </li>

            <li>Philips was great and replaced both units.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about a month</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s a great idea</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Great buy....</li>
            <li>have gotten great gum health reports from my dentist since using it, so even though the engineering is imperfect, I will continue to use it faithfully.</li>
            <li>Have had great dental checkups since started using this 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great water pick.</li>
            <li>We have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for about 20 years and this is a great addition to their product line.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>It was working great</li>
            <li>Great designs</li>
            <li>great while it worked</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>We are happy</li>
            <li>A great match to our snooker tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>and it is very effective.</li>
            <li>Item is working very nice</li>
            <li>It is a very nice Dental Health Product from Philips</li>
            <li>Very good, It works really well, very happy with the product, I had very good results with it</li>
            <li>Quality of Philips&#x27; products can&#x27;t be beat, and I can honestly say the flosser is incredible.</li>
            <li>Flossing is so important to keep you teeth and gums in great shape and having the Sonicare Airflosser is perfect because it gets the job done and it feels great doing the job.</li>
            <li>Wonderful but could be better if it had 2 speeds.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may not be perfect in my dental hygienist&#x27;s eyes, but it&#x27;s a LOT better than not doing anything.  </li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>I love that I can put my own mouthwash in it!!</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect, and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Excellent product, easy to use and does a good job.</li>
            <li>However, Phillips has wonderful customer support and they immediately sent me a replacement which works fine.</li>
            <li>I think Philips is able to design very good products.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from the kind of terminal laziness that most of us non-flossers have, and this product has been a wonderful solution.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and performance is amazing.</li>
            <li>Once the plastic doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s airtight position, it no longer succeeds in flossing with water.</li>
            <li>(I have mostly good gums</li>
            <li>, I loved that I could use mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>Good battery one week.</li>
            <li>Maybe my dentist office is just THAT good.</li>
            <li>It blasts a good bit of mouthwash or water into your mouth.</li>
            <li>He must have gotten the one good one.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I used it with mouthwash and the single-burst function so that I could control the pace of the bursts, and had a good experience with it.</li>
            <li>If the work they are doing a good job.</li>
            <li>it do a good at flossing?&lt;br /&gt;Yes.</li>
            <li>Is quite good.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a good idea</li>
            <li>Wonderful fit, for what I require in a product</li>
            <li>think the Airflosser would be good for someone transitioning into flossing.</li>
            <li>It is fairly shallow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist says this is as good as using floss string.</li>
            <li>so this will be a good test.  </li>
            <li>Good product just not convinced how well it cleans</li>
            <li>good idea, but</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>For me an easier way to floss, &amp; does a good job.</li>
            <li>However, I did not feel it was a fair test of whether it will substitute for flossing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those things we know are good for you but what a chore it can be.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust this as a good alternative to flossing, but it has its place.</li>
            <li>It is good for those times you want to floss with mouth wash or just air puffs.</li>
            <li>I never remember and am not too good at it</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good idea if you have weaker teeth, maybe ask your dentist before you get it.</li>
            <li>You can feel it doing good.</li>
            <li>As with others, the IDEA might be good, but the way this works is ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a good product until it</li>
            <li>It works really good once you get that.</li>
            <li>You get a good feeling after using this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after my sister n law told me how good it works.  </li>
            <li>Airfloss does take out quite a fair bit of gunk and doesn&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li>awesome product which gives me floss free.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it......</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, Philips replaced my unit twice although the warranty is just one year.</li>
            <li>good product&lt;</li>
            <li>My wife loved this product.  </li>
            <li>I had a identical Phillips Sonicare HX8211/02 from my dentist and loved it</li>
            <li>Good power and portable</li>
            <li>However, if you never floss, that doesn&#x27;t do any good.</li>
            <li>Good buy (although $10 more than buying at amazon), good cleaning tool for me and my husband!</li>
            <li>If I were dealing with braces on the front of my teeth, I have no doubt this could be an excellent way to clean the wires and</li>
            <li>could be an excellent way to clean the wires and</li>
            <li>Best tool to clean teeth with or without braces.</li>
            <li>If you have ideal spacing between teeth, the I think I could see this being more effective.</li>
            <li>Very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>great product and price , I love it</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t very many reviews on the site but they ALL give the product one star.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Phillip Sonicare electric flosser.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Works great does the job easier and better then the waterpik</li>
            <li>This is a great accessory that helps me keep my mouth and teeth very, very clean.  </li>
            <li>It is incredible, my mouth and teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>It does a great job,  makes your teeth and mouth feel extremely clean!</li>
            <li>so I love it!</li>
            <li>I have found the first option works best.  </li>
            <li>On top of that they do not mention alcohol in the manual!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and effective.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>, I love it!</li>
            <li>Really love this product!</li>
            <li>My daughter had perfect dental hygiene appointments for the first 11 years of her life.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to register for the warranty and make sure you read the direction!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>What in ingenious idea!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, great for travel</li>
            <li>I think the greatest benefit for me, however, has been that the simplicity has allowed me, despite my resistance to flossing, to get into a positive routine.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and very effective.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>and they said they would be happy to send me a free replacement handle.  </li>
            <li>do a great job you can filled whit you prefered mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Good, intend to buy more</li>
            <li>Nice product,</li>
            <li>Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>In fairness, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I like using mouthwash in the reservoir, but water is effective too.</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>wife is as thrilled with it as I am.  </li>
            <li>Effective and easier to use than a flossing thread.</li>
            <li>I bought it on my dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and it&#x27;s every bit as handy as she said it is.</li>
            <li>How effective is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy another, but my wife really liked the product</li>
            <li>if there was some kind of warning - I could re-charge it before it gets to that</li>
            <li>Love how good my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li>I had always imagined that an air or water pick would not be as effective as floss.</li>
            <li>My wife and I purchased this flosser and liked them.</li>
            <li>While I liked my flosser, I hesitate to get another one because of the problems we have had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between teeth most of the time.</li>
            <li>I drained it and ran some warm water into the reservoir.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it flossed, but just quit working within 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I liked the device.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for the excellent and understanding customer service.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as tradition flossing.</li>
            <li>the water pick I now own.</li>
            <li>I have owned a number of the Philips Sonicare tooth brushes and liked the way they worked.  </li>
            <li>The three pronged attack is extremely effective against plaque.</li>
            <li>I used the waterpick for the longest time but since I liked the sonicare toothbrush, I thought to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I picked it up when I purchased my Philips Sonicare toothbrush and both of them together brings a very clean mouth!</li>
            <li>I found that using a bit of mouthwash in it along with water leaves a great clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Works great in getting gums clean.  </li>
            <li>This air flosser is one of the best new devices to save you a lot of money when you go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Best new product ever</li>
            <li>downside, make sure the flosshead is one secure or it will fly off.</li>
            <li>But the airfloss is a good way to floss anytime, anywhere and is even easy to carry in a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not as good as real  flossing, but this is something I&#x27;m happy to use daily--I never flossed</li>
            <li>Fortunately I wear glasses as it hits with quite a force that I don&#x27;t think would have pleasant in the eye....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great option for when there is a super contagious stomach virus going around our house</li>
            <li>Seller is good and got item very quickly.</li>
            <li>#34;any gadget that gets a patient to pay attention to interdental hygiene is better than nothing; none of them are as good as flossing; since most patients refuse to floss I recommend the gadget.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good for tooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and makes the teeth a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li>and the kids love flossing, better yet!</li>
            <li>This unit works fine, but I wonder if it does as good a job at getting plaque off  my teeth.</li>
            <li>Frankly, this experience has lowered my opinion of Philips products which I used to think were of great quality and worth the premium price.</li>
            <li>Fun works great feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>But, the Airfloss is certainly an important step to good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh as I use it with mouth wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than flossing - though honestly -</li>
            <li>It worked awesome for about 6 weeks, then stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I own one.</li>
            <li>Great and fun way to floss.</li>
            <li>All in all, gargling with water was more effective at getting the stuff out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The most honest seem to say &amp;</li>
            <li>As far as the results went, nothing impressive for that amount of money.</li>
            <li>I can easily find the spaces between my teeth!</li>
            <li>The Philips Airfloss Electric Flosser has a good amount of power to blast through and clean under the gumline.</li>
            <li>Airfloss, I loved the feeling of truly clean healed gums I was experiencing flossing with water.</li>
            <li>great product -- does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too..</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did make my gums bleed but after that it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well run and very comfortable</li>
            <li>Really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and understand, and effective.</li>
            <li>The Philips Flosser is quick and easy to use and is very effective.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, reasonable price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very important that we keep our gums healthy or we will lose teeth and</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great flossing system that is easy on the gums and does a great job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Purchased this after a dental visit, I love this item.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was more reliable.</li>
            <li>I love the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S</li>
            <li>I use either water or a combination of water and mouthwash to get between each and every tooth in my mouth, focusing on the areas where I have gold crowns that trap more food than I can believe.  </li>
            <li>I love this airflosser.</li>
            <li>Colored floss helps you see plaque build-up much better than floss</li>
            <li>Works perfect and we&#x27;ll likely purchase another.</li>
            <li>Would be even better if there were a way to adjust the water pressure.  </li>
            <li>I will make sure my orthodontist does not recommend this product again.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Phillips Sonicare flosser at Costco and was expecting something more like a water jet.</li>
            <li>It needs to be able to hold more mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I was mostly incorrect about that.  </li>
            <li>This product creates a &#x27;mist&#x27; of mostly air and some water/mouthwash that puffs between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Took many, many phone calls to get a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>if more than one person in your household will be using it.  </li>
            <li>more closely, it seems that it is glued together&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips is not a name for quality any more.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting concept that is not yet fully optimized.  </li>
            <li>The children love it and do it</li>
            <li>works even better than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I was able to floss everything in one go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>but, three stars for being better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>One more item to decorate your bathroom.</li>
            <li>make sure</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and it lasts more than a week after each charge.</li>
            <li>My mouth smelled so much better, it felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that I use it more times a day.</li>
            <li>This is a innovative idea in some sorts.</li>
            <li>I would suggest sticking with a good electric toothbrush like Philips Sonicare brand, but using the good old manual flossing.</li>
            <li>even more so because someone mentioned that they felt like &#x27;they just walked out the dentist office after a cleaning&#x27; after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item, it does all that the summary says it will do, I have recommended to friends</li>
            <li>This glossed is better than hand flossing any day.</li>
            <li>But as I reside in Mexico and I bought this on a trip to USA, the cost of shipping would be more than the value of the product.  </li>
            <li>Has motivated me to do a better job brushing too.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love this.</li>
            <li>If you want to test it, be sure to spit out the water it uses rather than swallow</li>
            <li>Much better than trying to floss with braces</li>
            <li>But for our kids, this is much better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of freshness afterwards, and I felt that it did a much better job than just brushing or even manual flossing.</li>
            <li>I have their cordless toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found that this item cleans the teeth just like flossing.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can load with mouthwash for even better results.</li>
            <li>The flosser does not work any more as the fluid/air leak at the joint of the flosser head and the replaceable tip.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting with this product, dentist recommending this to my wife.</li>
            <li>Thought I would be getting more for the money, or maybe I am using it incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Love my Philips Sonicare Airfloss.  </li>
            <li>I also LOVE that you can fill the reservoir with water or mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I regret that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>but it does a better job than anything else i have tried</li>
            <li>They also told him there was nothing more they could do for me.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it&#x27;s correct.</li>
            <li>Perfect for starting off the day.</li>
            <li>see that they sell replacement heads, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to have to replace them more often than recommended because the instructions say to rinse out after every use...</li>
            <li>maybe i am not using it correctly, pressing the button too many times, or battery</li>
            <li>Expect more of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve read about to keep healthy gums.</li>
            <li>This is ok</li>
            <li>We were already using Sonicare toothbrushes (and love them), so my husband agreed to give it</li>
            <li>Your dentists have better equipment and this is not even 2nd best.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 more for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li>Cleans and removes better than any dental floss.</li>
            <li>I love Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I find it encourages me to use the mouth wash more often since I can use mouth wash to floss my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll find out if my Dentist agrees in about 3 more months, but he is the one who recommended it</li>
            <li>I am not in love with how it feels when it squirts between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way that feels either, but I feel that I am getting a better cleaning with the floss rather than the water sports.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats dragging the floss between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>, flossing is better.</li>
            <li>Even after flossing, when I use the Airfloss, it finds more food particles.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>My dental appointments have been a lot better :)</li>
            <li>Needs more pressure</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this product it works magic on my mouth.</li>
            <li>Never had better check ups....</li>
            <li>My gums never felt so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this this device....</li>
            <li>can use your favorite mouth wash .</li>
            <li>I love, I have braces</li>
            <li>battery does not hold a charge more than 1 1/2 uses unless I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;re always looking for ways to make flossing easier and more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I feel a bit underwhelmed since I was hoping the effectiveness would be more on par with floss</li>
            <li>I have never found a better flosser.  </li>
            <li>But the Philips Sonicare flosser in conjunction with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is better than you can imagine.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for better service.</li>
            <li>Outlets are at a premium in most bathrooms</li>
            <li>Love this water pik, it works well with my teeth implants.</li>
            <li>I thought that this would be better, but after using it, I find that it just doesn&#x27;t get the job</li>
            <li>DO like it better than a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; which I have two</li>
            <li>Units works OK.  </li>
            <li>I threw out the box assuming it would be much much better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I would avoid these - or make sure you save your receipt.  </li>
            <li>am so relieved to have something I can use more than once a day along with brushing with an electric toothbrush to help with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast service and a great product.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I would&#x27;ve found this years ago.</li>
            <li>Flossing does much better.  </li>
            <li>My oral hygienist and my orthodontist&#x27;s office always compliment me on my healthy gums and oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>and we both love this.</li>
            <li>Better than floss and gets food out that nothing else can.</li>
            <li>I also was pleased with this product, however, agree the pressure shooting into my bridge was like a &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>As others have commented, it would be better if it held more liquid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really enjoyed using the product while it was working.</li>
            <li>I love the effectiveness-</li>
            <li>I was able to use mine around 10x&#x27;s before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel much better.</li>
            <li>Seems to work OK</li>
            <li>, I use the water pik which I love and this which was recommended by my dentist .</li>
            <li>Perhaps with time it will be better  </li>
            <li>pleased Phillips electric toothbrush user.</li>
            <li>I think it is the best device of its type on the market, but Philips obviously has manufacturing problems.  </li>
            <li>I love air flossing so much better then floss....</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommend this, claimed it was better than water flossed.  </li>
            <li>I love this electric flosser.  </li>
            <li>and you would probably be better off just hitting the button yourself.</li>
            <li>Love it-</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with this one.</li>
            <li>The product is just OK.</li>
            <li>also their electric toothbrush are the duo that I need for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Love them until they died within 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Love the  sonic care Flosser.</li>
            <li>Flossing would probably be more through but using this in my opinion is much better than doing nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but  I was always able to get a replacement of these non-working units.  </li>
            <li>These units are not user repairable with too many failures.  </li>
            <li>I make sure that I fill it with mouthwash that has no alcohol in it -</li>
            <li>I knew I had to floss to keep my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>three years, my checkups have been better.</li>
            <li>This device got me to take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Worked ok for three weeks.</li>
            <li>I use mouthwash and works great for fresh breath and clean mouth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very powerful!</li>
            <li>Nice addition to ability to clean around gumline.  </li>
            <li>works good, but does not hold very much water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great unit, and as long as its used in ADDITION to flossing, you will notice how clean and great it makes your mouth feel after every use.</li>
            <li>, very clean teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Together, your dental hygiene will be improved and your digestion will also thank you for keeping the first step of that process in good condition.</li>
            <li>Pretty darned good</li>
            <li>guess if you have pretty good flossing skills, you can skip this and do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good, cleans your teeth very well and makes you feel fresh, as if you just have some dental cleaning by the professionals.</li>
            <li>The new one worked great for about 5 uses and the switch once again became unresponsive.  </li>
            <li>The air floss electric flosser is easy to handle and a refreshing experience each day to maintain ones dental needs.</li>
            <li>I am, pleased with this product so easy to use.</li>
            <li>&amp; air blast are strong, i sometimes wonder whether the blast grind off my teeth after many years of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Easy to use  and love the chamber you can fill with mouthwash or water based on preference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it so many chances because when it works, I really like what a good job it does.</li>
            <li>After using it, I can see food particles that flossing missed, and it also leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean!  </li>
            <li>It works great and really does clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect especially if you want a fresh mouth and have healthy gums.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li>Fantastic help for healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I got it replaced here through Amazon, and everything so far has been great...</li>
            <li>Not as powerful and effective as I was hoping it would be.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take that much, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I fell it does not do as good a job as the water pick, but is much  easier to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy &amp; quick to use.</li>
            <li>This Airfloss makes it very easy and quick</li>
            <li>Just loved the Philips Sonicare Airfloss, makes your teeth feel so much cleaner , so easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy in that it is not connected to a huge water tank, but you run out of water fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I called them again and they will not replace it because the original unit was purchased more than 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand what all the complaining was about from some customers, but it is easy to use, and it does not &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; all over the place like some claimed.  </li>
            <li>Start gums bleed easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; Uber efficient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is easy to assemble-</li>
            <li>love the Airfloss because it doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore to do and the kids love having fun doing this without knowing all the benefits they are receiving.</li>
            <li>The Airfloss did a better job of keeping my teeth clean via this method, but after about 9 or 10 days, I still had to pull out the dental floss again and get the plaque out between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to knock over if you leave it standing on a countertop with or without the charger.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I will buy one for my office and one for the car since the one I have lives in the living room at home.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy and not as time consuming as using the floss thread.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and everyone in my family loves it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use (point the tip to the gaps between your teeth and push the button)</li>
            <li>It is so easy.</li>
            <li>, it is built well, sturdy, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t do that the tip flies out of the device.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic cover for water detaches from device too easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the flosser is easy.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So easy to floss and using the mouth wash</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and take care of.</li>
            <li>and I got great reviews at my most recent check-up.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews that you can easily break this.</li>
            <li>though I liked it very much I found the design bulky.  </li>
            <li>The flosser works fine, but it tips over easily when placed on the charger.</li>
            <li>Okay, that part is true.  </li>
            <li>My long years of night time teeth grinding has caused a lot of enamel loss as well as gum recession so this flosser wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.  </li>
            <li>My long years of night time teeth grinding has caused a lot of enamel loss as well as gum recession so this flosser wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.  </li>
            <li>For an oral irrigation device, this is a pretty nice alternative for people that don&#x27;t like flossing.  </li>
            <li>If the mouthwash is less strong than a Listerine, then you can use just mouthwash and it works and feels great!  </li>
            <li>Broke down (wouldn&#x27;t charge) once, but the Philips after sales service impressed me.</li>
            <li>Waterpik hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t practice good dental hygiene practice as a kid, so I got this as somewhat of a new year&#x27;s resolution to improve the state of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked fine for 2 months</li>
            <li>Should be fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, extremely easy to use although it took quite a bit of pressure to connect the head to the handle unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my dentist will be pleased as well.</li>
            <li>it works fine for four months, then fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They told him it&#x27;s in the fine print within the instructions.</li>
            <li>The dentist was impressed with the improvement and there was much less bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine while it lasted.</li>
            <li>The first unit had an issue with retaining a charge, however, second one works perfect.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these almost two years ago and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li>The one I wound up with is fine</li>
            <li>Seems to do a fine job of cleaning</li>
            <li>Once the fine print was available.to read.regarding the.operation..</li>
            <li>Price was fine.</li>
            <li>I have all crowns, an this product is super!  </li>
            <li>I still floss with tape, but this is a good quick floss when I can&#x27;t go the whole tape route; at night I even do both...</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about this air flosser is even though it does use water, or even mouth wash, it does not use large amounts.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Sleek and comfortable in the hand and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Great additional dental care (along with Sonicare brush and regular dental floss).  </li>
            <li>This device is not intended to take the place of your flossing, it&#x27;s a tool to stimulate the gums using water and force, forcing particles free of the teeth trap.  </li>
            <li>the part that held the mouth wash or water, flew off and cannot be found, it did this before, and i found it, but could not get it securely in place</li>
            <li>But as a suppliment to daily flossing this unit works great.  </li>
            <li>For people with bridgework, I would think a tool like this would be indispensable.  </li>
            <li>The power indicator light does not flash indicating either that the unit is charging or fully charged.</li>
            <li>Would make a great Christmas present!</li>
            <li>I just wished it would work, because it is very convenient and effective.  </li>
            <li>I have had my regular check-ups and cleanings and my gums are in great condition and no bleeding, so it is working quite well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used water flossers before, and my primary gripe about them is the water tank.</li>
            <li>The height and weight are important, in that I struggle each morning to activate the flosser.  </li>
            <li>and you really feel how effective it is</li>
            <li>Airfloss, which A (again), SONIC means sound and B</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it with mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I decided to allow it to stay connected and initiated a Chat session with Phillips Sonicare Customer Service after 12 hours with the charge light still not working.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare Airfloss is nicer than flossing manually, and it&#x27;s more powerful than a Hummingbird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this primarily with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s much more fun when it comes to flossing.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, with a dash of mouth wash in the appliance, I enjoy this method of &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; each night before bed.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is more fun</li>
            <li>or so is still cheap to save my gums, but then again I wasn&#x27;t planning on this being a subscription plan.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is my unit but the charging/ power light</li>
            <li>This air floss is worth every penny, it cleans between teeth so much better and softer than any string floss.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare brushes are such a joy to use so</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel entirely comfortable putting my fingers in my mouth to floss lest I get the virus in my system.</li>
            <li>I then use the Philips Flosser filled with ACT mouthwash.</li>
            <li>but I am unconvinced a 3rd replacement will make me happy.</li>
            <li>After using it nightly for 6 months, my gums were greatly improved at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Sonicare replaced that one free of charge,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Now I think it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap.......</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Has worked great for me for several months.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find any noticeable improvement over using just the Phillips Easy Clean Tooth Brush.</li>
            <li>Pressing the trigger just produces a buzzing sound but no results.  </li>
            <li>Worked for a month or so and was securely packed away during a move and once unpacked it never worked again.</li>
            <li>It makes a sound when the button is pushed but no water or even air comes out.</li>
            <li>type cleaner far superior</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starter tool - since it leaves the person experiencing the cleaner mouth, maybe it will lead to good hygiene and flossing technique with a regular, manual string, much like what the Hummingbird did for me years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought extra heads so the whole family can take advantage of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that real flossing is better for your teeth and gums, but for someone like me who has never been in the habit of flossing, this is much better than doing nothing besides brushing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband to help with sensitive gums at the recommendation of our dentist, and we both have loved it.  </li>
            <li>When the water truly shooting out, it hits my palm pretty strongly!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and something that doesn&#x27;t take long but gives great results.  </li>
            <li>But her teeth have been spotless for the first time in ages!!  </li>
            <li>So much easier than floss!!!</li>
            <li>I have made the use of this flosser part of my everyday evening routine and my gums look wonderful (they did do some bleeding at first but most of that has stopped with continued use).</li>
            <li>I have not missed a day using since I purchased it because it is so easy and quick.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quick and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>quick and easy</li>
            <li>Is a quick, easy way ro floss.</li>
            <li>This is so quick and easy, and I&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>After meals, a quick &amp;#34;go-around&amp;#34; with this flosser really works nice.  </li>
            <li>Love it, combined with my sonicare it makes your mouth feel &amp;#34;dentist office clean&amp;#34; easy to use very portable.</li>
            <li>This was great for 6 weeks, that&#x27;s how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>and there was still significant Plaque.</li>
            <li>I looked at one of at Target and then Bed Bath etc and the price was $90 plus tax, so Amazon&#x27;s  price of $60 was a significant discount.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I like that you can target between the teeth and make sure the mouthwash really gets in there!</li>
            <li>This is an update of my original review.</li>
            <li>My original unit stopped working after 10-12 weeks.</li>
            <li>The woman I talked to told me that even though I had registered the product they would need my original receipt to honor the warrantee at this time.</li>
            <li>I was at work and had originally registered the product, so I requested they review my registration.</li>
            <li>Love it when i first got it.</li>
            <li>If hard to floss with own hands, Philips Sonicare is a great substitute.</li>
            <li>However, I know that it&#x27;s important for gum/tooth health, and so I was SUPER excited to see this air floss option.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely clean between teeth.</li>
            <li>Lets be honest most people dont floss daily.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean around my implants, which I have two.</li>
            <li>My dentist said that traditional floss is much more effective and discouraged me from switching to the air flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought the Airfloss in Jan 2014 and my teeth have never felt as clean as they do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly, my teeth feel more refreshed after using regular floss to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend buying additional floss heads if you do purchase it - found them super cheap at amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling minty clean.</li>
            <li>However, my teeth do feel well clean and gums feel clean, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It also works well to clean around things like crowns, implants, veneers, etc.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth is so clean feeling if you use mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Product recommended to me by my dentist&#x27;s office to clean gum area around dental implants.</li>
            <li>- so my mouth doesn&#x27;t get clean that night -</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the power to clean properly&lt;br /&gt;between</li>
            <li>The great battery life has made it very convenient to take along for frequent business travel, even overseas.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This is really easy to use and gives my mouth a fresh feel.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t clean between my tooth and this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy for me to clean and keep my mouth fresh within 1 min</li>
            <li>/&gt;My nighttime tooth cleaning routine now leaves my teeth very nearly as clean as when I see the dentist.</li>
            <li>If you leave water in this device or if you don&#x27;t clean the head after every use you invalidate the warranty.</li>
            <li>Nothing has changed and I&#x27;m still complimented on how clean I keep my teeth and braces.  </li>
            <li>It feels amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>There was nothing to clean off that had been caught under the wire.  </li>
            <li>For that kind of money, it better last a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I like it because I can take it anywhere in the house and not be chained to the sink to clean in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The spaces between my teeth were never so clean.</li>
            <li>Air floss bursts are quick and powerful removing most leftover food quickly from between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Sure, you might say I should have just bucked up and been responsible about flossing in the first place, and that&#x27;s true, but this product has been more pleasant and significantly easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and has made me a daily flosser.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not positive that it&#x27;s just as effective as flossing, but over a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>Good machine, well designed, and works great, but too much jolting pressure against sensitive areas in the mouth with extensive dental work.  </li>
            <li>- in just 2 weeks I have experienced great improvement in my gums - had a couple of spots that were previously inflamed and the dentist told me to give extra attention to these areas.  </li>
            <li>nothing really special.</li>
            <li>fill this flosser with my special mouth rinse and go to town on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have to give special mention to Amazon, who replaced ours even though it was a bit over the return window.</li>
            <li>My son had brought his AirFloss for me to try, as I have special needs when trying to care for my teeth.</li>
            <li>So then I push the head right in between teeth and push the button, a lot of things came out, yay!</li>
            <li>so I knew it was working right!  </li>
            <li>Use it every day and it seems to do a good enough job at keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>otherwise, seems to being a very good job of cleaning in between the teeth-it isn&#x27;t as harsh as flossing and does not make your gums bleed like poking around with floss or brush pick</li>
            <li>I called Phillips who at first said just to clean it!  </li>
            <li>This funny gadget is easy to use and makes it almost fun to floss!  </li>
            <li>First, if you have closely spaced teeth, the device doesn&#x27;t seem to be as capable or effective cleaning between them.    </li>
            <li>Works pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>I bought the first at my dentist&#x27;s office and liked it so much that I used it after every meal since I work at home.  </li>
            <li>not that sure how much the mist cleans.</li>
            <li>My mouth didn&#x27;t feel super clean after using this.</li>
            <li>Cool Mint Flavor Floss 40 M</li>
            <li>Phillips is true to its brand</li>
            <li>I filled up the reservoir with mouthwash, and try to put the spout in between teeth and this flosser squirts out with force the mouthwash, and my mouth does feel fresh and renovated.</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple of weeks ago and thought it did a good job - but it only lasted TWO WEEKS.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dentist but the product does not even do as good a job as simply rinsing one&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li>Good for your gums and basic oral wellnesd.</li>
            <li>Cool Mint Mouthwash x 500ml]].</li>
            <li>This air floss seems like a good idea however, you need regular flossing</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>SWEET.</li>
            <li>Good product, but only issue is that it can&#x27;t replace the battery....</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as good as an actual string floss.</li>
            <li>Once you become accustomed to the quick bursts you can feel an improved clean feeling after each use.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good complement to my regular dental hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>The whole process reminds me a lot of the Waterpik I used many years ago when I had braces.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>For better plaque and debris removal just get a real oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>Every day my mouth is full of blood.</li>
            <li>Shape pretty easy to use and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this Airfloss after first checking out the other electronic flossing devices (water based ones), and decided this one seemed to fit my needs best considering there isnt much involved to get this thing going (no connecting to water lines or filling tanks with water).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many people complain about how this is not as good as using string floss, and I would agree that if you have a particle of food stuck between your teeth above the gum line, using regular floss to remove it might be a better solution, but this product is absolutely perfect for me and has made a huge difference already, despite having only been used for a short time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I floss daily because it makes my teeth and gums feel healthy, but this flosser is a good second line of defense to make sure I get all the areas between my teeth.</li>
            <li>The quality of this unit is not what I have experienced from other Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li>Works good but could use a little more horse power.</li>
            <li>I can floss my teeth just as quickly as it takes to get between all the teeth with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick but not as thorough as a water pik.</li>
            <li>I used the quick start guide which said use water or mouthwash, nothing about alcohol.</li>
            <li>I asked why they have a Quick Start guide if you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it.</li>
            <li>All they had to do was make a note in the Quick Start guide about non alcohol.</li>
            <li>In my review I objected to the fact that Canadians can use the Philips USA support site, but south of the border, we are not so lucky.  </li>
            <li>This flosser is super.  </li>
            <li>Inside the blister pack you will find the device, its AC charging dock, and paperwork (quick start guide, longer guide, registration).</li>
            <li>So many reviews were bad--mostly claiming that the pressure is too low and flossing or the Waterpick are better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this can be a useful part of your dental care, but I&#x27;m going to stick with the good &#x27;ole fashioned flossing for the time being.</li>
            <li>so this is a painless and quick alternative for me.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows the importance of flossing but most dentists will tell you most people don&#x27;t do enough of it.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I was wearing my glasses or else</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;works&#x27; between some of my back teeth, but my front teeth both top and bottom are more crowded, and this stops Airfloss in its tracks.</li>
            <li>Now that my gums are better conditioned, the pressure doesn&#x27;t feel as high, but I know it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to whom want to have healthier mouth and better teeth</li>
            <li>Philips Airfloss is more of a tool for those with dental work preventing normal flossing.  </li>
            <li>Use it ,its very much!</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased with how the AirFloss works, and look forward to what my dental hygienist thinks when I go next time.</li>
            <li>The sensation is not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing a much better job of flossing than I do, even though I use regular floss right before I use this.</li>
            <li>I am thankful Sonicare offers an easily used unit!</li>
            <li>ON A SCALE 1-10 the product rate as a 10, highly recommend, overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best floss more convenient, the only bad side about it was I used to own one but after using it for more than 3 months it just broke</li>
            <li>male, and loved the first Sonicare I had.  </li>
            <li>This Electric Flosser really does the job so easily</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product which does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>The best , just 30 seconds to do the whole mouth, much much easier that regular flossing, better results than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much time &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li>sent all back for replacements from Sonicare, one more try!</li>
            <li>It is Exactly what I wanted,, and got it a lot cheaper from here !  </li>
            <li>Will send it back and hope to get a better one!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Totally changed my habit and I love floss now!</li>
            <li>It doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do</li>
            <li>doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do</li>
            <li>For me, while I absolutely love my recently acquired Sonicare \\&quot;Easy Clean\\&quot; toothbrush, the \\&quot;airfloss\\&quot; was not the solution I was searching for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you are like me and get four cleanings a year from your dentist and LOVE having a clean mouth, floss every day and want that EXTRA clean feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you are like me and get four cleanings a year from your dentist and LOVE having a clean mouth, floss every day and want that EXTRA clean feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it goes long term - but so far so good!</li>
            <li>but I enjoy using it and certainly have cleaner teeth.  </li>
            <li>works fine, but I think it should hold a bit more fluid than it does.</li>
            <li>Not painful and very much like a gum massage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s more effective than using floss, but you can use with mouthwash and leaves you with a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>thought the Philips will have the same idea but with lithium power and the amazing sonicare charging cradle which i can use for both my sonicare tooth brush and the</li>
            <li>enjoy using it - enough fluid in dispenser for one thorough cleanse great, with a bit of mouth wash leaves mouth feeling ggod</li>
            <li>absolutely should become comfortable with positioning the tool, so as not to shoot downward and harm your gum</li>
            <li>&quot; I expect it to replace traditional flossing as an equally effective way of flossing your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>This is far more fun.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful handheld electronic device.</li>
            <li>Though the idea may sound interesting, flossing regularly and using a sonicare, to me, Does the job between the gums, though I still use a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>It may not be 100% as effective as flossing, but compared to 0% flossing, this is a definite improvement for my dental health.</li>
            <li>Fun to squirt at wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but your mouth will feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>Really powerful.</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>and I think this product is worth the price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever purchasing anything else from this company even if the product ultimately proves acceptable.  </li>

            <li>husband has also had success with the Airfloss.  </li>
            <li>Took a bit of time to get it but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Quite powerful and long-lasting charge.</li>
            <li>They are very happy with how it cleans as expected and use it daily after tooth brishing with the Diamond Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>The Airfloss uses the same charger that my Sonicare toothbrush uses so that is handy.</li>
            <li>door.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a month I can say it is worth using.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist had me purchase one for her, as my gums and teeth have never looked better, and I&#x27;m 70 years old, with no</li>
            <li>but if you have problems with floss it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really powerful, so</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Quite a powerful blast.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t charge well and is now useful.</li>
            <li>It claims to have 2 uses or 2 days worth (I forget)</li>
            <li>it is it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle at over $100</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also messy, lots of water everywhere, although being able to use mouthwash in the reservoir was nice.</li>
            <li>so much more comfortable than regular flossing!</li>
            <li>My dentist heard about this product and said it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>Not so good as expected.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning in between teeth provided that you don&#x27;t have too much cap work; otherwise, the product isn&#x27;t going to match the cleaning power of a regular flossing.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product, as electric toothbrushes have been around for a while, but an electric flosser is pretty new.</li>
            <li>dental technology becomes more practical and portable in the home, I&#x27;m always interested in new products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result was a very fresh mouth, much like one had gargled with mouthwash.</li>
            <li>replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest version of the Airfloss is slightly different from the original.</li>
            <li>one would hope they would not fail so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have been very serious about my oral health for many years and this product is great.  </li>
            <li>It is apparent this unit won&#x27;t last more than 10 months to don&#x27;t buy it, it is a rip off and will cost you just under $10 a month to own.</li>
            <li>I feel like I flossed for the very first time when I first used this.</li>
            <li>Love it really gets between the teeth highly recommend</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t right to do to us consumers.</li>
            <li>you turn the power on, and then put the Airfloss in between your teeth right at the gum.  </li>
            <li>You push the trigger button and it pushes the air right in.  </li>
            <li>it would have hit me right in the eye!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>With nerve damage to my right arm, and neuropathy in both hands, the waterpik</li>
            <li>Love it, teeth and gums feel amazing everyday!</li>
            <li>Still feel as though I need to really floss to acheive a truly clean effect.  </li>
            <li>This works so fast that you could easily use it 2-3 times a day just before brushing and could add more \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; to your daily routine in this way.</li>
            <li>whole my mouth feel really clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much gentler way to clean between teeth</li>
            <li>This really helps with getting my teeth fully clean.  </li>
            <li>Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser really seems to floss you teeth &#x27;dental hygienist&#x27; clean in seconds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the process takes much longer than 30 seconds, based on operation, technique, repeating and clean</li>
            <li>but alas it seems either more experience using the device will make one more adept or perhaps it&#x27;s more of a supplement to brushing and flossing regularly.  </li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth I use the flosser and it really cleans between the teeth and makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Have to stand over the sink, and makes such a mess, but they are great for healthy gum tissue.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty neat since you can place your favorite mouthwash in it and blast the plaque between your teeth; that said, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s effective enough or even quick enough to replace flossing.</li>
            <li>I was already a huge fan of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and had high hopes for this, but it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I used it with TheraBreath Professional Oral rinse and my mouth feels really clean as well!</li>
            <li>Works great but the reservoir cover broke after a few uses!</li>
            <li>My hygienist reports that the pocket has gone from 5 to 4 mm, and my gums look better in general.  </li>
            <li>So, this is messier than flossing, though almost certainly more sanitary as long as you keep the tip clean.</li>
            <li>A piece of food that is stuck in the gum, such a skin from an apple didn&#x27;t pop right out, this seems to be more useful for plaque between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is effective, but compared to the WaterPik I am used to using it is slow and ineffecient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing kinda Spits a powerful infectious blast in between, But I honestly only felt it at the top.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of these people, there is a good chance that the Sonicare is going to do more for your oral hygiene than a cursory or poor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s easy to use and</li>
            <li>: Well it&#x27;s been around a year and a half of consistently good cleanings.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this to anyone who has braces and has problems getting their teeth clean with a brush and waterpik.</li>
            <li>I was actually in the market for a Waterpick when I decided this would be a lot more convenient, and I think I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li>Pretty strong force but works as expected and gets my teeth, in between, clean!</li>
            <li>That is very fortunate since I am on my second air flosser.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t feel that it completely replaces floss, but it does such a good job of cleaning that I feel safe just using this as a substitute for a couple days at a time.  </li>
            <li>think if a company really wants to sell a product they shouldn&#x27;t really use the name of their better products to affiliated a new line, even though its in the Oral Care category, There is nothing &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; about it.</li>
            <li>It would probably be fine for others but not for my sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>It just provides a quick spritz of water mist, no where near enough to be effective @</li>

            <li>It does a pretty good job and is very easy to use but not better than actually flossing.  </li>
            <li>It works if you are consistent.</li>
            <li>Bought this first for myself and husband...then bought them as gifts for children.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>My first time using this Airfloss</li>
            <li>but I wish the water reservoir held more water so that I do not have to keep filling up in the middle of using the product.</li>
            <li>I received it as promised and it work exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>The Airflosser works very well and is quite powerful.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, you WILL spray the bathroom mirror by accident.</li>
            <li>I love this product,but my first one only workeD for 3 years.</li>
            <li>It runs out of water before I&#x27;m able to cover the front and the back of all my teeth.</li>
            <li>It may take more than 30 seconds to use this device on your entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I accidentally dropped the first and broke it after 2 years).</li>
            <li>Love this as an alternative to regular flossing!</li>
            <li>When I first received my Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li>So they sold me this airfloss afterwards and told me &amp;#34;brush first with toothpaste, then use it.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It seems to work as advertised, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell what real good it does.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I was dedicated, I used it once to twice a day</li>
            <li>I got my first one through my dentist, I followed all the instructions, and I did not use it as a throwing toy or baseball bat in any way.  </li>
            <li>I had to dunk it in water, because the battery was getting so hot</li>
            <li>first bought a Sonicare Elite in 2005, and my teeth had never felt cleaner in my life.  </li>
            <li>It is one more thing to keep plugged in on your bathroom countertop, and I really do not see the true benefit of the device.</li>
            <li>unlike the first model.  </li>
            <li>being said, I can tell you this thing definitely does not feel as refreshing as when I walk out of my dentist office.</li>
            <li>But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.t</li>
            <li>But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li>ok, So, my aunt actually bought me this thing.</li>
            <li>In the first case, the battery died within 6 months.  </li>
            <li>that will help them develop a better way to fill the chamber and an appreciation for a larger chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Philips did replace my first</li>
            <li>After the initial 24 hours charing, the battery was able to last for more than 1 week, on one use per day basis.</li>
            <li>I tried it by flossing with my Glide floss first.  </li>
            <li>What a piece of crab for so much money!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not only refreshing, but</li>
            <li>When I first used this,I thought it was garbage.  </li>
            <li>It did and I don&#x27;t have to have the planing and scaling--not only saving me hundreds of dollars, but giving me an easier way to maintain healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>used water first, then switched to mouthwash as the product suggests.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would come with several floss tips so that more than one person could use it.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to charge it for 24 hours for the first time</li>
            <li>(the first charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>works real well and makes you want to floss every day!</li>
            <li>but sometimes it won&#x27;t work when I first turned it on and after hold the button for a moment while its still on the charger for it to stay on after I remove it.</li>
            <li>I like the Airfloss so much better than traditional floss...</li>
            <li>it starts charging... very convenient!  </li>
            <li>However, the first airfloss stopped working after about a month.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much I am having fun using this</li>
            <li>My dentist and I love this, but still need to use in conjunction with traditional flossing</li>
            <li>The first week or two it made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>If the pressure was higher, I would not use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I had my first cleaning since buying it.</li>
            <li>Overall I was impressed with the Power Flosser which I will be using on a twice daily basis in future.</li>
            <li>For example, a tooth pick form a Chinese resteraunt is better than this product.</li>
            <li>I can use this flosser instead and feel it&#x27;s more likely that I won&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>Flossing has never been so much easier !</li>
            <li>And with the mouthwash, it keeps my breath feeling fresh for much longer than just brushing.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my family, it cleans pretty well</li>
            <li>But today was the first time I have used it.</li>
            <li>It gushes a lot more fluid than the Airfloss so using mouthwash is not practical.</li>
            <li>think this does a better job when you have a tiny bit of space between your teeth.</li>
            <li>I used my first one 2 years and then it would not recharge</li>
            <li>She is aware of my many physical limitations and has tried to find ways to help me.</li>
            <li>Many dentists recommend it because of the Sonicare name; definitely hasn&#x27;t lived up to that name.</li>
            <li>At first water just splashed  all over me when I used it.  </li>
            <li>the first two days she jumped every time she set off the jet</li>
            <li>I have returned mine and ordered a different brand with more options.</li>
            <li>First the flap holding the mouthwash broke off, only partially able to return to functioning.  </li>
            <li>(I recommend reading the directions first rather than just trying it)</li>
            <li>Gets more out between the teeth than regular floss.</li>
            <li>With the correct technique it is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li>Evidently I have not learned to keep all the media inside my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Water Pik is ten times better.</li>
            <li>Whenever I tried to use the standard water irrigator, I would gag and choke most every time.  </li>
            <li>I have minimized this by make sure to close my lips as much as possible but it can still spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found the price to be better that the local stores.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for the same reason most others seem to have bought it:</li>
            <li>It does an OK job with the &#x27;surface&#x27; cleaning but does not work at all for the deep cleaning (I still need to use floss).</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li>The first one died because I was using mouthwash instead of water in it...</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The problem from the first one was a crack on the body I got after accidental drop from the sink three times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to but after that it&#x27;s easy and so much better that string.</li>
            <li>High quality, Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.  </li>
            <li>She was right; this is so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I made sure that I was giving the Airfloss a fair chance by being very careful and going over every space two or three times until the reservoir was empty and still got debris with the Water-pic.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money to know that I am helping my cause of trying to keep as many of my teeth as possible when I get older.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, it has pushed me back into traditional flossing on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work okay with all of them, but it&#x27;s hard to know for sure without some pretty close dental examination.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain the 2nd generation will be even better.  </li>
            <li>I have used about 2 sonicare electric toothbrushes in the last ten years, absolutely worth the investment, worth every single penny, and the latest versions DO actually clean better than older versions!</li>
            <li>To clean your teeth with it, you have to put the tip at the gum line between the teeth and keep moving it to direct spray between the teeth.</li>
            <li>A solid enhancement to a regular program of good dental care.  </li>
            <li>When you push the button on top the nozzle will blow out a strong puff of air, along with a small jet of water or mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten positive remarks from my dentist.</li>
            <li>It has been a positive experience.</li>
            <li>so I expect a positive review of my oral health.</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth did not feel clean after using it (other than the fresh clean of the mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son puts a little water or mouthwash in it and is able to clean in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>First try, it did hurt, but I was jamming it in between my teeth too much.</li>
            <li>I got my first oral-B Hummingbird Flosser (since discontinued), which truly taught me to appreciate how much cleaner my gums felt after flossing.</li>
            <li>When I first used this cleaner it did not feel as it was doing much.</li>
            <li>And the reservoir is way too small -- it is good for about two uses before it has to be refilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I have dropped off how much I use traditional floss, but the current routine seems to get me good reviews every time I see the hygienist.</li>
            <li>This product is good if you&#x27;re too lazy to floss.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean and my mouth so fresh since I have been using it for the last 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li>Air flossing mechanism is very strong and definitely not for use by those with sensitive teeth or gums even though it says it&#x27;s gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality of floss with this machine is not probably on par with traditional flossers, but this is very fast and comfortable to use</li>
            <li>This new one is working fine so far.  </li>
            <li>Less effective than water floss.</li>
            <li>The blister pack is easy to open without tools by separating the two interlocking parts.</li>
            <li>A quick google search will render a class action suit for this product.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are pricey, but do seem to last a good long while.  </li>
            <li>reservoir is more than half used up in a single treatment; effectively you must refill it each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just certain areas have always bled)</li>
            <li>Perhaps I implied that there was a design flaw in the product - I certainly believe it, so maybe it came across in my review</li>
            <li>Just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t being fooled</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums and the flosser really is too powerful and makes my gums bleed and hurt.</li>
            <li>I t was working fine until July 2nd when battery died and I place flosser on charger.</li>
            <li>This is the main reason I&#x27;m not rating it higher.</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t replace manual flossing altogether, but it certainly makes it much, much easier</li>
            <li>Put warm water and a little Listerine in there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve manually flossed after use of the Airfloss several times and the floss has come out pretty much clean each time.</li>
            <li>It likely does it in a more uniform and effective way than floss, particularly if you are not a skilled flosser.</li>
            <li>There is definitely room for user error to become an issue in how accurately this works.</li>
            <li>I really like this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the Water Pik, which I did not like at all.  </li>
            <li>So much quicker than flossing and mouth feels cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected however it can use more power...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seam to be cleaning between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It really does get and food particles out from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really replace the need for string flossing.  </li>
            <li>I really like the AirFloss.  </li>
            <li>The AirFloss works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t string floss at all you really must get this.</li>
            <li>If you held the power button on it would work, but you can&#x27;t really use it with both hands.</li>
            <li>really like the unit.</li>
            <li>There is no pain, and the whole experience is over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So that alone tells me it’s not doing a capable job.  </li>
            <li>Works better than i expected.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it as much,</li>
            <li>and then I keep as much of the peroxide in my mouth and then brush my teeth with my Sonicare Elite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>works really well.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their teeth for life.</li>
            <li>cuz who ever does that, really?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I expected more.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return it because I threw the whole thing in the trash.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was not helpful and very arrogant.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at how well it did.</li>
            <li>My dentist highly recommends this product and so do I!,</li>
            <li>Can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips...for nothin</li>
            <li>It works very well and the convenience of having a flosser at hand can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>you get a kickback that wets your whole chest area.  </li>
            <li>really wanted this to work because it&#x27;s cordless and has the air in the spurt.  </li>
            <li>This does the job very well when it works correctly, but it is very tempermental ands</li>
            <li>Purchased this product and it has really helped improve my gum issues...</li>
            <li>made my gum bleed, very awarkard to use.</li>
            <li>Dislodges food particles gently.</li>
            <li>Fast and convenient to use</li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer my water pic coupled with ultra texture floss.  </li>
            <li>caught my eye, but I didn&#x27;t really know what an air flosser was.  </li>
            <li>Does a better job than I expected.</li>
            <li>Would highly reco to all!</li>
            <li>It really gets the stuff between</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li>so i really like it.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare airfloss is so much easier than flossing and quicker too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ten-Twenty minutes later, the blinking charge light stopped blinking.  </li>
            <li>I really like the concept of the charging system.</li>
            <li>it seems to work because the dental hygenist doesnt complain about my gums as much as she used to.</li>
            <li>And, no gum bleeding by accidently applying too much</li>
            <li>and they were very understanding.</li>
            <li>the Philips Sonicare HX6921/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush (which I really like)</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a game changer like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased</li>
            <li>It works very well, stays charged.  </li>
            <li>so I was very keen to try it out.</li>
            <li>The idea of a device, in appearance very like an electric toothbrush, which does the job is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use mouthwash in the reservoir and it feels very thorough</li>
            <li>and it will burst streams of mouthwash between your teeth for a much cleaner and fresher feel.</li>
            <li>Recharge stand is very unstable when the flosser is attached.</li>
            <li>It would be marginally better than not flossing at all but just shooting a burst of mouthwash in between your teeth is not a real substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li>I use a Waterpik as part of my routine and that is capable of cleaning under the gums around all surfaces of the tooth.</li>
            <li>Either mouthwash or water can be poured into the reservoir and it shoots out in a gentle stream when the button is pressed.</li>
            <li>This leaves me feeling very minty.</li>
            <li>It really does help getting food particles out between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you still have to use real floss</li>
            <li>and of course that doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much to replace when it</li>
            <li>We used this maybe 10 times before the charging light went out and never came back on again!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>We used this maybe 10 times before the charging light went out and never came back on again!</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use than manuel flossing or using a Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>this is much quicker than flossing.  </li>
            <li>really cleans out the spaces between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It removed a lot of additional debris that I probably couldn&#x27;t reach very well with floss.  </li>
            <li>: But if you don&#x27;t floss, then this is probably better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing: You&#x27;d be better off buying a Sonicare toothbrush, floss and mouthwash and just using them properly</li>
            <li>This product rocks really.</li>
            <li>I gave it many tries and still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels much cleaner since I have been using this device.  </li>
            <li>this works really well</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use then</li>
            <li>You know you don&#x27;t really floss.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than the tank flossers.</li>
            <li>The pack was opened before, very obviousely.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>and I also really like</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I do see a noticeable difference where plague does not build up as much. s</li>
            <li>i cannot find a place to by the part, i love it otherwise, especially with a fixed retainer wire...,,,,</li>
            <li>It is kind of a pain to set up, and in my humble opinion</li>
            <li>I used a waterpick back in the early 70&#x27;s and it seemed to me to work every bit as well or better than the Sonicare product.</li>
            <li>airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;The way the Airfloss works is by single pulses of very little mist and mostly air which does not come close in my opinion to the effective Waterpik way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, the product pretty much works as advertised, and will deliver a sharp burst of water right between your teeth to help clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A big plus is that it leaves my mouth feeling very fresh, and not just like I used mouthwash by itself.</li>
            <li>As others have said, it worked great for as long as it lasted--which for me was less than three months.  </li>
            <li>Different sites favor one or the other and sound equally convincing.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 2 years - can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li>Works just as well as other brands, but not as great as expected.</li>
            <li>Did not find product easy to use  instructions not clear will have to consult with dentist on hoe to use .</li>
            <li>I very surprised the first time I used it at how well it cleaned.</li>
            <li>You will be left with a very minty clean</li>
            <li>The air flosser I originally got from Phillips stopped working after I had it for only a couple of months.</li>
            <li>They only go by the original purchase.  </li>
            <li>One gentleman is on his FOURTH unit - and your warranty is not reset every time; it remains the day of original purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is always a good idea to ask your dentist before using things like this, especially if you have work in progress or any other special situations or on-going issues and such.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is I really like sonicare products, and in general believe they make good stuff, but unfortunately I think that this particular device is ill-conceived and probably is not going to be used by many people.</li>
            <li>You would still need to use traditional dental floss to clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean between teeth well enough.</li>
            <li>No way will a burst of water clean like the physical &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; you get with floss.</li>
            <li>nearly $100 isn&#x27;t worth it to replace normal floss.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean especially when I use mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li>This tool has one function; to clean in-between teeth from the front only with a burst of air and water or mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The unit did get the areas between my teeth clean in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you not only clean out the spaces in the bridge</li>
            <li>These things are amazing, and in my case, corrected problems with my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use alcohol-based mouthwash in mine, and in very little time my &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; under my gums began to shrink.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long and is incredibly important.</li>
            <li>The unit is comfortable to hold and keeps its charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I liked the small size and wireless option.  </li>
            <li>Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser is not a replacement for true flossing (with actual floss).</li>
            <li>It was able to clean between my teeth that had larger gaps, but did a poor job on tighter spaces that were already filled with a bit of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The area at the top that you press down to activate it would not budge.  </li>
            <li>So I went to their website, reported the problem, spoke to someone in the chat thing, and within a week they had sent me a new one!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product new and received it USED!  </li>
            <li>New concept, works very well.  </li>
            <li>Love one previously purchased.</li>
            <li>box advertises the air flosser \\&quot;removes up to 5x more plaque between teeth\\&quot; - but the tiny print at the bottom indicates that the comparison is between the air flosser and brushing your teeth, not the air flosser and traditional floss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two buttons--a main power button and the button to activate the air/water pulse.  </li>
            <li>Ok, So second test, Floss regularly, sonicare, then Airfloss.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much more likely to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>That may indeed be a decent product; however, the two products together rival my monthly car payment in cost.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with this item is the flimsy hinge on the door of the water compartment.</li>
            <li>You can probably get better results with traditional flossing, with a similar time investment.</li>
            <li>I only need a bigger reservoir, because I always have used more than one time between my teeths</li>
            <li>The main problem appears to be the battery and the execution of the &amp;#34;air flossing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>FOLLOWING UP MANY MONTHS LATER</li>
            <li>It only has very short periodic bursts of fluid/air pressure which do not seem to do much - glad</li>
            <li>For those of us with crooked teeth where traditional floss would get caught up and rip, this is a better option.</li>
            <li>Very hard to use and doesn&#x27;t feel good in the mouth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare flosser for everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>just start making a high pitched whine and then do nothing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this flosser and will never be without one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>As a dentist, I highly recommend this product to all my patients.</li>
            <li>, I tried explaining that these have a high rate of defects and they denied it.</li>
            <li>Also, I tried explaining that these have a high rate of defects and they denied it.</li>
            <li>with that issue I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...just like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Minor clean up required.  </li>
            <li>I found other posts on Sonicare&#x27;s own web site that reported similar nozzle failures.  </li>
            <li>DOESN&amp;#34;T APPEAR TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING</li>
            <li>I floss more often now because of ease of use and little fuss to use.</li>
            <li>There are no exposed metal pieces and the charging station looks like little more than a plastic peg.</li>
            <li>I tried a few more times and heard a loud **POP!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, and makes my mouth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Electric Flosser&amp;#34; is a modern twist on the old &amp;#34;Waterpics&amp;#34; you might remember from the 70&#x27;s and 80s.</li>
            <li>it leaves a much cleaner feeling and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my gums as sensitive to the burst of air that the Airflosser generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much easier than the old floss string.</li>
            <li>Anyhow the customer service young man at Phillips was very helpful and understanding had my replacement sent out immediately</li>
            <li>when doing it and painful so this airfloss is perfect</li>
            <li>Better dental exams in just a few months.</li>
            <li>This Electric Flosser will not make you dispense the normal dental floss.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t bring yourself to use traditional floss, this is worth considering.  </li>
            <li>I normally brush, floss and use the pick, then mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I tried couple of times first, it didn&#x27;t really work for various reasons...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it does a good job flushing out the food that a brush would miss.</li>
            <li>While I would say that using this is better than nothing, I definitely would not completely substitute the Airfloss for flossing.  </li>
            <li>While I would say that using this is better than nothing, I definitely would not completely substitute the Airfloss for flossing.  </li>
            <li>You have to charge it for 24 hrs before first use, and wait for the indicator light to turn green.</li>
            <li>I put mouthwash in the well of the flosser for better cleaning, however it was quite messy, as the pulse type button shoots the liquid between your teeth</li>
            <li>However, I found that even if I first used a brush, this device removed much food particles still left.</li>
            <li>that If you don&#x27;t normally floss, that you will be &amp;#34;more inclined&amp;#34; to use a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;(only you can answer that question)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: use normal floss or get a waterpik.</li>
            <li>Then there they went through the list of trouble shooting questions, including some questions that were beyond comical.  </li>
            <li>Although I have had problems in the past with my first one the customer service was awesome and they always took care of it very quickly without making you feel bad.</li>
            <li>A water-pik works better, IMO, and for half the price!</li>
            <li>Over more usage I did find that I ended up using this twice a day (not that I&#x27;d ever floss twice a day), and in the morning I preferred to use the mouthwash in the reservoir, while at night I ended up using plain water.</li>
            <li>Now it never stops right in the middle of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flosser was very effective in removing the debris and running my tongue around my mouth afterwards I was unable to detect any remaining meat.</li>
            <li>This means that if your teeth are really close together, are crooked, or overlap, you will not get the full benefits of flossing (i.e., getting into every nook and cranny to get every last bit of the food particles that the brush missed).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first few attempts, I finally mastered using this flosser without spritzing most of the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I told my Hygienist about this new flosser and she may recommend the flosser to others.</li>
            <li>buy a new toy</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one, because mine died after 2 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(and a new nozzle)</li>
            <li>They mailed me a new one</li>
            <li>I was told to wait for a new Airflosser which should arrive in 2-3 days and use the enclosed label and the box the new Airflosser came in to return my cracked Airflosser.  </li>
            <li>The new Airflosser arrived and I returned the cracked one.</li>
            <li>Maybe they should have a replaceable battery as to replace with new unit</li>
            <li>I purchased a new one from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without one .</li>
            <li>See if the unit lasted some two years, I might tolerate repairing or buying a new unit.</li>
            <li>Had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>While I am glad the phone representative understood my issue and seems to have resolved it, I have no assurance that my device was really new and not a refurbished/repackaged return from someone who spent some time charging the device prior to returning it.  </li>
            <li>your mouth is closed all the way around the end BEFORE you press the button, otherwise you will need some Windex to clean the spray off your mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but according to some reviewers, it DOES do at least as good a job as traditional flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If its low on charge, the light turns yellow.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for some people who have advanced gum disease with deep pockets around the teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting a little wet for healthy gums.</li>
            <li>husband has one too and loves his.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback--we each have our own because the individual sticks are not easy to change.</li>
            <li>The first one broke after 3 months, and the second broke after 5 months.</li>
            <li>I would even go so far as to say that Phillips is overly optimistic with their two year warranty!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was actually working</li>
            <li>For the first time, bleeding, big impact</li>
            <li>However the first one died within 6 months the second died yesterday.  </li>
            <li>It works consistently, and I use it once or twice daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that I found more food particles and \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; between my teeth using this,</li>
            <li>After 10-12 weeks the first replacement broke and we started using the second.</li>
            <li>I explained that their product obviously does not last for more than 10 months and that they need to fix the obvious flaw it has in its design.  </li>
            <li>...otherwise suck it up and floss the old fashioned way!  </li>
            <li>Even if the price over time pays for itself in actual disposable floss purchases (which is why I was intrigued in the first place).  </li>
            <li>I chose this Sonicare Airfloss Flosser because I&#x27;ve enjoyed Sonicare products in the past</li>
            <li>After three months it completely died!  </li>
            <li>The Airfloss works pretty well, but only works from the front of the teeth.</li>
            <li>After using this for the first time, I only wished I&#x27;d started using it sooner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good complement to flossing or better than not flossing for those times when you might worry that your hands can&#x27;t be cleaned well enough to be germ-free and you don&#x27;t want to risk getting sick.</li>
            <li>So, I am using it every other day to ensure I can get a quality clean.  </li>
            <li>I use water rather than mouthwash, preferring to swish some mouthwash around following flossing, and I have noticed a significant change in my overall oral sensitivity and the infrequent bleeding I used to experience when flossing has gone away completely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they were sending out used or refurbished units, but why replace a new design with the old design?  </li>
            <li>that said, the Philips Airfloss is STILL a very useful tool for helping you maintain healthy teeth and gum -- when it&#x27;s used as PART of a dental care regime like using mouthwash, brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily (with traditional floss), and visiting your dentist for checkup/cleaning every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and isn&#x27;t as messy as a waterpik.</li>
            <li>When I last went to the dentist, I was advised to be sure that I ran the floss up and down both sides of adjacent teeth</li>
            <li>Original review:  &amp;#34;I have had major gum problems even though I spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning, flossing waterpicking, etc...</li>
            <li>I have a bridge with two teeth missing and flossing under this is easy and complete with the Water-pic, but the Airfloss just doesn&#x27;t seem to work in these spaces.</li>
            <li>After a few times just fine.</li>
            <li>Wish the reservoir were about four times as large, needs several refills during a cleaning session.</li>
            <li>Literature claims reservoir is large enough for 1 or 2 uses.</li>
            <li>Also it takes twice as long to use this product as you have to clean both the inside and outside of your teeth.</li>
            <li>Although a little expensive, this flosser workes great!!.</li>
            <li>There was hardly any tarter between my teeth and my gums look a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was going to be more like the old water pick, but the little burst of water is just not enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Tiny puffs of air don&#x27;t seem to clean anything, and if you use dental floss after &amp;#34;wind flossing&amp;#34; you quickly realize how little cleaning is actually taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flossing is better for you; it removes more of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li>Instructions do not make it clear that tip must be pushed into device until it snaps in place</li>
            <li>&quot; gets a solid 3 stars from our household.e too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the reviews were paid for by the vendors.</li>
            <li>Clearly these are defective and break after a month or so.</li>
            <li>Far inferior to dental flossing.</li>
            <li>I use either the automatic repeat action or take my time and press the activating button as I insert the tip between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Airfloss a few weeks ago and I now enjoy flossing.</li>
            <li>The automatic 1-second feature moves the process along and no messy water or mouthwash shooting out all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The reservoir holds more than enough water for my entire mouth and I have had zero issues with the function of the product after daily use for several weeks.</li>
            <li>This holds only a bit of water which doesn&#x27;t hold much force when ejected with air between teeth along with a thump against the teeth..  </li>
            <li>For one month I used it and found it jarring and loud.</li>
            <li>have been the only one to use it (gently).  </li>
            <li>With my food allergies and regular sore gums I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to deal with that much water in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>OK, I bought this primarily to take with me when I travel because toting a giant water irrigator is rather difficult.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This does have some advantages over the old Waterpics.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline.</li>
            <li>Product failures should not happen when they are so young.</li>
            <li>which means regular floss and the sonicare is all you really need.</li>
            <li>theres no sound technology in the this like the sonicare, Unless you consider the sound of the</li>
            <li>:  Works very well and removes food particles as big as flax seeds or chunks of meat.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be at my next dental visit to see if using the air flosser results in improved gum health and decreases &#x27;pockets&#x27; below the gum line</li>
            <li>I called the dentist professional line.</li>
            <li>I completely lost my money.</li>
            <li>Green light is going on for short(few seconds) time and goes off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t always floss that frequently.</li>
            <li>In fact, until I was about 16 years old, I never flossed.</li>
            <li>I remember the electric flossers of old - what a joke.</li>
            <li>I was told by the dentist&#x27;s office that it&#x27;s really to get people who don&#x27;t regularly floss to do something.  </li>
            <li>the meantime I purchased a Waterpik flosser and though it is bulkier than the Sonic, so far it is working.</li>
            <li>I did experience on caveat on early use.  </li>
            <li>Or those who just can&#x27;t stand flossing the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>Estimate those &#x27;floss&#x27; action toothbrushes at a one and no flossing at zero</li>
            <li>and I shipped the old one to them to fix.</li>
            <li>The slightest bump and the whole unit instantly tips</li>
            <li>Flossing unit size is a bit larger than it really needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I saw they make a gadget for flossing, naturally I figured this could be the answer to my flossing</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but I am guessing she is going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>will be checking back in a month to let you know how I REALLY feel about the Airfloss.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend it, but keep your box and warranty near by!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought one for my 81 year old mother&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>the only problem is that the flosser does not hold much liquid at all, I always have to refill after each floss.  </li>
            <li>For the price it should last much longer.  </li>
            <li>The item is warranteed for two years, so I contacted Amazon and was advised to contact Philips directly.</li>
            <li>The instructions said that the water would last for the whole mouth cleaning</li>
            <li>The thing that I have not learned by daily use to overcome is the messiness of the whole operation.  </li>
            <li>They sent out a replacement unit but it was the old design - like my 3 year old one that died.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend,Like i said doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.</li>
            <li>If you check reviews and professional tests</li>
            <li>and you end up having to floss the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these through a professional trial offer,one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums at all and they seem much healthier than before with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;ve used it for a month they don&#x27;t bleed, just like you were actually flossing for real.  </li>
            <li>However, I doesn&#x27;t take much time to use and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding gums, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if any improvement on my next dental visit in three months.</li>
            <li>Works really well for the back teeth.</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to fire the plastic nozzle 5 feet through the air if it is not seated properly and snapped into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Manual bursts by pressing the button up top (at the green colored incline) for each individual burst, or putting it in 1-second burst mode, where it shoots a burst every 1 second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gotten better about it around our house over the last few years but the fact still remains that no one seems to like to floss.  </li>
            <li>i hate flossing, but this is great and works like a charm!</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND VERY LITTLE TIME.  </li>
            <li>next week, I flossed via the conventional method first to start with clean spaces between my teeth and then tried to use the Airfloss daily after that.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t slick but it isn&#x27;t really easy to hold with damp hands either.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean well and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>The sensation of mist and air blowing between my teeth was odd, but Im sure it is a personal preference of mine and not a universal feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second unit has the exact same problem.</li>
            <li>but the second might be an issue (I will try) as it is 10 days older than 1 year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is JUNK and they MUST be aware of it as I cannot be the ONLY person having multiple failures!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i think it is guaranteed for 2 years but had to send the first one back after one month, and the second one quit just over one year.</li>
            <li>The only thing which I notice that this unit has to be charge 24 hours each time, not only first time.</li>
            <li>Never thought it did much, flossed first anyway, messy.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT, also, though not too significant, Feels CHEAP compared to sonicare which is dense, heavy and seamless,  holds just enough water for your one round, it drips (no biggie), and the stand makes it wobbly.</li>
            <li>much cheaper and takes about as long.</li>
            <li>last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They pitch this to someone who doesn&#x27;t normally floss their teeth, and as a &amp;#34;30 second cleaning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t agree with the logic.</li>
            <li>So I would add this to a daily routine with normal flossing, not a substitution.  </li>
            <li>Like most people, I don’t floss nearly as much as I should, especially since I have poor gums.  </li>
            <li>Will give it full stars if the water doesn&#x27;t keep spraying messily (the part where it&#x27;s joint).</li>
            <li>(Pack of 6)]] which takes up hardly any space in the drawer and is easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, this is messier than flossing, though almost certainly more sanitary as long as you keep the tip clean.d a bit to make sure you&#x27;re not drooling it out everywhere, but it is virtually impossible to do this for all of your teeth.</li>
            <li>My Airfloss has developed a unique characteristic that might be due to my exclusive use of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second one I own, but unfortunately, the first one only worked about 2 years</li>
            <li>My main issue when using this flosser was it was just a little too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Does a better job than regular floss for those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The new unit stopped working as well, after several weeks.  </li>
            <li>But I only paid 30 (made an offer on ebay and had some ebay bucks) and it is much faster than regular flossing</li>
            <li>The light started blinking again and stopped a few seconds later.  </li>
            <li>Add to that the unit isn&#x27;t truly considered a replacement for standard flossing and there are enough reasonable caveats to give one pause.    </li>
            <li>I will try the product for some more time but it looks like it is going on the same negative direction as my sonicare toothbrush and the glosser&#x27; predecessor also by Philips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped this product might be good, but it was a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li>The split looks like it&#x27;s right down a manufacturing mold line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for the price it will last a long time and make it worth such an investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not as messy as the Water-Pic that was relegated to a shelf in my garage a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>Using this is less painful and more effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had portable water-piks in the past that were just a pain to keep clean.</li>
            <li>After just a few months the plastic casing is cracked in several places, the water chamber is gunky funky but resistant to cleaning, and the bursts of air/water are significantly weaker.  </li>
            <li>So I am not in a position of having a dead unit and can&#x27;t get a replacement for the 3rd time without providing my original receipt.  </li>
            <li>Snapping the tip at first required more force than I&#x27;d anticipated, but I&#x27;ve learned that it really must be snug to work properly, so when I remove it for cleaning, I double check to be sure it&#x27;s firmly seated in the base.  </li>
            <li>detailed instructions are hard to find.</li>
            <li>One is, that since individual blasts are sent once a second, you can position the device, and then receive the single blast of water right between your teeth.</li>
            <li>My gum disease is completely gone and the pockets are getting smaller</li>
            <li>i got this item from my orthodontist&#x27;s office, after i done with Invisalign, doctor had glued fixed retention to the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a continuous stream and I was surprised by the tiny reservoir.  </li>
            <li>i spend about 15 minutes each night cleaning my teeth with manual brush, sonicare brush, airfloss, manual floss, water pik because i have spent so much money on bridges, implants, etc and have spent too much time and pain in dentist chair since i was a child.</li>
            <li>Works relatively well but it does not feel like a complete substitute for normal&lt;br /&gt;Flossing to me.  </li>
            <li>Instead I reverted back to my old Oral B satin</li>
            <li>double cleaning action....</li>
            <li>and we were back in action within a week.</li>
            <li>but after a year it developed the same problem</li>
            <li>is kind of useless.</li>
            <li>It was an interesting idea but poorly built.  </li>
            <li>I always seem to make a mess if I try to fill the reservoir to the top in the way of it splashing out when I close the little</li>
            <li>After using the original for this long, those little differences show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thru Flossers Mint which work better and are less trouble.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik uses high pressure water to remove particles and plaque and does that very well yet has a cheap battery that dies very fast and annoying  </li>
            <li>This is a very minor issue that might be caused by my mouthwash clogging something up inside the unit that would normally prevent an air-lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was making a HUGE wet mess every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve read other reviews and apparently this flosser works well depending on how much space there is in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>My first time using it, it &#x27;hiccuped&#x27; and shot one, paused, then shot the other 2, and then when i pulled it away from my mouth it shot the 3rd shot.....almost into my eyes.</li>
            <li>We use this product very gently and are extra careful to only have water touch the reservoir.</li>
            <li>We use this product very gently and are extra careful to only have water touch the reservoir.</li>
            <li>I was having a hard time trying to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Also cleans other teeth very well.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, I was expecting a little bit more from Sonicare but this product just don&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>first one conked out after 3 months, do not waste your money total waste</li>
            <li>The main difference is that floss will help remove large bits of food (liked trapped bits of popcorn or chicken) and the documentation on this explicitly says that it is not designed to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolute, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Not real cheap but how much would u pay to keep your teeth?</li>
            <li>In a short amount of time there is a complete different in my oral health.  </li>
            <li>Using the Airfloss is easier and faster than flossing, and I immediately developed the habit of of using it daily, whereas I would blow off flossing often enough that my gums were affected.  </li>
            <li>May work well enough for some people without any gum disease although I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>My first try with the Airfloss was a little messy--TIP:</li>
            <li>The first time I called worked just a little.</li>
            <li>We purchased our first Airfloss a little over two years ago.</li>
            <li>I suppose that to keep the price down, certain sacrifices had to be made.</li>
            <li>My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  </li>
            <li>My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  </li>
            <li>Generally speaking, I still use floss, but when my gums are extra sore I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please note, as other reviewers have commented, this is not intended to replace regular flossing, but instead to supplement it for a healthier gumline and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself works very well</li>
            <li>I received this not long ago and I already have to call in to get a replacement or</li>
            <li>But, not long after we purchased it the nozzle started leaking then</li>
            <li>/&gt;This thing can get pretty messy.</li>
            <li>Although my gums didn&#x27;t bleed (as per the warning in the instructions), they did feel sore the first few times I used the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly spend less time than flossing (including twice a day now) and it&#x27;s not inconvenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a major issue but perhaps this will be fixed in a later model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset that this is breaking down like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been flossing with a variety of different devices ever since, including but not limited to all kinds of floss, dental tape, Oral-B flosser with a handle, flosser toothpicks, and the hummingbird flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made sure you press down hard and hear it snap before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third Airflosser after the first two just stopped working after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>The Airfloss doesn&#x27;t really get deep down in along the sides of the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- as the fluid gets partway used it must be held straight up and down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the large side to hold</li>
            <li>If you are just lazy and want some cool gadget that will floss for you, then either go and spend 2 million dollars and buy a robot to floss your teeth, or just spend $2 at CVS and buy some floss instead of $80 here because that $2 will go a lot further in the long run from saving you from gum disease...not to mention heart disease--&gt;[...</li>

            <li>Putting aside a couple of (possibly) minor technical faults and issues relating to the battery and charger, from a pure usage point of view there are other factors which prompted me to send mine back today for a refund.    </li>
            <li>The only thing to note is that you really do need to keep your mouth closed whilst using it (unlike one of the illustrations) as it does tend to potentially spray a long way!</li>
            <li>It takes a few squirts between certain teeth for me</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is perfect.</li>
            <li> Still, I think this Airfloss is best reserved for those people who will not EVER floss, and therefore they may get some benefit from using this.</li>

            <li> When I had the opportunity to try the Phillips Sonicare Airfloss, I thought it would be an excellent way to encourage me to “floss”.  </li>
            <li> I do think this would be an excellent tool for someone with braces.  </li>

            <li> Excellent piece of equipment to keep teeth flossed.</li>
            <li> Im happy with it!</li>
            <li> Since it is pulsing all the time, you do not need it perfectly aligned with the gap between your teeth; just move it along your teeth at the gum line.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great with mouthwash or water.</li>
            <li> concept is great but the delivery is not.  </li>

            <li> Philips was great and replaced both units.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> In the end, it&#x27;s a great idea</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great buy....</li>
            <li> have gotten great gum health reports from my dentist since using it, so even though the engineering is imperfect, I will continue to use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> Have had great dental checkups since started using this 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Great water pick.</li>
            <li> We have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for about 20 years and this is a great addition to their product line.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> GREAT</li>
            <li> It was working great</li>
            <li> Great designs</li>
            <li> great while it worked</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> We are happy</li>
            <li> A great match to our snooker tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Item is working very nice</li>
            <li> It is a very nice Dental Health Product from Philips</li>
            <li> Very good, It works really well, very happy with the product, I had very good results with it</li>
            <li> Quality of Philips&#x27; products can&#x27;t be beat, and I can honestly say the flosser is incredible.</li>
            <li> Flossing is so important to keep you teeth and gums in great shape and having the Sonicare Airflosser is perfect because it gets the job done and it feels great doing the job.</li>
            <li> Wonderful but could be better if it had 2 speeds.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may not be perfect in my dental hygienist&#x27;s eyes, but it&#x27;s a LOT better than not doing anything.  </li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> I love that I can put my own mouthwash in it!!</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect, and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and does a good job.</li>
            <li> However, Phillips has wonderful customer support and they immediately sent me a replacement which works fine.</li>
            <li> I think Philips is able to design very good products.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from the kind of terminal laziness that most of us non-flossers have, and this product has been a wonderful solution.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and performance is amazing.</li>
            <li> Once the plastic doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s airtight position, it no longer succeeds in flossing with water.</li>
            <li> (I have mostly good gums</li>
            <li> , I loved that I could use mouth wash.  </li>
            <li> Good battery one week.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dentist office is just THAT good.</li>
            <li> It blasts a good bit of mouthwash or water into your mouth.</li>
            <li> He must have gotten the one good one.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> I used it with mouthwash and the single-burst function so that I could control the pace of the bursts, and had a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> If the work they are doing a good job.</li>
            <li> it do a good at flossing?&lt;br /&gt;Yes.</li>
            <li> Is quite good.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a good idea</li>
            <li> Wonderful fit, for what I require in a product</li>
            <li> think the Airflosser would be good for someone transitioning into flossing.</li>
            <li> It is fairly shallow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is as good as using floss string.</li>
            <li> so this will be a good test.  </li>
            <li> Good product just not convinced how well it cleans</li>
            <li> good idea, but</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> For me an easier way to floss, &amp; does a good job.</li>
            <li> However, I did not feel it was a fair test of whether it will substitute for flossing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those things we know are good for you but what a chore it can be.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust this as a good alternative to flossing, but it has its place.</li>
            <li> It is good for those times you want to floss with mouth wash or just air puffs.</li>
            <li> I never remember and am not too good at it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good idea if you have weaker teeth, maybe ask your dentist before you get it.</li>
            <li> You can feel it doing good.</li>
            <li> As with others, the IDEA might be good, but the way this works is ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a good product until it</li>
            <li> It works really good once you get that.</li>
            <li> You get a good feeling after using this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my sister n law told me how good it works.  </li>
            <li> Airfloss does take out quite a fair bit of gunk and doesn&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li> awesome product which gives me floss free.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED it......</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, Philips replaced my unit twice although the warranty is just one year.</li>
            <li> good product&lt;</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product.  </li>
            <li> I had a identical Phillips Sonicare HX8211/02 from my dentist and loved it</li>
            <li> Good power and portable</li>
            <li> However, if you never floss, that doesn&#x27;t do any good.</li>
            <li> Good buy (although $10 more than buying at amazon), good cleaning tool for me and my husband!</li>
            <li> If I were dealing with braces on the front of my teeth, I have no doubt this could be an excellent way to clean the wires and</li>
            <li> could be an excellent way to clean the wires and</li>
            <li> Best tool to clean teeth with or without braces.</li>
            <li> If you have ideal spacing between teeth, the I think I could see this being more effective.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> great product and price , I love it</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t very many reviews on the site but they ALL give the product one star.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Phillip Sonicare electric flosser.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great does the job easier and better then the waterpik</li>
            <li> This is a great accessory that helps me keep my mouth and teeth very, very clean.  </li>
            <li> It is incredible, my mouth and teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> It does a great job,  makes your teeth and mouth feel extremely clean!</li>
            <li> so I love it!</li>
            <li> I have found the first option works best.  </li>
            <li> On top of that they do not mention alcohol in the manual!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and effective.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this flosser!</li>
            <li> Much better than flossing!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> , I love it!</li>
            <li> Really love this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter had perfect dental hygiene appointments for the first 11 years of her life.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to register for the warranty and make sure you read the direction!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> What in ingenious idea!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, great for travel</li>
            <li> I think the greatest benefit for me, however, has been that the simplicity has allowed me, despite my resistance to flossing, to get into a positive routine.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and very effective.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> and they said they would be happy to send me a free replacement handle.  </li>
            <li> do a great job you can filled whit you prefered mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Good, intend to buy more</li>
            <li> Nice product,</li>
            <li> Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> In fairness, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I like using mouthwash in the reservoir, but water is effective too.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> wife is as thrilled with it as I am.  </li>
            <li> Effective and easier to use than a flossing thread.</li>
            <li> I bought it on my dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and it&#x27;s every bit as handy as she said it is.</li>
            <li> How effective is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy another, but my wife really liked the product</li>
            <li> if there was some kind of warning - I could re-charge it before it gets to that</li>
            <li> Love how good my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> I had always imagined that an air or water pick would not be as effective as floss.</li>
            <li> My wife and I purchased this flosser and liked them.</li>
            <li> While I liked my flosser, I hesitate to get another one because of the problems we have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between teeth most of the time.</li>
            <li> I drained it and ran some warm water into the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it flossed, but just quit working within 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I liked the device.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for the excellent and understanding customer service.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as tradition flossing.</li>
            <li> the water pick I now own.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of the Philips Sonicare tooth brushes and liked the way they worked.  </li>
            <li> The three pronged attack is extremely effective against plaque.</li>
            <li> I used the waterpick for the longest time but since I liked the sonicare toothbrush, I thought to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I picked it up when I purchased my Philips Sonicare toothbrush and both of them together brings a very clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I found that using a bit of mouthwash in it along with water leaves a great clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Works great in getting gums clean.  </li>
            <li> This air flosser is one of the best new devices to save you a lot of money when you go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Best new product ever</li>
            <li> downside, make sure the flosshead is one secure or it will fly off.</li>
            <li> But the airfloss is a good way to floss anytime, anywhere and is even easy to carry in a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not as good as real  flossing, but this is something I&#x27;m happy to use daily--I never flossed</li>
            <li> Fortunately I wear glasses as it hits with quite a force that I don&#x27;t think would have pleasant in the eye....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great option for when there is a super contagious stomach virus going around our house</li>
            <li> Seller is good and got item very quickly.</li>
            <li> #34;any gadget that gets a patient to pay attention to interdental hygiene is better than nothing; none of them are as good as flossing; since most patients refuse to floss I recommend the gadget.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good for tooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes the teeth a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> and the kids love flossing, better yet!</li>
            <li> This unit works fine, but I wonder if it does as good a job at getting plaque off  my teeth.</li>
            <li> Frankly, this experience has lowered my opinion of Philips products which I used to think were of great quality and worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> Fun works great feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> But, the Airfloss is certainly an important step to good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh as I use it with mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than flossing - though honestly -</li>
            <li> It worked awesome for about 6 weeks, then stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I own one.</li>
            <li> Great and fun way to floss.</li>
            <li> All in all, gargling with water was more effective at getting the stuff out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The most honest seem to say &amp;</li>
            <li> As far as the results went, nothing impressive for that amount of money.</li>
            <li> I can easily find the spaces between my teeth!</li>
            <li> The Philips Airfloss Electric Flosser has a good amount of power to blast through and clean under the gumline.</li>
            <li> Airfloss, I loved the feeling of truly clean healed gums I was experiencing flossing with water.</li>
            <li> great product -- does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too..</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did make my gums bleed but after that it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well run and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and understand, and effective.</li>
            <li> The Philips Flosser is quick and easy to use and is very effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, reasonable price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very important that we keep our gums healthy or we will lose teeth and</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great flossing system that is easy on the gums and does a great job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> and I love it,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased this after a dental visit, I love this item.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was more reliable.</li>
            <li> I love the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S</li>
            <li> I use either water or a combination of water and mouthwash to get between each and every tooth in my mouth, focusing on the areas where I have gold crowns that trap more food than I can believe.  </li>
            <li> I love this airflosser.</li>
            <li> Colored floss helps you see plaque build-up much better than floss</li>
            <li> Works perfect and we&#x27;ll likely purchase another.</li>
            <li> Would be even better if there were a way to adjust the water pressure.  </li>
            <li> I will make sure my orthodontist does not recommend this product again.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips Sonicare flosser at Costco and was expecting something more like a water jet.</li>
            <li> It needs to be able to hold more mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I was mostly incorrect about that.  </li>
            <li> This product creates a &#x27;mist&#x27; of mostly air and some water/mouthwash that puffs between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Took many, many phone calls to get a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> if more than one person in your household will be using it.  </li>
            <li> more closely, it seems that it is glued together&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips is not a name for quality any more.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting concept that is not yet fully optimized.  </li>
            <li> The children love it and do it</li>
            <li> works even better than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I was able to floss everything in one go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> but, three stars for being better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> One more item to decorate your bathroom.</li>
            <li> make sure</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts more than a week after each charge.</li>
            <li> My mouth smelled so much better, it felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that I use it more times a day.</li>
            <li> This is a innovative idea in some sorts.</li>
            <li> I would suggest sticking with a good electric toothbrush like Philips Sonicare brand, but using the good old manual flossing.</li>
            <li> even more so because someone mentioned that they felt like &#x27;they just walked out the dentist office after a cleaning&#x27; after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item, it does all that the summary says it will do, I have recommended to friends</li>
            <li> This glossed is better than hand flossing any day.</li>
            <li> But as I reside in Mexico and I bought this on a trip to USA, the cost of shipping would be more than the value of the product.  </li>
            <li> Has motivated me to do a better job brushing too.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love this.</li>
            <li> If you want to test it, be sure to spit out the water it uses rather than swallow</li>
            <li> Much better than trying to floss with braces</li>
            <li> But for our kids, this is much better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of freshness afterwards, and I felt that it did a much better job than just brushing or even manual flossing.</li>
            <li> I have their cordless toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found that this item cleans the teeth just like flossing.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can load with mouthwash for even better results.</li>
            <li> The flosser does not work any more as the fluid/air leak at the joint of the flosser head and the replaceable tip.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting with this product, dentist recommending this to my wife.</li>
            <li> Thought I would be getting more for the money, or maybe I am using it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Love my Philips Sonicare Airfloss.  </li>
            <li> I also LOVE that you can fill the reservoir with water or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I regret that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> but it does a better job than anything else i have tried</li>
            <li> They also told him there was nothing more they could do for me.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it&#x27;s correct.</li>
            <li> Perfect for starting off the day.</li>
            <li> see that they sell replacement heads, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to have to replace them more often than recommended because the instructions say to rinse out after every use...</li>
            <li> maybe i am not using it correctly, pressing the button too many times, or battery</li>
            <li> Expect more of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve read about to keep healthy gums.</li>
            <li> This is ok</li>
            <li> We were already using Sonicare toothbrushes (and love them), so my husband agreed to give it</li>
            <li> Your dentists have better equipment and this is not even 2nd best.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 more for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> Cleans and removes better than any dental floss.</li>
            <li> I love Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I find it encourages me to use the mouth wash more often since I can use mouth wash to floss my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll find out if my Dentist agrees in about 3 more months, but he is the one who recommended it</li>
            <li> I am not in love with how it feels when it squirts between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way that feels either, but I feel that I am getting a better cleaning with the floss rather than the water sports.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats dragging the floss between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> , flossing is better.</li>
            <li> Even after flossing, when I use the Airfloss, it finds more food particles.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> My dental appointments have been a lot better :)</li>
            <li> Needs more pressure</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product it works magic on my mouth.</li>
            <li> Never had better check ups....</li>
            <li> My gums never felt so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this this device....</li>
            <li> can use your favorite mouth wash .</li>
            <li> I love, I have braces</li>
            <li> battery does not hold a charge more than 1 1/2 uses unless I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;re always looking for ways to make flossing easier and more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I feel a bit underwhelmed since I was hoping the effectiveness would be more on par with floss</li>
            <li> I have never found a better flosser.  </li>
            <li> But the Philips Sonicare flosser in conjunction with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is better than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Could not ask for better service.</li>
            <li> Outlets are at a premium in most bathrooms</li>
            <li> Love this water pik, it works well with my teeth implants.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be better, but after using it, I find that it just doesn&#x27;t get the job</li>
            <li> DO like it better than a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; which I have two</li>
            <li> Units works OK.  </li>
            <li> I threw out the box assuming it would be much much better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I would avoid these - or make sure you save your receipt.  </li>
            <li> am so relieved to have something I can use more than once a day along with brushing with an electric toothbrush to help with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast service and a great product.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I would&#x27;ve found this years ago.</li>
            <li> Flossing does much better.  </li>
            <li> My oral hygienist and my orthodontist&#x27;s office always compliment me on my healthy gums and oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> and we both love this.</li>
            <li> Better than floss and gets food out that nothing else can.</li>
            <li> I also was pleased with this product, however, agree the pressure shooting into my bridge was like a &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> As others have commented, it would be better if it held more liquid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really enjoyed using the product while it was working.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness-</li>
            <li> I was able to use mine around 10x&#x27;s before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel much better.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK</li>
            <li> , I use the water pik which I love and this which was recommended by my dentist .</li>
            <li> Perhaps with time it will be better  </li>
            <li> pleased Phillips electric toothbrush user.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best device of its type on the market, but Philips obviously has manufacturing problems.  </li>
            <li> I love air flossing so much better then floss....</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommend this, claimed it was better than water flossed.  </li>
            <li> I love this electric flosser.  </li>
            <li> and you would probably be better off just hitting the button yourself.</li>
            <li> Love it-</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with this one.</li>
            <li> The product is just OK.</li>
            <li> also their electric toothbrush are the duo that I need for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Love them until they died within 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Love the  sonic care Flosser.</li>
            <li> Flossing would probably be more through but using this in my opinion is much better than doing nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but  I was always able to get a replacement of these non-working units.  </li>
            <li> These units are not user repairable with too many failures.  </li>
            <li> I make sure that I fill it with mouthwash that has no alcohol in it -</li>
            <li> I knew I had to floss to keep my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> three years, my checkups have been better.</li>
            <li> This device got me to take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I use mouthwash and works great for fresh breath and clean mouth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very powerful!</li>
            <li> Nice addition to ability to clean around gumline.  </li>
            <li> works good, but does not hold very much water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great unit, and as long as its used in ADDITION to flossing, you will notice how clean and great it makes your mouth feel after every use.</li>
            <li> , very clean teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Together, your dental hygiene will be improved and your digestion will also thank you for keeping the first step of that process in good condition.</li>
            <li> Pretty darned good</li>
            <li> guess if you have pretty good flossing skills, you can skip this and do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good, cleans your teeth very well and makes you feel fresh, as if you just have some dental cleaning by the professionals.</li>
            <li> The new one worked great for about 5 uses and the switch once again became unresponsive.  </li>
            <li> The air floss electric flosser is easy to handle and a refreshing experience each day to maintain ones dental needs.</li>
            <li> I am, pleased with this product so easy to use.</li>
            <li> &amp; air blast are strong, i sometimes wonder whether the blast grind off my teeth after many years of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easy to use  and love the chamber you can fill with mouthwash or water based on preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it so many chances because when it works, I really like what a good job it does.</li>
            <li> After using it, I can see food particles that flossing missed, and it also leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean!  </li>
            <li> It works great and really does clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect especially if you want a fresh mouth and have healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Fantastic help for healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I got it replaced here through Amazon, and everything so far has been great...</li>
            <li> Not as powerful and effective as I was hoping it would be.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take that much, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I fell it does not do as good a job as the water pick, but is much  easier to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy &amp; quick to use.</li>
            <li> This Airfloss makes it very easy and quick</li>
            <li> Just loved the Philips Sonicare Airfloss, makes your teeth feel so much cleaner , so easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy in that it is not connected to a huge water tank, but you run out of water fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I called them again and they will not replace it because the original unit was purchased more than 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what all the complaining was about from some customers, but it is easy to use, and it does not &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; all over the place like some claimed.  </li>
            <li> Start gums bleed easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; Uber efficient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is easy to assemble-</li>
            <li> love the Airfloss because it doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore to do and the kids love having fun doing this without knowing all the benefits they are receiving.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss did a better job of keeping my teeth clean via this method, but after about 9 or 10 days, I still had to pull out the dental floss again and get the plaque out between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to knock over if you leave it standing on a countertop with or without the charger.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I will buy one for my office and one for the car since the one I have lives in the living room at home.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy and not as time consuming as using the floss thread.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and everyone in my family loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use (point the tip to the gaps between your teeth and push the button)</li>
            <li> It is so easy.</li>
            <li> , it is built well, sturdy, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t do that the tip flies out of the device.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic cover for water detaches from device too easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the flosser is easy.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So easy to floss and using the mouth wash</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and take care of.</li>
            <li> and I got great reviews at my most recent check-up.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews that you can easily break this.</li>
            <li> though I liked it very much I found the design bulky.  </li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but it tips over easily when placed on the charger.</li>
            <li> Okay, that part is true.  </li>
            <li> My long years of night time teeth grinding has caused a lot of enamel loss as well as gum recession so this flosser wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.  </li>
            <li> My long years of night time teeth grinding has caused a lot of enamel loss as well as gum recession so this flosser wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.  </li>
            <li> For an oral irrigation device, this is a pretty nice alternative for people that don&#x27;t like flossing.  </li>
            <li> If the mouthwash is less strong than a Listerine, then you can use just mouthwash and it works and feels great!  </li>
            <li> Broke down (wouldn&#x27;t charge) once, but the Philips after sales service impressed me.</li>
            <li> Waterpik hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t practice good dental hygiene practice as a kid, so I got this as somewhat of a new year&#x27;s resolution to improve the state of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked fine for 2 months</li>
            <li> Should be fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, extremely easy to use although it took quite a bit of pressure to connect the head to the handle unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my dentist will be pleased as well.</li>
            <li> it works fine for four months, then fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They told him it&#x27;s in the fine print within the instructions.</li>
            <li> The dentist was impressed with the improvement and there was much less bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fine while it lasted.</li>
            <li> The first unit had an issue with retaining a charge, however, second one works perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these almost two years ago and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li> The one I wound up with is fine</li>
            <li> Seems to do a fine job of cleaning</li>
            <li> Once the fine print was available.to read.regarding the.operation..</li>
            <li> Price was fine.</li>
            <li> I have all crowns, an this product is super!  </li>
            <li> I still floss with tape, but this is a good quick floss when I can&#x27;t go the whole tape route; at night I even do both...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about this air flosser is even though it does use water, or even mouth wash, it does not use large amounts.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Sleek and comfortable in the hand and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Great additional dental care (along with Sonicare brush and regular dental floss).  </li>
            <li> This device is not intended to take the place of your flossing, it&#x27;s a tool to stimulate the gums using water and force, forcing particles free of the teeth trap.  </li>
            <li> the part that held the mouth wash or water, flew off and cannot be found, it did this before, and i found it, but could not get it securely in place</li>
            <li> But as a suppliment to daily flossing this unit works great.  </li>
            <li> For people with bridgework, I would think a tool like this would be indispensable.  </li>
            <li> The power indicator light does not flash indicating either that the unit is charging or fully charged.</li>
            <li> Would make a great Christmas present!</li>
            <li> I just wished it would work, because it is very convenient and effective.  </li>
            <li> I have had my regular check-ups and cleanings and my gums are in great condition and no bleeding, so it is working quite well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used water flossers before, and my primary gripe about them is the water tank.</li>
            <li> The height and weight are important, in that I struggle each morning to activate the flosser.  </li>
            <li> and you really feel how effective it is</li>
            <li> Airfloss, which A (again), SONIC means sound and B</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I decided to allow it to stay connected and initiated a Chat session with Phillips Sonicare Customer Service after 12 hours with the charge light still not working.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare Airfloss is nicer than flossing manually, and it&#x27;s more powerful than a Hummingbird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this primarily with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s much more fun when it comes to flossing.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, with a dash of mouth wash in the appliance, I enjoy this method of &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; each night before bed.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is more fun</li>
            <li> or so is still cheap to save my gums, but then again I wasn&#x27;t planning on this being a subscription plan.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my unit but the charging/ power light</li>
            <li> This air floss is worth every penny, it cleans between teeth so much better and softer than any string floss.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare brushes are such a joy to use so</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel entirely comfortable putting my fingers in my mouth to floss lest I get the virus in my system.</li>
            <li> I then use the Philips Flosser filled with ACT mouthwash.</li>
            <li> but I am unconvinced a 3rd replacement will make me happy.</li>
            <li> After using it nightly for 6 months, my gums were greatly improved at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Sonicare replaced that one free of charge,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Now I think it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap.......</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Has worked great for me for several months.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find any noticeable improvement over using just the Phillips Easy Clean Tooth Brush.</li>
            <li> Pressing the trigger just produces a buzzing sound but no results.  </li>
            <li> Worked for a month or so and was securely packed away during a move and once unpacked it never worked again.</li>
            <li> It makes a sound when the button is pushed but no water or even air comes out.</li>
            <li> type cleaner far superior</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter tool - since it leaves the person experiencing the cleaner mouth, maybe it will lead to good hygiene and flossing technique with a regular, manual string, much like what the Hummingbird did for me years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought extra heads so the whole family can take advantage of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that real flossing is better for your teeth and gums, but for someone like me who has never been in the habit of flossing, this is much better than doing nothing besides brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband to help with sensitive gums at the recommendation of our dentist, and we both have loved it.  </li>
            <li> When the water truly shooting out, it hits my palm pretty strongly!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and something that doesn&#x27;t take long but gives great results.  </li>
            <li> But her teeth have been spotless for the first time in ages!!  </li>
            <li> So much easier than floss!!!</li>
            <li> I have made the use of this flosser part of my everyday evening routine and my gums look wonderful (they did do some bleeding at first but most of that has stopped with continued use).</li>
            <li> I have not missed a day using since I purchased it because it is so easy and quick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quick and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> quick and easy</li>
            <li> Is a quick, easy way ro floss.</li>
            <li> This is so quick and easy, and I&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> After meals, a quick &amp;#34;go-around&amp;#34; with this flosser really works nice.  </li>
            <li> Love it, combined with my sonicare it makes your mouth feel &amp;#34;dentist office clean&amp;#34; easy to use very portable.</li>
            <li> This was great for 6 weeks, that&#x27;s how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> and there was still significant Plaque.</li>
            <li> I looked at one of at Target and then Bed Bath etc and the price was $90 plus tax, so Amazon&#x27;s  price of $60 was a significant discount.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I like that you can target between the teeth and make sure the mouthwash really gets in there!</li>
            <li> This is an update of my original review.</li>
            <li> My original unit stopped working after 10-12 weeks.</li>
            <li> The woman I talked to told me that even though I had registered the product they would need my original receipt to honor the warrantee at this time.</li>
            <li> I was at work and had originally registered the product, so I requested they review my registration.</li>
            <li> Love it when i first got it.</li>
            <li> If hard to floss with own hands, Philips Sonicare is a great substitute.</li>
            <li> However, I know that it&#x27;s important for gum/tooth health, and so I was SUPER excited to see this air floss option.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely clean between teeth.</li>
            <li> Lets be honest most people dont floss daily.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean around my implants, which I have two.</li>
            <li> My dentist said that traditional floss is much more effective and discouraged me from switching to the air flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought the Airfloss in Jan 2014 and my teeth have never felt as clean as they do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Honestly, my teeth feel more refreshed after using regular floss to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend buying additional floss heads if you do purchase it - found them super cheap at amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling minty clean.</li>
            <li> However, my teeth do feel well clean and gums feel clean, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It also works well to clean around things like crowns, implants, veneers, etc.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth is so clean feeling if you use mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Product recommended to me by my dentist&#x27;s office to clean gum area around dental implants.</li>
            <li> - so my mouth doesn&#x27;t get clean that night -</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the power to clean properly&lt;br /&gt;between</li>
            <li> The great battery life has made it very convenient to take along for frequent business travel, even overseas.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> This is really easy to use and gives my mouth a fresh feel.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t clean between my tooth and this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy for me to clean and keep my mouth fresh within 1 min</li>
            <li> /&gt;My nighttime tooth cleaning routine now leaves my teeth very nearly as clean as when I see the dentist.</li>
            <li> If you leave water in this device or if you don&#x27;t clean the head after every use you invalidate the warranty.</li>
            <li> Nothing has changed and I&#x27;m still complimented on how clean I keep my teeth and braces.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing to clean off that had been caught under the wire.  </li>
            <li> For that kind of money, it better last a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I like it because I can take it anywhere in the house and not be chained to the sink to clean in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The spaces between my teeth were never so clean.</li>
            <li> Air floss bursts are quick and powerful removing most leftover food quickly from between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Sure, you might say I should have just bucked up and been responsible about flossing in the first place, and that&#x27;s true, but this product has been more pleasant and significantly easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and has made me a daily flosser.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not positive that it&#x27;s just as effective as flossing, but over a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Good machine, well designed, and works great, but too much jolting pressure against sensitive areas in the mouth with extensive dental work.  </li>
            <li> - in just 2 weeks I have experienced great improvement in my gums - had a couple of spots that were previously inflamed and the dentist told me to give extra attention to these areas.  </li>
            <li> nothing really special.</li>
            <li> fill this flosser with my special mouth rinse and go to town on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have to give special mention to Amazon, who replaced ours even though it was a bit over the return window.</li>
            <li> My son had brought his AirFloss for me to try, as I have special needs when trying to care for my teeth.</li>
            <li> So then I push the head right in between teeth and push the button, a lot of things came out, yay!</li>
            <li> so I knew it was working right!  </li>
            <li> Use it every day and it seems to do a good enough job at keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> otherwise, seems to being a very good job of cleaning in between the teeth-it isn&#x27;t as harsh as flossing and does not make your gums bleed like poking around with floss or brush pick</li>
            <li> I called Phillips who at first said just to clean it!  </li>
            <li> This funny gadget is easy to use and makes it almost fun to floss!  </li>
            <li> First, if you have closely spaced teeth, the device doesn&#x27;t seem to be as capable or effective cleaning between them.    </li>
            <li> Works pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> I bought the first at my dentist&#x27;s office and liked it so much that I used it after every meal since I work at home.  </li>
            <li> not that sure how much the mist cleans.</li>
            <li> My mouth didn&#x27;t feel super clean after using this.</li>
            <li> Cool Mint Flavor Floss 40 M</li>
            <li> Phillips is true to its brand</li>
            <li> I filled up the reservoir with mouthwash, and try to put the spout in between teeth and this flosser squirts out with force the mouthwash, and my mouth does feel fresh and renovated.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and thought it did a good job - but it only lasted TWO WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist but the product does not even do as good a job as simply rinsing one&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li> Good for your gums and basic oral wellnesd.</li>
            <li> Cool Mint Mouthwash x 500ml]].</li>
            <li> This air floss seems like a good idea however, you need regular flossing</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> SWEET.</li>
            <li> Good product, but only issue is that it can&#x27;t replace the battery....</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as good as an actual string floss.</li>
            <li> Once you become accustomed to the quick bursts you can feel an improved clean feeling after each use.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good complement to my regular dental hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> The whole process reminds me a lot of the Waterpik I used many years ago when I had braces.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> For better plaque and debris removal just get a real oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> Every day my mouth is full of blood.</li>
            <li> Shape pretty easy to use and quick to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this Airfloss after first checking out the other electronic flossing devices (water based ones), and decided this one seemed to fit my needs best considering there isnt much involved to get this thing going (no connecting to water lines or filling tanks with water).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many people complain about how this is not as good as using string floss, and I would agree that if you have a particle of food stuck between your teeth above the gum line, using regular floss to remove it might be a better solution, but this product is absolutely perfect for me and has made a huge difference already, despite having only been used for a short time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I floss daily because it makes my teeth and gums feel healthy, but this flosser is a good second line of defense to make sure I get all the areas between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The quality of this unit is not what I have experienced from other Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> Works good but could use a little more horse power.</li>
            <li> I can floss my teeth just as quickly as it takes to get between all the teeth with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick but not as thorough as a water pik.</li>
            <li> I used the quick start guide which said use water or mouthwash, nothing about alcohol.</li>
            <li> I asked why they have a Quick Start guide if you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it.</li>
            <li> All they had to do was make a note in the Quick Start guide about non alcohol.</li>
            <li> In my review I objected to the fact that Canadians can use the Philips USA support site, but south of the border, we are not so lucky.  </li>
            <li> This flosser is super.  </li>
            <li> Inside the blister pack you will find the device, its AC charging dock, and paperwork (quick start guide, longer guide, registration).</li>
            <li> So many reviews were bad--mostly claiming that the pressure is too low and flossing or the Waterpick are better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this can be a useful part of your dental care, but I&#x27;m going to stick with the good &#x27;ole fashioned flossing for the time being.</li>
            <li> so this is a painless and quick alternative for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows the importance of flossing but most dentists will tell you most people don&#x27;t do enough of it.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I was wearing my glasses or else</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;works&#x27; between some of my back teeth, but my front teeth both top and bottom are more crowded, and this stops Airfloss in its tracks.</li>
            <li> Now that my gums are better conditioned, the pressure doesn&#x27;t feel as high, but I know it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to whom want to have healthier mouth and better teeth</li>
            <li> Philips Airfloss is more of a tool for those with dental work preventing normal flossing.  </li>
            <li> Use it ,its very much!</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased with how the AirFloss works, and look forward to what my dental hygienist thinks when I go next time.</li>
            <li> The sensation is not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing a much better job of flossing than I do, even though I use regular floss right before I use this.</li>
            <li> I am thankful Sonicare offers an easily used unit!</li>
            <li> ON A SCALE 1-10 the product rate as a 10, highly recommend, overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best floss more convenient, the only bad side about it was I used to own one but after using it for more than 3 months it just broke</li>
            <li> male, and loved the first Sonicare I had.  </li>
            <li> This Electric Flosser really does the job so easily</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product which does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> The best , just 30 seconds to do the whole mouth, much much easier that regular flossing, better results than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much time &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li> sent all back for replacements from Sonicare, one more try!</li>
            <li> It is Exactly what I wanted,, and got it a lot cheaper from here !  </li>
            <li> Will send it back and hope to get a better one!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Totally changed my habit and I love floss now!</li>
            <li> It doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do</li>
            <li> doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do</li>
            <li> For me, while I absolutely love my recently acquired Sonicare \\&quot;Easy Clean\\&quot; toothbrush, the \\&quot;airfloss\\&quot; was not the solution I was searching for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you are like me and get four cleanings a year from your dentist and LOVE having a clean mouth, floss every day and want that EXTRA clean feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you are like me and get four cleanings a year from your dentist and LOVE having a clean mouth, floss every day and want that EXTRA clean feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it goes long term - but so far so good!</li>
            <li> but I enjoy using it and certainly have cleaner teeth.  </li>
            <li> works fine, but I think it should hold a bit more fluid than it does.</li>
            <li> Not painful and very much like a gum massage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s more effective than using floss, but you can use with mouthwash and leaves you with a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> thought the Philips will have the same idea but with lithium power and the amazing sonicare charging cradle which i can use for both my sonicare tooth brush and the</li>
            <li> enjoy using it - enough fluid in dispenser for one thorough cleanse great, with a bit of mouth wash leaves mouth feeling ggod</li>
            <li> absolutely should become comfortable with positioning the tool, so as not to shoot downward and harm your gum</li>
            <li> &quot; I expect it to replace traditional flossing as an equally effective way of flossing your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> This is far more fun.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful handheld electronic device.</li>
            <li> Though the idea may sound interesting, flossing regularly and using a sonicare, to me, Does the job between the gums, though I still use a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> It may not be 100% as effective as flossing, but compared to 0% flossing, this is a definite improvement for my dental health.</li>
            <li> Fun to squirt at wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but your mouth will feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> Really powerful.</li>
            <li> worth the money</li>
            <li> and I think this product is worth the price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever purchasing anything else from this company even if the product ultimately proves acceptable.  </li>

            <li> husband has also had success with the Airfloss.  </li>
            <li> Took a bit of time to get it but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Quite powerful and long-lasting charge.</li>
            <li> They are very happy with how it cleans as expected and use it daily after tooth brishing with the Diamond Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss uses the same charger that my Sonicare toothbrush uses so that is handy.</li>
            <li> door.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a month I can say it is worth using.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist had me purchase one for her, as my gums and teeth have never looked better, and I&#x27;m 70 years old, with no</li>
            <li> but if you have problems with floss it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really powerful, so</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quite a powerful blast.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t charge well and is now useful.</li>
            <li> It claims to have 2 uses or 2 days worth (I forget)</li>
            <li> it is it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle at over $100</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also messy, lots of water everywhere, although being able to use mouthwash in the reservoir was nice.</li>
            <li> so much more comfortable than regular flossing!</li>
            <li> My dentist heard about this product and said it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> Not so good as expected.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning in between teeth provided that you don&#x27;t have too much cap work; otherwise, the product isn&#x27;t going to match the cleaning power of a regular flossing.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product, as electric toothbrushes have been around for a while, but an electric flosser is pretty new.</li>
            <li> dental technology becomes more practical and portable in the home, I&#x27;m always interested in new products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result was a very fresh mouth, much like one had gargled with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest version of the Airfloss is slightly different from the original.</li>
            <li> one would hope they would not fail so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have been very serious about my oral health for many years and this product is great.  </li>
            <li> It is apparent this unit won&#x27;t last more than 10 months to don&#x27;t buy it, it is a rip off and will cost you just under $10 a month to own.</li>
            <li> I feel like I flossed for the very first time when I first used this.</li>
            <li> Love it really gets between the teeth highly recommend</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t right to do to us consumers.</li>
            <li> you turn the power on, and then put the Airfloss in between your teeth right at the gum.  </li>
            <li> You push the trigger button and it pushes the air right in.  </li>
            <li> it would have hit me right in the eye!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> With nerve damage to my right arm, and neuropathy in both hands, the waterpik</li>
            <li> Love it, teeth and gums feel amazing everyday!</li>
            <li> Still feel as though I need to really floss to acheive a truly clean effect.  </li>
            <li> This works so fast that you could easily use it 2-3 times a day just before brushing and could add more \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; to your daily routine in this way.</li>
            <li> whole my mouth feel really clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much gentler way to clean between teeth</li>
            <li> This really helps with getting my teeth fully clean.  </li>
            <li> Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser really seems to floss you teeth &#x27;dental hygienist&#x27; clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the process takes much longer than 30 seconds, based on operation, technique, repeating and clean</li>
            <li> but alas it seems either more experience using the device will make one more adept or perhaps it&#x27;s more of a supplement to brushing and flossing regularly.  </li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth I use the flosser and it really cleans between the teeth and makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Have to stand over the sink, and makes such a mess, but they are great for healthy gum tissue.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty neat since you can place your favorite mouthwash in it and blast the plaque between your teeth; that said, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s effective enough or even quick enough to replace flossing.</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and had high hopes for this, but it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I used it with TheraBreath Professional Oral rinse and my mouth feels really clean as well!</li>
            <li> Works great but the reservoir cover broke after a few uses!</li>
            <li> My hygienist reports that the pocket has gone from 5 to 4 mm, and my gums look better in general.  </li>
            <li> So, this is messier than flossing, though almost certainly more sanitary as long as you keep the tip clean.</li>
            <li> A piece of food that is stuck in the gum, such a skin from an apple didn&#x27;t pop right out, this seems to be more useful for plaque between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is effective, but compared to the WaterPik I am used to using it is slow and ineffecient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing kinda Spits a powerful infectious blast in between, But I honestly only felt it at the top.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of these people, there is a good chance that the Sonicare is going to do more for your oral hygiene than a cursory or poor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s easy to use and</li>
            <li> : Well it&#x27;s been around a year and a half of consistently good cleanings.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to anyone who has braces and has problems getting their teeth clean with a brush and waterpik.</li>
            <li> I was actually in the market for a Waterpick when I decided this would be a lot more convenient, and I think I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li> Pretty strong force but works as expected and gets my teeth, in between, clean!</li>
            <li> That is very fortunate since I am on my second air flosser.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t feel that it completely replaces floss, but it does such a good job of cleaning that I feel safe just using this as a substitute for a couple days at a time.  </li>
            <li> think if a company really wants to sell a product they shouldn&#x27;t really use the name of their better products to affiliated a new line, even though its in the Oral Care category, There is nothing &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; about it.</li>
            <li> It would probably be fine for others but not for my sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> It just provides a quick spritz of water mist, no where near enough to be effective @</li>
            <li> B00488A9VU DenTek Complete Clean Floss Picks, Fresh Mint 75 ea]]</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and is very easy to use but not better than actually flossing.  </li>
            <li> It works if you are consistent.</li>
            <li> Bought this first for myself and husband...then bought them as gifts for children.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> My first time using this Airfloss</li>
            <li> but I wish the water reservoir held more water so that I do not have to keep filling up in the middle of using the product.</li>
            <li> I received it as promised and it work exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> The Airflosser works very well and is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, you WILL spray the bathroom mirror by accident.</li>
            <li> I love this product,but my first one only workeD for 3 years.</li>
            <li> It runs out of water before I&#x27;m able to cover the front and the back of all my teeth.</li>
            <li> It may take more than 30 seconds to use this device on your entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I accidentally dropped the first and broke it after 2 years).</li>
            <li> Love this as an alternative to regular flossing!</li>
            <li> When I first received my Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li> So they sold me this airfloss afterwards and told me &amp;#34;brush first with toothpaste, then use it.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It seems to work as advertised, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell what real good it does.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was dedicated, I used it once to twice a day</li>
            <li> I got my first one through my dentist, I followed all the instructions, and I did not use it as a throwing toy or baseball bat in any way.  </li>
            <li> I had to dunk it in water, because the battery was getting so hot</li>
            <li> first bought a Sonicare Elite in 2005, and my teeth had never felt cleaner in my life.  </li>
            <li> It is one more thing to keep plugged in on your bathroom countertop, and I really do not see the true benefit of the device.</li>
            <li> unlike the first model.  </li>
            <li> being said, I can tell you this thing definitely does not feel as refreshing as when I walk out of my dentist office.</li>
            <li> But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.t</li>
            <li> But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li> ok, So, my aunt actually bought me this thing.</li>
            <li> In the first case, the battery died within 6 months.  </li>
            <li> that will help them develop a better way to fill the chamber and an appreciation for a larger chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Philips did replace my first</li>
            <li> After the initial 24 hours charing, the battery was able to last for more than 1 week, on one use per day basis.</li>
            <li> I tried it by flossing with my Glide floss first.  </li>
            <li> What a piece of crab for so much money!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not only refreshing, but</li>
            <li> When I first used this,I thought it was garbage.  </li>
            <li> It did and I don&#x27;t have to have the planing and scaling--not only saving me hundreds of dollars, but giving me an easier way to maintain healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> used water first, then switched to mouthwash as the product suggests.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would come with several floss tips so that more than one person could use it.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to charge it for 24 hours for the first time</li>
            <li> (the first charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> works real well and makes you want to floss every day!</li>
            <li> but sometimes it won&#x27;t work when I first turned it on and after hold the button for a moment while its still on the charger for it to stay on after I remove it.</li>
            <li> I like the Airfloss so much better than traditional floss...</li>
            <li> it starts charging... very convenient!  </li>
            <li> However, the first airfloss stopped working after about a month.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much I am having fun using this</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love this, but still need to use in conjunction with traditional flossing</li>
            <li> The first week or two it made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> If the pressure was higher, I would not use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I had my first cleaning since buying it.</li>
            <li> Overall I was impressed with the Power Flosser which I will be using on a twice daily basis in future.</li>
            <li> For example, a tooth pick form a Chinese resteraunt is better than this product.</li>
            <li> I can use this flosser instead and feel it&#x27;s more likely that I won&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> Flossing has never been so much easier !</li>
            <li> And with the mouthwash, it keeps my breath feeling fresh for much longer than just brushing.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my family, it cleans pretty well</li>
            <li> But today was the first time I have used it.</li>
            <li> It gushes a lot more fluid than the Airfloss so using mouthwash is not practical.</li>
            <li> think this does a better job when you have a tiny bit of space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I used my first one 2 years and then it would not recharge</li>
            <li> She is aware of my many physical limitations and has tried to find ways to help me.</li>
            <li> Many dentists recommend it because of the Sonicare name; definitely hasn&#x27;t lived up to that name.</li>
            <li> At first water just splashed  all over me when I used it.  </li>
            <li> the first two days she jumped every time she set off the jet</li>
            <li> I have returned mine and ordered a different brand with more options.</li>
            <li> First the flap holding the mouthwash broke off, only partially able to return to functioning.  </li>
            <li> (I recommend reading the directions first rather than just trying it)</li>
            <li> Gets more out between the teeth than regular floss.</li>
            <li> With the correct technique it is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li> Evidently I have not learned to keep all the media inside my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Water Pik is ten times better.</li>
            <li> Whenever I tried to use the standard water irrigator, I would gag and choke most every time.  </li>
            <li> I have minimized this by make sure to close my lips as much as possible but it can still spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found the price to be better that the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for the same reason most others seem to have bought it:</li>
            <li> It does an OK job with the &#x27;surface&#x27; cleaning but does not work at all for the deep cleaning (I still need to use floss).</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li> The first one died because I was using mouthwash instead of water in it...</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The problem from the first one was a crack on the body I got after accidental drop from the sink three times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but after that it&#x27;s easy and so much better that string.</li>
            <li> High quality, Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.  </li>
            <li> She was right; this is so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I made sure that I was giving the Airfloss a fair chance by being very careful and going over every space two or three times until the reservoir was empty and still got debris with the Water-pic.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the money to know that I am helping my cause of trying to keep as many of my teeth as possible when I get older.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, it has pushed me back into traditional flossing on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work okay with all of them, but it&#x27;s hard to know for sure without some pretty close dental examination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain the 2nd generation will be even better.  </li>
            <li> I have used about 2 sonicare electric toothbrushes in the last ten years, absolutely worth the investment, worth every single penny, and the latest versions DO actually clean better than older versions!</li>
            <li> To clean your teeth with it, you have to put the tip at the gum line between the teeth and keep moving it to direct spray between the teeth.</li>
            <li> A solid enhancement to a regular program of good dental care.  </li>
            <li> When you push the button on top the nozzle will blow out a strong puff of air, along with a small jet of water or mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten positive remarks from my dentist.</li>
            <li> It has been a positive experience.</li>
            <li> so I expect a positive review of my oral health.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth did not feel clean after using it (other than the fresh clean of the mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son puts a little water or mouthwash in it and is able to clean in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> First try, it did hurt, but I was jamming it in between my teeth too much.</li>
            <li> I got my first oral-B Hummingbird Flosser (since discontinued), which truly taught me to appreciate how much cleaner my gums felt after flossing.</li>
            <li> When I first used this cleaner it did not feel as it was doing much.</li>
            <li> And the reservoir is way too small -- it is good for about two uses before it has to be refilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I have dropped off how much I use traditional floss, but the current routine seems to get me good reviews every time I see the hygienist.</li>
            <li> This product is good if you&#x27;re too lazy to floss.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean and my mouth so fresh since I have been using it for the last 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li> Air flossing mechanism is very strong and definitely not for use by those with sensitive teeth or gums even though it says it&#x27;s gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality of floss with this machine is not probably on par with traditional flossers, but this is very fast and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> This new one is working fine so far.  </li>
            <li> Less effective than water floss.</li>
            <li> The blister pack is easy to open without tools by separating the two interlocking parts.</li>
            <li> A quick google search will render a class action suit for this product.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are pricey, but do seem to last a good long while.  </li>
            <li> reservoir is more than half used up in a single treatment; effectively you must refill it each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just certain areas have always bled)</li>
            <li> Perhaps I implied that there was a design flaw in the product - I certainly believe it, so maybe it came across in my review</li>
            <li> Just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t being fooled</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and the flosser really is too powerful and makes my gums bleed and hurt.</li>
            <li> I t was working fine until July 2nd when battery died and I place flosser on charger.</li>
            <li> This is the main reason I&#x27;m not rating it higher.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t replace manual flossing altogether, but it certainly makes it much, much easier</li>
            <li> Put warm water and a little Listerine in there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve manually flossed after use of the Airfloss several times and the floss has come out pretty much clean each time.</li>
            <li> It likely does it in a more uniform and effective way than floss, particularly if you are not a skilled flosser.</li>
            <li> There is definitely room for user error to become an issue in how accurately this works.</li>
            <li> I really like this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the Water Pik, which I did not like at all.  </li>
            <li> So much quicker than flossing and mouth feels cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected however it can use more power...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seam to be cleaning between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It really does get and food particles out from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really replace the need for string flossing.  </li>
            <li> I really like the AirFloss.  </li>
            <li> The AirFloss works really well.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t string floss at all you really must get this.</li>
            <li> If you held the power button on it would work, but you can&#x27;t really use it with both hands.</li>
            <li> really like the unit.</li>
            <li> There is no pain, and the whole experience is over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So that alone tells me it’s not doing a capable job.  </li>
            <li> Works better than i expected.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it as much,</li>
            <li> and then I keep as much of the peroxide in my mouth and then brush my teeth with my Sonicare Elite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> works really well.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their teeth for life.</li>
            <li> cuz who ever does that, really?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I expected more.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return it because I threw the whole thing in the trash.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was not helpful and very arrogant.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how well it did.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommends this product and so do I!,</li>
            <li> Can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips...for nothin</li>
            <li> It works very well and the convenience of having a flosser at hand can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> you get a kickback that wets your whole chest area.  </li>
            <li> really wanted this to work because it&#x27;s cordless and has the air in the spurt.  </li>
            <li> This does the job very well when it works correctly, but it is very tempermental ands</li>
            <li> Purchased this product and it has really helped improve my gum issues...</li>
            <li> made my gum bleed, very awarkard to use.</li>
            <li> Dislodges food particles gently.</li>
            <li> Fast and convenient to use</li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I much prefer my water pic coupled with ultra texture floss.  </li>
            <li> caught my eye, but I didn&#x27;t really know what an air flosser was.  </li>
            <li> Does a better job than I expected.</li>
            <li> Would highly reco to all!</li>
            <li> It really gets the stuff between</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> so i really like it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare airfloss is so much easier than flossing and quicker too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ten-Twenty minutes later, the blinking charge light stopped blinking.  </li>
            <li> I really like the concept of the charging system.</li>
            <li> it seems to work because the dental hygenist doesnt complain about my gums as much as she used to.</li>
            <li> And, no gum bleeding by accidently applying too much</li>
            <li> and they were very understanding.</li>
            <li> the Philips Sonicare HX6921/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush (which I really like)</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a game changer like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased</li>
            <li> It works very well, stays charged.  </li>
            <li> so I was very keen to try it out.</li>
            <li> The idea of a device, in appearance very like an electric toothbrush, which does the job is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use mouthwash in the reservoir and it feels very thorough</li>
            <li> and it will burst streams of mouthwash between your teeth for a much cleaner and fresher feel.</li>
            <li> Recharge stand is very unstable when the flosser is attached.</li>
            <li> It would be marginally better than not flossing at all but just shooting a burst of mouthwash in between your teeth is not a real substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li> I use a Waterpik as part of my routine and that is capable of cleaning under the gums around all surfaces of the tooth.</li>
            <li> Either mouthwash or water can be poured into the reservoir and it shoots out in a gentle stream when the button is pressed.</li>
            <li> This leaves me feeling very minty.</li>
            <li> It really does help getting food particles out between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you still have to use real floss</li>
            <li> and of course that doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much to replace when it</li>
            <li> We used this maybe 10 times before the charging light went out and never came back on again!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> We used this maybe 10 times before the charging light went out and never came back on again!</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use than manuel flossing or using a Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> this is much quicker than flossing.  </li>
            <li> really cleans out the spaces between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It removed a lot of additional debris that I probably couldn&#x27;t reach very well with floss.  </li>
            <li> : But if you don&#x27;t floss, then this is probably better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing: You&#x27;d be better off buying a Sonicare toothbrush, floss and mouthwash and just using them properly</li>
            <li> This product rocks really.</li>
            <li> I gave it many tries and still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much cleaner since I have been using this device.  </li>
            <li> this works really well</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use then</li>
            <li> You know you don&#x27;t really floss.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than the tank flossers.</li>
            <li> The pack was opened before, very obviousely.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> and I also really like</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I do see a noticeable difference where plague does not build up as much. s</li>
            <li> i cannot find a place to by the part, i love it otherwise, especially with a fixed retainer wire...,,,,</li>
            <li> It is kind of a pain to set up, and in my humble opinion</li>
            <li> I used a waterpick back in the early 70&#x27;s and it seemed to me to work every bit as well or better than the Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;The way the Airfloss works is by single pulses of very little mist and mostly air which does not come close in my opinion to the effective Waterpik way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , the product pretty much works as advertised, and will deliver a sharp burst of water right between your teeth to help clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A big plus is that it leaves my mouth feeling very fresh, and not just like I used mouthwash by itself.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it worked great for as long as it lasted--which for me was less than three months.  </li>
            <li> Different sites favor one or the other and sound equally convincing.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 2 years - can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other brands, but not as great as expected.</li>
            <li> Did not find product easy to use  instructions not clear will have to consult with dentist on hoe to use .</li>
            <li> I very surprised the first time I used it at how well it cleaned.</li>
            <li> You will be left with a very minty clean</li>
            <li> The air flosser I originally got from Phillips stopped working after I had it for only a couple of months.</li>
            <li> They only go by the original purchase.  </li>
            <li> One gentleman is on his FOURTH unit - and your warranty is not reset every time; it remains the day of original purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is always a good idea to ask your dentist before using things like this, especially if you have work in progress or any other special situations or on-going issues and such.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is I really like sonicare products, and in general believe they make good stuff, but unfortunately I think that this particular device is ill-conceived and probably is not going to be used by many people.</li>
            <li> You would still need to use traditional dental floss to clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t clean between teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> No way will a burst of water clean like the physical &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; you get with floss.</li>
            <li> nearly $100 isn&#x27;t worth it to replace normal floss.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean especially when I use mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li> This tool has one function; to clean in-between teeth from the front only with a burst of air and water or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The unit did get the areas between my teeth clean in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you not only clean out the spaces in the bridge</li>
            <li> These things are amazing, and in my case, corrected problems with my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use alcohol-based mouthwash in mine, and in very little time my &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; under my gums began to shrink.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long and is incredibly important.</li>
            <li> The unit is comfortable to hold and keeps its charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I liked the small size and wireless option.  </li>
            <li> Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser is not a replacement for true flossing (with actual floss).</li>
            <li> It was able to clean between my teeth that had larger gaps, but did a poor job on tighter spaces that were already filled with a bit of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The area at the top that you press down to activate it would not budge.  </li>
            <li> So I went to their website, reported the problem, spoke to someone in the chat thing, and within a week they had sent me a new one!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product new and received it USED!  </li>
            <li> New concept, works very well.  </li>
            <li> Love one previously purchased.</li>
            <li> box advertises the air flosser \\&quot;removes up to 5x more plaque between teeth\\&quot; - but the tiny print at the bottom indicates that the comparison is between the air flosser and brushing your teeth, not the air flosser and traditional floss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two buttons--a main power button and the button to activate the air/water pulse.  </li>
            <li> Ok, So second test, Floss regularly, sonicare, then Airfloss.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much more likely to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> That may indeed be a decent product; however, the two products together rival my monthly car payment in cost.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with this item is the flimsy hinge on the door of the water compartment.</li>
            <li> You can probably get better results with traditional flossing, with a similar time investment.</li>
            <li> I only need a bigger reservoir, because I always have used more than one time between my teeths</li>
            <li> The main problem appears to be the battery and the execution of the &amp;#34;air flossing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> FOLLOWING UP MANY MONTHS LATER</li>
            <li> It only has very short periodic bursts of fluid/air pressure which do not seem to do much - glad</li>
            <li> For those of us with crooked teeth where traditional floss would get caught up and rip, this is a better option.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and doesn&#x27;t feel good in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare flosser for everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> just start making a high pitched whine and then do nothing.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this flosser and will never be without one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I highly recommend this product to all my patients.</li>
            <li> , I tried explaining that these have a high rate of defects and they denied it.</li>
            <li> Also, I tried explaining that these have a high rate of defects and they denied it.</li>
            <li> with that issue I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended...just like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Minor clean up required.  </li>
            <li> I found other posts on Sonicare&#x27;s own web site that reported similar nozzle failures.  </li>
            <li> DOESN&amp;#34;T APPEAR TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING</li>
            <li> I floss more often now because of ease of use and little fuss to use.</li>
            <li> There are no exposed metal pieces and the charging station looks like little more than a plastic peg.</li>
            <li> I tried a few more times and heard a loud **POP!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, and makes my mouth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Electric Flosser&amp;#34; is a modern twist on the old &amp;#34;Waterpics&amp;#34; you might remember from the 70&#x27;s and 80s.</li>
            <li> it leaves a much cleaner feeling and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my gums as sensitive to the burst of air that the Airflosser generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much easier than the old floss string.</li>
            <li> Anyhow the customer service young man at Phillips was very helpful and understanding had my replacement sent out immediately</li>
            <li> when doing it and painful so this airfloss is perfect</li>
            <li> Better dental exams in just a few months.</li>
            <li> This Electric Flosser will not make you dispense the normal dental floss.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t bring yourself to use traditional floss, this is worth considering.  </li>
            <li> I normally brush, floss and use the pick, then mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I tried couple of times first, it didn&#x27;t really work for various reasons...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it does a good job flushing out the food that a brush would miss.</li>
            <li> While I would say that using this is better than nothing, I definitely would not completely substitute the Airfloss for flossing.  </li>
            <li> While I would say that using this is better than nothing, I definitely would not completely substitute the Airfloss for flossing.  </li>
            <li> You have to charge it for 24 hrs before first use, and wait for the indicator light to turn green.</li>
            <li> I put mouthwash in the well of the flosser for better cleaning, however it was quite messy, as the pulse type button shoots the liquid between your teeth</li>
            <li> However, I found that even if I first used a brush, this device removed much food particles still left.</li>
            <li> that If you don&#x27;t normally floss, that you will be &amp;#34;more inclined&amp;#34; to use a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;(only you can answer that question)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: use normal floss or get a waterpik.</li>
            <li> Then there they went through the list of trouble shooting questions, including some questions that were beyond comical.  </li>
            <li> Although I have had problems in the past with my first one the customer service was awesome and they always took care of it very quickly without making you feel bad.</li>
            <li> A water-pik works better, IMO, and for half the price!</li>
            <li> Over more usage I did find that I ended up using this twice a day (not that I&#x27;d ever floss twice a day), and in the morning I preferred to use the mouthwash in the reservoir, while at night I ended up using plain water.</li>
            <li> Now it never stops right in the middle of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flosser was very effective in removing the debris and running my tongue around my mouth afterwards I was unable to detect any remaining meat.</li>
            <li> This means that if your teeth are really close together, are crooked, or overlap, you will not get the full benefits of flossing (i.e., getting into every nook and cranny to get every last bit of the food particles that the brush missed).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first few attempts, I finally mastered using this flosser without spritzing most of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I told my Hygienist about this new flosser and she may recommend the flosser to others.</li>
            <li> buy a new toy</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one, because mine died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(and a new nozzle)</li>
            <li> They mailed me a new one</li>
            <li> I was told to wait for a new Airflosser which should arrive in 2-3 days and use the enclosed label and the box the new Airflosser came in to return my cracked Airflosser.  </li>
            <li> The new Airflosser arrived and I returned the cracked one.</li>
            <li> Maybe they should have a replaceable battery as to replace with new unit</li>
            <li> I purchased a new one from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one .</li>
            <li> See if the unit lasted some two years, I might tolerate repairing or buying a new unit.</li>
            <li> Had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> While I am glad the phone representative understood my issue and seems to have resolved it, I have no assurance that my device was really new and not a refurbished/repackaged return from someone who spent some time charging the device prior to returning it.  </li>
            <li> your mouth is closed all the way around the end BEFORE you press the button, otherwise you will need some Windex to clean the spray off your mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but according to some reviewers, it DOES do at least as good a job as traditional flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If its low on charge, the light turns yellow.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for some people who have advanced gum disease with deep pockets around the teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting a little wet for healthy gums.</li>
            <li> husband has one too and loves his.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback--we each have our own because the individual sticks are not easy to change.</li>
            <li> The first one broke after 3 months, and the second broke after 5 months.</li>
            <li> I would even go so far as to say that Phillips is overly optimistic with their two year warranty!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was actually working</li>
            <li> For the first time, bleeding, big impact</li>
            <li> However the first one died within 6 months the second died yesterday.  </li>
            <li> It works consistently, and I use it once or twice daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that I found more food particles and \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; between my teeth using this,</li>
            <li> After 10-12 weeks the first replacement broke and we started using the second.</li>
            <li> I explained that their product obviously does not last for more than 10 months and that they need to fix the obvious flaw it has in its design.  </li>
            <li> ...otherwise suck it up and floss the old fashioned way!  </li>
            <li> Even if the price over time pays for itself in actual disposable floss purchases (which is why I was intrigued in the first place).  </li>
            <li> I chose this Sonicare Airfloss Flosser because I&#x27;ve enjoyed Sonicare products in the past</li>
            <li> After three months it completely died!  </li>
            <li> The Airfloss works pretty well, but only works from the front of the teeth.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time, I only wished I&#x27;d started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good complement to flossing or better than not flossing for those times when you might worry that your hands can&#x27;t be cleaned well enough to be germ-free and you don&#x27;t want to risk getting sick.</li>
            <li> So, I am using it every other day to ensure I can get a quality clean.  </li>
            <li> I use water rather than mouthwash, preferring to swish some mouthwash around following flossing, and I have noticed a significant change in my overall oral sensitivity and the infrequent bleeding I used to experience when flossing has gone away completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they were sending out used or refurbished units, but why replace a new design with the old design?  </li>
            <li> that said, the Philips Airfloss is STILL a very useful tool for helping you maintain healthy teeth and gum -- when it&#x27;s used as PART of a dental care regime like using mouthwash, brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily (with traditional floss), and visiting your dentist for checkup/cleaning every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and isn&#x27;t as messy as a waterpik.</li>
            <li> When I last went to the dentist, I was advised to be sure that I ran the floss up and down both sides of adjacent teeth</li>
            <li> Original review:  &amp;#34;I have had major gum problems even though I spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning, flossing waterpicking, etc...</li>
            <li> I have a bridge with two teeth missing and flossing under this is easy and complete with the Water-pic, but the Airfloss just doesn&#x27;t seem to work in these spaces.</li>
            <li> After a few times just fine.</li>
            <li> Wish the reservoir were about four times as large, needs several refills during a cleaning session.</li>
            <li> Literature claims reservoir is large enough for 1 or 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Also it takes twice as long to use this product as you have to clean both the inside and outside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Although a little expensive, this flosser workes great!!.</li>
            <li> There was hardly any tarter between my teeth and my gums look a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was going to be more like the old water pick, but the little burst of water is just not enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Tiny puffs of air don&#x27;t seem to clean anything, and if you use dental floss after &amp;#34;wind flossing&amp;#34; you quickly realize how little cleaning is actually taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flossing is better for you; it removes more of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Instructions do not make it clear that tip must be pushed into device until it snaps in place</li>
            <li> &quot; gets a solid 3 stars from our household.e too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the reviews were paid for by the vendors.</li>
            <li> Clearly these are defective and break after a month or so.</li>
            <li> Far inferior to dental flossing.</li>
            <li> I use either the automatic repeat action or take my time and press the activating button as I insert the tip between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Airfloss a few weeks ago and I now enjoy flossing.</li>
            <li> The automatic 1-second feature moves the process along and no messy water or mouthwash shooting out all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The reservoir holds more than enough water for my entire mouth and I have had zero issues with the function of the product after daily use for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This holds only a bit of water which doesn&#x27;t hold much force when ejected with air between teeth along with a thump against the teeth..  </li>
            <li> For one month I used it and found it jarring and loud.</li>
            <li> have been the only one to use it (gently).  </li>
            <li> With my food allergies and regular sore gums I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to deal with that much water in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> OK, I bought this primarily to take with me when I travel because toting a giant water irrigator is rather difficult.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This does have some advantages over the old Waterpics.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline.</li>
            <li> Product failures should not happen when they are so young.</li>
            <li> which means regular floss and the sonicare is all you really need.</li>
            <li> theres no sound technology in the this like the sonicare, Unless you consider the sound of the</li>
            <li> :  Works very well and removes food particles as big as flax seeds or chunks of meat.  </li>
            <li> The real test will be at my next dental visit to see if using the air flosser results in improved gum health and decreases &#x27;pockets&#x27; below the gum line</li>
            <li> I called the dentist professional line.</li>
            <li> I completely lost my money.</li>
            <li> Green light is going on for short(few seconds) time and goes off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t always floss that frequently.</li>
            <li> In fact, until I was about 16 years old, I never flossed.</li>
            <li> I remember the electric flossers of old - what a joke.</li>
            <li> I was told by the dentist&#x27;s office that it&#x27;s really to get people who don&#x27;t regularly floss to do something.  </li>
            <li> the meantime I purchased a Waterpik flosser and though it is bulkier than the Sonic, so far it is working.</li>
            <li> I did experience on caveat on early use.  </li>
            <li> Or those who just can&#x27;t stand flossing the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> Estimate those &#x27;floss&#x27; action toothbrushes at a one and no flossing at zero</li>
            <li> and I shipped the old one to them to fix.</li>
            <li> The slightest bump and the whole unit instantly tips</li>
            <li> Flossing unit size is a bit larger than it really needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I saw they make a gadget for flossing, naturally I figured this could be the answer to my flossing</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but I am guessing she is going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> will be checking back in a month to let you know how I REALLY feel about the Airfloss.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend it, but keep your box and warranty near by!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 81 year old mother&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> the only problem is that the flosser does not hold much liquid at all, I always have to refill after each floss.  </li>
            <li> For the price it should last much longer.  </li>
            <li> The item is warranteed for two years, so I contacted Amazon and was advised to contact Philips directly.</li>
            <li> The instructions said that the water would last for the whole mouth cleaning</li>
            <li> The thing that I have not learned by daily use to overcome is the messiness of the whole operation.  </li>
            <li> They sent out a replacement unit but it was the old design - like my 3 year old one that died.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend,Like i said doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.</li>
            <li> If you check reviews and professional tests</li>
            <li> and you end up having to floss the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these through a professional trial offer,one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums at all and they seem much healthier than before with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;ve used it for a month they don&#x27;t bleed, just like you were actually flossing for real.  </li>
            <li> However, I doesn&#x27;t take much time to use and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding gums, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if any improvement on my next dental visit in three months.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the back teeth.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to fire the plastic nozzle 5 feet through the air if it is not seated properly and snapped into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Manual bursts by pressing the button up top (at the green colored incline) for each individual burst, or putting it in 1-second burst mode, where it shoots a burst every 1 second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gotten better about it around our house over the last few years but the fact still remains that no one seems to like to floss.  </li>
            <li> i hate flossing, but this is great and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE AND VERY LITTLE TIME.  </li>
            <li> next week, I flossed via the conventional method first to start with clean spaces between my teeth and then tried to use the Airfloss daily after that.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t slick but it isn&#x27;t really easy to hold with damp hands either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean well and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The sensation of mist and air blowing between my teeth was odd, but Im sure it is a personal preference of mine and not a universal feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second unit has the exact same problem.</li>
            <li> but the second might be an issue (I will try) as it is 10 days older than 1 year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is JUNK and they MUST be aware of it as I cannot be the ONLY person having multiple failures!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think it is guaranteed for 2 years but had to send the first one back after one month, and the second one quit just over one year.</li>
            <li> The only thing which I notice that this unit has to be charge 24 hours each time, not only first time.</li>
            <li> Never thought it did much, flossed first anyway, messy.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT, also, though not too significant, Feels CHEAP compared to sonicare which is dense, heavy and seamless,  holds just enough water for your one round, it drips (no biggie), and the stand makes it wobbly.</li>
            <li> much cheaper and takes about as long.</li>
            <li> last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum.</li>
            <li> And last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They pitch this to someone who doesn&#x27;t normally floss their teeth, and as a &amp;#34;30 second cleaning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t agree with the logic.</li>
            <li> So I would add this to a daily routine with normal flossing, not a substitution.  </li>
            <li> Like most people, I don’t floss nearly as much as I should, especially since I have poor gums.  </li>
            <li> Will give it full stars if the water doesn&#x27;t keep spraying messily (the part where it&#x27;s joint).</li>
            <li> (Pack of 6)]] which takes up hardly any space in the drawer and is easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, this is messier than flossing, though almost certainly more sanitary as long as you keep the tip clean.d a bit to make sure you&#x27;re not drooling it out everywhere, but it is virtually impossible to do this for all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> My Airfloss has developed a unique characteristic that might be due to my exclusive use of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second one I own, but unfortunately, the first one only worked about 2 years</li>
            <li> My main issue when using this flosser was it was just a little too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Does a better job than regular floss for those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The new unit stopped working as well, after several weeks.  </li>
            <li> But I only paid 30 (made an offer on ebay and had some ebay bucks) and it is much faster than regular flossing</li>
            <li> The light started blinking again and stopped a few seconds later.  </li>
            <li> Add to that the unit isn&#x27;t truly considered a replacement for standard flossing and there are enough reasonable caveats to give one pause.    </li>
            <li> I will try the product for some more time but it looks like it is going on the same negative direction as my sonicare toothbrush and the glosser&#x27; predecessor also by Philips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped this product might be good, but it was a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The split looks like it&#x27;s right down a manufacturing mold line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for the price it will last a long time and make it worth such an investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not as messy as the Water-Pic that was relegated to a shelf in my garage a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Using this is less painful and more effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had portable water-piks in the past that were just a pain to keep clean.</li>
            <li> After just a few months the plastic casing is cracked in several places, the water chamber is gunky funky but resistant to cleaning, and the bursts of air/water are significantly weaker.  </li>
            <li> So I am not in a position of having a dead unit and can&#x27;t get a replacement for the 3rd time without providing my original receipt.  </li>
            <li> Snapping the tip at first required more force than I&#x27;d anticipated, but I&#x27;ve learned that it really must be snug to work properly, so when I remove it for cleaning, I double check to be sure it&#x27;s firmly seated in the base.  </li>
            <li> detailed instructions are hard to find.</li>
            <li> One is, that since individual blasts are sent once a second, you can position the device, and then receive the single blast of water right between your teeth.</li>
            <li> My gum disease is completely gone and the pockets are getting smaller</li>
            <li> i got this item from my orthodontist&#x27;s office, after i done with Invisalign, doctor had glued fixed retention to the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a continuous stream and I was surprised by the tiny reservoir.  </li>
            <li> i spend about 15 minutes each night cleaning my teeth with manual brush, sonicare brush, airfloss, manual floss, water pik because i have spent so much money on bridges, implants, etc and have spent too much time and pain in dentist chair since i was a child.</li>
            <li> Works relatively well but it does not feel like a complete substitute for normal&lt;br /&gt;Flossing to me.  </li>
            <li> Instead I reverted back to my old Oral B satin</li>
            <li> double cleaning action....</li>
            <li> and we were back in action within a week.</li>
            <li> but after a year it developed the same problem</li>
            <li> is kind of useless.</li>
            <li> It was an interesting idea but poorly built.  </li>
            <li> I always seem to make a mess if I try to fill the reservoir to the top in the way of it splashing out when I close the little</li>
            <li> After using the original for this long, those little differences show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thru Flossers Mint which work better and are less trouble.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik uses high pressure water to remove particles and plaque and does that very well yet has a cheap battery that dies very fast and annoying  </li>
            <li> This is a very minor issue that might be caused by my mouthwash clogging something up inside the unit that would normally prevent an air-lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was making a HUGE wet mess every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve read other reviews and apparently this flosser works well depending on how much space there is in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> My first time using it, it &#x27;hiccuped&#x27; and shot one, paused, then shot the other 2, and then when i pulled it away from my mouth it shot the 3rd shot.....almost into my eyes.</li>
            <li> We use this product very gently and are extra careful to only have water touch the reservoir.</li>
            <li> We use this product very gently and are extra careful to only have water touch the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time trying to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Also cleans other teeth very well.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, I was expecting a little bit more from Sonicare but this product just don&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> first one conked out after 3 months, do not waste your money total waste</li>
            <li> The main difference is that floss will help remove large bits of food (liked trapped bits of popcorn or chicken) and the documentation on this explicitly says that it is not designed to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolute, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not real cheap but how much would u pay to keep your teeth?</li>
            <li> In a short amount of time there is a complete different in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> Using the Airfloss is easier and faster than flossing, and I immediately developed the habit of of using it daily, whereas I would blow off flossing often enough that my gums were affected.  </li>
            <li> May work well enough for some people without any gum disease although I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> My first try with the Airfloss was a little messy--TIP:</li>
            <li> The first time I called worked just a little.</li>
            <li> We purchased our first Airfloss a little over two years ago.</li>
            <li> I suppose that to keep the price down, certain sacrifices had to be made.</li>
            <li> My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  </li>
            <li> My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  </li>
            <li> Generally speaking, I still use floss, but when my gums are extra sore I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please note, as other reviewers have commented, this is not intended to replace regular flossing, but instead to supplement it for a healthier gumline and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself works very well</li>
            <li> I received this not long ago and I already have to call in to get a replacement or</li>
            <li> But, not long after we purchased it the nozzle started leaking then</li>
            <li> /&gt;This thing can get pretty messy.</li>
            <li> Although my gums didn&#x27;t bleed (as per the warning in the instructions), they did feel sore the first few times I used the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly spend less time than flossing (including twice a day now) and it&#x27;s not inconvenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a major issue but perhaps this will be fixed in a later model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset that this is breaking down like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing with a variety of different devices ever since, including but not limited to all kinds of floss, dental tape, Oral-B flosser with a handle, flosser toothpicks, and the hummingbird flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made sure you press down hard and hear it snap before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third Airflosser after the first two just stopped working after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> The Airfloss doesn&#x27;t really get deep down in along the sides of the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- as the fluid gets partway used it must be held straight up and down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the large side to hold</li>
            <li> If you are just lazy and want some cool gadget that will floss for you, then either go and spend 2 million dollars and buy a robot to floss your teeth, or just spend $2 at CVS and buy some floss instead of $80 here because that $2 will go a lot further in the long run from saving you from gum disease...not to mention heart disease--&gt;[...</li>

            <li> Putting aside a couple of (possibly) minor technical faults and issues relating to the battery and charger, from a pure usage point of view there are other factors which prompted me to send mine back today for a refund.    </li>
            <li> The only thing to note is that you really do need to keep your mouth closed whilst using it (unlike one of the illustrations) as it does tend to potentially spray a long way!</li>
            <li> It takes a few squirts between certain teeth for me</li>
            <li> As I hate flossing, I was always looking for an easier or more fun way to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel unit and cannot believe Phillips made something completely ineffective and worthless considering how good the sonic care toothbrush is.</li>
            <li> I absolutely prefer it to dental floss and all the other different little tools used to clean the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> It works very well and you can use it with just plain water or with your preferred Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> There is really no way to open and examine without destroying the unit since it&#x27;s very much a product of the &amp;#34;Disposable</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and had positive experiences with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that the unit barely holds enough liquid (mouthwash) to complete one round of flossing.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the other leading product.</li>
            <li> If you already floss daily you may not need this, but if you have trouble making yourself floss every day, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too high for healing gums.  </li>
            <li> I was able to charge only two times in the past and now I am trying to charge for past two weeks!</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a product in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets into the spaces between teeth and above a tight fitting bridge that was impossible to clean under any other way.  </li>
            <li> This product comes highly recommended and clinically you can notice the results after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough.</li>
            <li> overpriced but does what it say it does and having just spent $1000 dollars having molars and wisdoms extracted it might be worth it, I just use the mouthwash in it and not my hard water which would probably clog it quickly (alternately use  distilled water)and close your mouth or it&#x27;ll spray</li>
            <li> This is small and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s for at least those three reasons that I am an avid flosser.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well but gums bleed excessively .</li>
            <li> Seems to the job, but have not used it long enough to know how well it works.</li>
            <li> Would have returned, but had been out of town and waited to long to open.</li>
            <li> I have used a WaterPik for a long time and thought this would be a portable version of something similar.  </li>
            <li> Philips says that they should be replaced every 6 months, so that implies they should last that long.  </li>
            <li> I also pointed out that ALL the reviews on their site said that it didn&#x27;t last long - and neither do the replacements they send.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a sizable number of comments on Amazon about the thing not lasting long.  </li>
            <li> I just received this as a Christmas present and have been wanting one for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you won&#x27;t do 24 charge each time, it wont last you long.</li>
            <li> A couple of replacement nozzles also didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> It can also be a \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot; option on days/nights where you may be too tired or brain dead for a proper manual</li>
            <li> I have a cavity behind a crown I can&#x27;t get fixed until the crown comes of (very expensive proposition) and this works beautifully to get food out of that area.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a little more power behind the discharge of liquid  (mouthwash) used in the flossing.  </li>
            <li> And it does not take very long to charge, maybe only an hour or two (not like my Clarisonic....</li>
            <li> Been using for a month and my teeth are much less sensitive, but I also follow the instructions and floss too.  </li>
            <li> You can use any type of liquid with it, such as cavity preventative, moisturizer for dry mouth, mouthwash, or just water.  </li>
            <li> However, it is less than a year old and no longer works.  </li>
            <li> For the expensive price I just expected more.  </li>
            <li> Either you have a water tank with lots of water that allows you to complete the job, or you have one of the smaller versions that requires you to fill it a few times before you are done.</li>
            <li> When it flies off, it may land anywhere - like inside your toilet (which is what happened to mine).</li>
            <li> Definitely keep your lips closed around the stem though as you will get blow back on you mirror if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> While the Airfloss did indeed get food and such out from behind the wire, I found the air/water burst from the unit a bit too powerful given the angle I had to use it</li>
            <li> Quick floss time of approximately 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been holding a charge for me, but I must add that I really do like to keep it on the base plugged into an outlet, as I&#x27;ve been doing with my Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> The battery is very long lasting, it can be utilized numerous times on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really brushing well enough and have to step up the game a little more.</li>
            <li> you cannot set it down while the fluid cap is open (say to open the mouthwash bottle).</li>
            <li> No dental floss any more, never like those scary strings, waxed or no wax, never liked them, but the unwaxed version is good for cutting cakes</li>
            <li> /&gt;The poof of air could be a little stronger, but if targeted properly, and if you don&#x27;t have really tight spaces between your teeth, it should be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes too much so.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a product that is twice as expensive and not even half as good.</li>
            <li> In the time it takes to fill the tiny reservoir with water or mouthwash, prime the unit, floss my teeth, rinse the nozzle, rinse, empty and dry the reservoir, I could have flossed with string multiple times and been done with it.    </li>
            <li> Also the water chamber that is billed as lasting 3 uses only lasts for half my mouth and I am not a mutant with double the teeth.  </li>
            <li> For example, in situations where tooth location and dexterity issues may make it hard to get to a particular spot with traditional floss or floss picks.</li>
            <li> mechanism is a little loud once you engage the button to release the shot of water.  </li>
            <li> I have some teeth where they are close together and the Airfloss has trouble getting between them, but placing the head at an angle or moving it a little farther up seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> did replace the nozzle one time when they were on sale, but I didn’t really need to because it seems they hardly wear out at all.</li>
            <li> My problem is that I did not like the feeling of its use, the process seems to take a long time to finish, and I still prefer using the WaterPik over this product.</li>
            <li> Still no action.  </li>
            <li> see how long the replacement tip lasts (I&#x27;ll be watching this</li>
            <li> I know it doesn’t take long, but the laziness factor kicks it at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> I have been a life long floss hater.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it out with floss, which only seems to pack it in harder.  </li>
            <li> This will get SOME stuff dislodged from your teeth, but it&#x27;s not a real substitute for regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also concerned about long term cleaning of a unit like this.</li>
            <li> My flossed also developed a crack by the power button within a few months for no reason I can figure out.  </li>
            <li> have returned it a long time ago</li>
            <li> Complete waste.  </li>
            <li> A phone call to their customer-service department was left unanswered, and now I&#x27;m thoroughly disenchanted with Philips at this point.  </li>
            <li> Small but inconvenient price to pay for a good product........</li>
            <li> as good as I am at brushing and showing up for my 6-month dental checkups - I HATE flossing.  </li>
            <li> There is a mode that you can hold the button down and it will spray every second so that you can keep going and do your entire mouth in one shot.</li>
            <li> You can either do the \\&quot;auto-burst\\&quot; function--which menas you hold down the activation button and the spray bursts every second, or you can choose to control the pace yourself and press the \\&quot;single-burst\\&quot; function to release individual bursts.</li>
            <li> After doing the first half of my teeth I need to open the reservoir lid to release pressure, otherwise hardly anything is dispensed from the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I then refill the travel size bottle from a large size when needed using a very small funnel.  </li>
            <li> so you cannot see where the end of the tool is inside your mouth, so sometimes it takes longer than one second for me to get situate between each groove of my teeth--and sometimes it takes me less, or else I stop at a tooth where I like to get an extra spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can feel real improvements in less than a few months.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate flossing and this electric flosser makes what could be a burdensome chore, fun and quick.</li>
            <li> Now the air wand has starting leaking and spraying mouthwash all over my face, on the mirror, big mess.  </li>
            <li> Needs a flat surface on the back side so you can set it down to fill reservoir.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was so excited, I ignored the reviews that often, this product doesn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> The second unit arrived DOA, once again due to the battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The device came in packaging different from that I seen in other places.</li>
            <li> just stopped working, low quality, other?</li>
            <li> They abruptly said call back when you have the serial number!  </li>
            <li> Not willing to spend $70 on a flosser that can&#x27;t last longer than that.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a very long time before brushing with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had two that I bought from Costco in a two pack -  BOTH of them died not long from each other!</li>
            <li> The only negative I can find is trying to completely fill the reservoir without spilling mouthwash all over it and my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought one on Amazon, and same thing....great for few weeks, then suddenly stops working.</li>
            <li> Our dentist stated she saw improvement in my husband&#x27;s gums in just a few months, so I would definitely recommend as an addition to regular brushing and rinsing to help with gum problem!</li>
            <li> The other advantage is that it is effective in clearing small gaps between teeth where it is difficult to get a probe.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is a little small and the cover over it is a little flimsy, but it is worth being careful not to have a big Waterpic on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]], since counterspace is limited</li>
            <li> You can choose auto burst or single burst with the push of the button.</li>
            <li> I do wish it were a little bit more stable when installed on the charging base, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged very often.  </li>
            <li> Good for those areas with braces or wires where regular floss is difficult or near impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll conclude with a final word for people who are not flossing regularly: One way to encourage yourself to floss at least once daily is to use colored floss</li>
            <li> Not worth the expense if you have a standard base-tube-appliance model.</li>
            <li> then it developed a small crack just below the water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how they could even be fixed, but when used on front teeth it causes spray and it will get all over the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> It is so sad that a product like this is not guranteed for full year AS DESCRIBED BY SONICARE.</li>
            <li> Given that it cost a small fortune, I am not happy that it wasn&#x27;t obvious that the product was new rather than just new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use it in combination with the Sonicare Black Diamond Professional electric toothbruth (about $190 less $20.00 rebate)</li>
            <li> It has worn down with only flossing two times a day.</li>
            <li> It would turn on, but pushing the pulse button would shut it down totally.</li>
            <li> You can either press the pulse button intermittently to activate the spray as needed, or hold it down to activate a spray every one second.  </li>
            <li> I got through the teeth cleaning without incident and then while cleaning the appliance I left the unit turned and while wiping it down</li>
            <li> instead I put Listerine in the fluid compartment, less than a cupful and use as directed.</li>
            <li> I can say that it did blast out bits of coarsely ground black pepper that was between my teeth.</li>
            <li> only complaints about it is that the unit itself is quite big in size, and for its size it has a relatively small reservoir for holding the water / mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> If you have spots where even thin floss barely makes it through then the Airflosser will make a loud noise signaling no water (or mouthwash) is making it out of</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside though, the replacement heads are pretty expensive, and you cannot floss from the back.</li>
            <li> I used this for only three weeks before my 6-month dental cleaning, and the hygienist said my gums had improved over the previous visit.</li>
            <li> SOOO I should get started by reading the quick start guide and using the wrong mouthwash?</li>
            <li> This one is a little harsh for a new user.</li>
            <li> The last issue I have with this product is the mess.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to hold your mouth closed a bit to make sure you&#x27;re not drooling it out everywhere, but it is virtually impossible to do this for all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> the only problem i have is it leaks a little when you put the mouth wash in and use it in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this because the pockets in my gums had become a little too deep.  </li>
            <li> The liquid container could be a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the little reservoir is not quite large enough to do your entire mouth like this</li>
            <li> My 10 year old sons orthodontist suggested the item to help with hard to floss areas with braces.  </li>
            <li> Phillips should use a soft rubber as a plug instead of hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;&#x27;s hard for me to get the floss positioned for the back teeth in my tiny mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was shocked at how much better her gums and teeth</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure how long the flosser heads last</li>
            <li> least this seems to be a DIFFERENT problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to think Philips has no interest in actually fixing the flaws with this</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I wish the reservoir for water/mouthwash was a bit larger.</li>
            <li> By keeping the mouth closed, liquid remains in the mouth</li>
            <li> Stopped working only a few months after it arrived.</li>
            <li> but when i read the booklet careful again</li>
            <li> You have to keep your mouth closed</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes .</li>
            <li> I recommend it, especially if you have trouble with floss.</li>
            <li> Even though I closed my lips around the tip it still sprayed water on the mirror/counter.  </li>
            <li> My neck gets all wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful.</li>
            <li> I was quite partial to the WaterPik until the button on my handle started sticking to the point it was unusable</li>
            <li> tried the unit over roughly a month.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to floss with the unit after not flossing for roughly a week, I found the unit was quite ineffective.  </li>
            <li> This is the answer for those who have trouble with traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> waste-- floss not the same thing</li>
            <li> not what I expected ...messy to use.</li>
            <li> NOT what I expected.  </li>
            <li> so you must keep your mouth closed when using.</li>
            <li> The on-line Chat Customer Service is based somewhere else; however, the location of it was unknown to my telephone CS Rep.  </li>
            <li> performs as advertized and does what I expected</li>
            <li> not really all that helpful.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended but is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Careful, folks.</li>
            <li> but I have trouble doing all my teeth w/o refilling in the middle.</li>
            <li> be careful not to buy mouthwash containing &amp;#34;ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE&amp;#34; as it will damage the &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare Airfloss&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> one jammed.  </li>
            <li> It worked 1-2 months, not very well.</li>
            <li> No one can repair it, total waste of $80.</li>
            <li> not very well sealed from water</li>
            <li> Someone once told me learning to floss regularly is harder then quitting smoking.</li>
            <li> Im hoping it last for a few years.....</li>
            <li> I expected a continuous stream.  </li>
            <li> Keep your mouth closed when using or it will get all over the mirror.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> for those of us with extensive crowns, bridges, and partial  whatevers, this gadget is a waste of time and effort.  </li>
            <li> I am unsure if it is defective or a design flaw but this honestly makes me hate the product.</li>
            <li> Nothing can replace the manual action of using a small string between your teeth!  </li>
            <li> Device only works from outside, air &#x27;pulse&#x27; is too weak, takes too long to recycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly is no substitute for flossing to remove stubborn food particles.  </li>
            <li> In other words, for one reason or another, it stops working properly after a few months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The button that you depress for it to function doesn&#x27;t work unless I use all the strength I have in my fingers to press down on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes, I floss after using the new air flosser and can&#x27;t believe the stuff regular floss removes that this useless invention doesn&#x27;t even touch.  </li>
            <li> I quickly mastered how to aim it at the point at the base between teeth, and, WOW, it shot the gunk out my pocket.  </li>
            <li> I like that the Airfloss in quiet and less messy than the Water PIk, I don&#x27;t think that it is getting the job done.</li>
            <li> and I have had no leaks or other problems.</li>
            <li> Normally I  would throw away a broken \\&quot;electronic toy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 2 settings, one manually sends a burst and the other sends a pulsing burst.  </li>
            <li> A bit skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> I went to use my Airfloss as usual this morning only to find</li>
            <li> And considering the fact that these nozzles cost a small fortune ($9.50 a piece for something that likely costs about 50 cents to manufacture!)</li>
            <li> No problem with battery as mentioned in other posts, after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> With my sever food allergies I cannot use toothpaste due to the flavorings, but with the Sonicare Elite toothbrush you would never know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I used this, then flossed...</li>
            <li> the other hand, this does use a blast of air and water to push food particles from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I had never used an electric flosser.</li>
            <li> overall i like this airfloss but not sure about the reliablity.  </li>
            <li> I started using one of the replacements and put the other away.</li>
            <li> Not much better than their standard models.  </li>
            <li> At first I think he was skeptical</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it will overshoot through a wider gap, and sting the tongue or other side of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used nothing but manual string floss and dental floss picks in the past, I was in for quite a different flossing experience with the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX8211 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser.\\</li>
            <li> They recommend replacing the nozzle every 6 months&lt;br /&gt;You can buy additional nozzles for other family members but aside from the included travel case with this unit with one head there is no additional storage for floss heads.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> the documentation it indicates that it doesn&#x27;t replace actual flossing, so I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is.  </li>
            <li> is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> The design is made for only front surface irrigation and the fill chamber for holding water or mouthwash is too small for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue to try using this Airfloss when away from home; after one months intermittant use I am unable to rate this higher.</li>
            <li> I explained the nozzle hasn&#x27;t been damaged but due to flexiing it&#x27;s split due to a manufacturing fault and they should review the manufacturing process.    </li>
            <li> my mom said she&#x27;d pay for the one I opened and give it a try, but the other sits in my closet, unopened.</li>
            <li> I recently received a bridge, and feel this removes food debris as well if not better than threading the floss.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Sounds like the registration is simply a method to get your e mail and bombard you to buy new products    Very poor customer support from Phillips.    </li>
            <li> Very, very hesitant to order another due to very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Most people hate flossing and do it fast and sloppy.</li>
            <li> They sent me two new units to replace the broken ones along with a postage paid return label.</li>
            <li> I would then go over with a regular floss and find that in a few instances the Airflosser did not get a few food particles out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not suitable, in my opinion, for areas around implants especially.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone who dislikes flossing the conventional way.</li>
            <li> The biggest \\&quot;flaw\\&quot; in this product is that it calls itself a \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; which invites comparison to the outcome you experience when you use conventional floss.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is slightly less, the pump makes slightly less noise, the water cover snaps closed tighter, and the trigger is easier to press.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not streaming too hard, but just enough to feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that the Airfloss does have a tendency to die, either from hard water (I recommend that it be used with a periodontal preventive rinse) as the one that I use has lasted, but my wife&#x27;s has not.</li>
            <li> hit my lens hard enough to leave a mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not useful.</li>
            <li> We used them on average 3x per week.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle even</li>
            <li> Frustrated that while it worked well for a short time that it broke completely after only two months.</li>
            <li> At least this seems to be a DIFFERENT problem.</li>
            <li> Not worth effort to try and get a replacement as the thing accomplishes almost nothing in the dental hygiene department.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH IT......</li>
            <li> Like many others, I hate to floss.  </li>
            <li> (With your mouth closed or it gets messy.)  </li>
            <li> Apologies to the designer, but I can&#x27;t find anything good to say about this outrageously overpriced machine.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing and this item makes me want to floss a lot more and take care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Mine are uneven - some are tight and some are loosely spaced.</li>
            <li> Wish it could be dialed down a notch.</li>
            <li> Another thing I do not like, as it gives NO warning, when the battery is wearing down.</li>
            <li> (unless you want to use this while driving down the road... I&#x27;ve seen people brushing while driving...</li>
            <li> There seems to be a little getting used to it, as it can feel a little unsettling at first.  </li>
            <li> what I could gather from other comments, if anyone says they dropped it, even just a few inches, they refuse to honor the warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have a few big gaps between some of my teeth which it is really hard to get stuff out of.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after less than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m on my third unit in less than 18 months, which just failed in the same way.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in less than a month.</li>
            <li> The waterpic is half the price</li>
            <li> typically use mouth wash and do a couple of pumps between each tooth.</li>
            <li> so I do end up having to refill it about half way through.</li>
            <li> I can keep a small plastic cup by my chair for the small amount of fluid</li>
            <li> Like most, I hate flossing; messy and floss shreds.</li>
            <li> I had one previous Sonicare airflosser</li>
            <li> It did not have the &amp;#34; flossing power&amp;#34; of one previously purchased.</li>
            <li> However, given such a history, that it fails just around the warrany expiration period, I have NO FAITH that the unit that I buy or repair will last a year!</li>
            <li> I am tempted to give it 3 just because I think it is such terrible marketing taking advantage of lazy people, but I enjoy the product IN ADDITION TO MY REGULAR FLOSS that I am sticking with four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am tempted to give it 3 just because I think it is such terrible marketing taking advantage of lazy people, but I enjoy the product IN ADDITION TO MY REGULAR FLOSS that I am sticking with four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not as messy as the conventional water flossers.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I take that back; not good at all</li>
            <li> Both seem fairly slow to me and it seems to take a long time to get through the process between each tooth.  </li>
            <li> What I remember reading was that the flosser was only meant to be used from the front end of the teeth; in other word, not from behind the teeth.  </li>
            <li> A little over a year and a half ago we stumbled upon the Philips Sonicare Airfloss.  </li>
            <li> it is compact, less messy , less noise, it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to the way it&#x27;s meant to be used, but once you get that down</li>
            <li> Plus, I have tight spacing between my teeth and the Airfloss never gets stuck and breaks.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a Waterpik  ( too messy) and then an Oralirrigator by Toilet Tree (too messy and hard to aim on the bottom</li>
            <li> Does not clean as suggested.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, but using this is so easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> Also, it is much less messy and easier to use than WaterPick sysstems we&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasted half an hour with Sonicare customer service -</li>
            <li> One reason the surface gets a little slippery is because I tend to get a couple of drips on the handle while filling.</li>
            <li> but then I noticed that my gums did bleed a little bit</li>
            <li> It takes almost no time, using little water, and it does not hurt as you try as you don&#x27;t have to struggle to get it between those close together teeth.</li>
            <li> a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I never use mouthwash, I prefer to put a little bit of mouthwash into the Airflosser (the alternative is water).</li>
            <li> this little number</li>
            <li> The water in the little reservoir runs out before doing all my teeth, so I have to stop and refill</li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> handle does not fit tightly in the charger.</li>
            <li> If you are too busy or lazy to go to the trouble of manually flossing your teeth, you can at least use this Airfloss devise to attempt to blast icky build-up out from between your teeth using water.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as floss.</li>
            <li> , It is a little messy</li>
            <li> but it is a little messy to use.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly charges the piece well, and while I can&#x27;t vouch for the two weeks of charge (I put it back on the base after every use)</li>
            <li> This piece of hard plastic used as a door to be opened and closed on the reservoir is not doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, everyday.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had two of them that stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly cheap to begin with, but recommeded by my oral hygienist.  </li>
            <li> (Johnson and Johnson Reach makes a waxed mint floss that&#x27;s green in color).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s messy and</li>
            <li> I bought two and had to return both to Phillips after approximately  6 months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> It just seems dead and doesn&#x27;t respond at all when I press the button.  </li>
            <li> It is just dead.  </li>
            <li> and I tried a few of the troubleshoot things.  </li>
            <li> It is dead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this unreliable product.</li>
            <li> tHE NOZZEL DID NOT FIT THE HANDLE</li>
            <li> THEY SENT ME NEWER MODEL HANDLE WHICH WORKED AND KNOCKED $15.00 off my card for my trouble.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.............</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money, counter-space and electricity.  </li>
            <li> Well, if that&#x27;s the case, then I&#x27;m in trouble.</li>
            <li> Also, it is messy.</li>
            <li> It take a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Used a few weeks and feel the food that&#x27;s removed.</li>
            <li> Giving three stars since it was working for a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Airfloss for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s quite messy with spray going everywhere</li>
            <li> remove food left behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I also felt that the electric flosser was unnecessarily harsh.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not a deal breaker), you press the button a few times to prime it and then shoot the mouthwash in-between each tooth \\&quot;joint\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few days to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> but I have to refill it a few times in one use.</li>
            <li> it hurts, and is ,messy and doesn&#x27;t get the debris out.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on this device.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for  a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but it is messy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Water-pic for years and wanted to try this because the Water-pic is messy.  </li>
            <li> problem I have is that the battery goes dead and won&#x27;t take a charge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After a few uses it just quit working for no discernible reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and the flexing of the nozzles has caused them to split in two.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY.....</li>
            <li> The device is not exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about this is the base it sits on.</li>
            <li> Flossing always hurts because the force required to get even the thinnest, slickest floss between my teeth jams the floss down into my gums once it gets past the contact surface.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have a small, narrow mouth with tight contacts between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a little messy at first, at the worst it resulted in drops on the counter and mirror, and I have since learned to use it with very minimal splash back.</li>
            <li> I use mouthwash in it instead of plain water.</li>
            <li> The liquid reservoir can contain plain water or your choice of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> water reservoir in the handle is a little small.</li>
            <li> The cleaning was much quicker and much less painful than before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually write reviews but have this product since December and paid less than $70 for it - now it is completely dead and price has skyrocketed!</li>
            <li> I had trouble flossing because my mouth is small and it was just a pain to do.</li>
            <li> A month and a half after receiving this product the hard plastic piece used to hold water in the reservoir is not working.</li>
            <li> main drawback that I experience was that, if I held it slightly wrong, the force behind the air and water could sting my tongue a little.</li>
            <li> It was not very effective at all.  </li>
            <li> Stupid me, I left my almost three year old Airfloss in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with the one second burst of a drip of water mixed with a burst of air every few seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;apart and split down the middle starting at the base.  </li>
            <li> Pulse it gives out is a little hard.  </li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong because mine needs daily recharging.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a flosser for lazy people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to tell whether or not the charger is working.</li>
            <li> The two replacements also failed within the same timeframe.  </li>
            <li> I usually load it with Listerine mouthwash and haven&#x27;t had</li>
            <li> Battery failed after only 3 months and can&#x27;t get any help from Philips Australia.</li>
            <li> The alcohol corrodes the internal workings rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Flossing is usually a chore</li>
            <li> Does not hold enough liquid and does a mediocre job</li>
            <li> Helped my dental hygiene a lot as im one of the lazy people who would rather do 100 push up than flossing...</li>
            <li> Each unit failed electronically where it would no longer stay turn on, finally failing permanently.  </li>
            <li> The unit can not be disassembled to check out why it failed, as I demonstrated after getting my second unit.  </li>
            <li> I have some small decay on a couple of teeth, so I do it twice on each side</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have bought my last Philips product.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t use it in the back of your teeth which is weird.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for the constant replacements needed.</li>
            <li> This takes some work and getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you hate to floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can fill the small reservoir with either water or mouth wash, your choice.</li>
            <li> I was not able to register the product in Autralia</li>
            <li> Reservoir is too small as well...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it died last night.</li>
            <li> Only problem is, I was unable to find any replacement heads for it, except on-line.</li>
            <li> now use mouthwash in my Airfloss and find that a small travel size bottle is the easiest way to refill the small reservoir.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I usually finish flossing in under 2 minutes with this.</li>
            <li> The capacity of the tank is too small.</li>
            <li> The capacity of the tank is too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of damaged rechargeable battery cells or if water somehow leaked into the electrical circuit.</li>
            <li> another just quit working a third works, but the tip no longer clicks in and its therefore useless.  </li>
            <li> like it cleans as well if not better than floss.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
            <li> Usually the orthodontist has her brush and waterpik after the wire is taken off.  </li>
            <li> This Phillips Airfloss does not do a comperable job removing small particals remaining after thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working until I go to the dentist, but until then....</li>
            <li> I get that with a small water source in the handle</li>
            <li> It just feels loose and a little weird like it shouldn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> It is very messy to use.</li>
            <li> I am not a great fan of flossing and therefore use an assortment of dental probes to remove foreign bodies from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The base of the device and the detachable floss tip are individually wrapped for extra protection.</li>
            <li> The quality control on this product is not very good.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed that I had so much scraping to be done.  </li>
            <li> , so know that there is a possibility the unit may fail, but I have registered on-line and have uploaded my purchase receipt to the registration page, so will just make use of the long warranty if I need</li>
            <li> Hard to tell....</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I think about folks who can&#x27;t press as hard as I can on the button that activates the spray.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and it is hard to use floss.  </li>
            <li> It was the rubber button + hard plastic connectors.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not effective at removing material below the gumline.</li>
            <li> At least the toothbrush lasted longer, 9 months.  </li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> So when an alternative to this awful task became available -</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it leaks from the wimpy filling flap and from the joint where the nozzle stem attaches to the device.</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t so you awkwardly respond like you actually do sometimes cycle.</li>
            <li> I took it to my dentist for opinion who checked to see if water and air were actually forced through the interproximal surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Any firm that does not stand behind their products is not to be trusted.  </li>
            <li> It was fast, efficient, wasn&#x27;t as annoying as dental floss.  </li>
            <li> it is way too slow</li>
            <li> Each was fully charged before the failure, so</li>
            <li> This is not a mechanical failure with the air pump.  </li>
            <li> It allows cleaning below the gum line which is difficult to do with conventional flossers.</li>
            <li> Replacement of the battery is expensive and it&#x27;s not economically worth replacing.</li>
            <li> It holds a very small amount of water, maybe 2 tablespoons, and the burst of air and water that comes when</li>
            <li> A Waterpik can even remove something like a piece of popcorn hull from under your gums.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is very small; 1 1/2 teaspoons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is serious about taking care of his or her teeth.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> so It is impossible for me to use regular floss sting.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous...</li>
            <li> I should have taken the reviews seriously before I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they then fail to produce a product that will last.  </li>
            <li> Six months is a very poor return for such an expensive piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> A little uncomfortable on days my sensitivess acts up.</li>
            <li> The automatic burst is also a little bit silly -</li>
            <li> Bad: If you plan to replace regular flossing with this, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This is not fair business practice.  </li>
            <li> Not a good design.  </li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, it does splash somewhat, so I just hold a washcloth to my mouth when using it.  </li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> His dentist constantly lectured him on flossing and his cleanings were always painful from all the scraping.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying, merely a toy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unit is not easy to use - difficult to &#x27;feel&#x27; when the tip is in the gap between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like because I am tired of filling the very small reservoir up with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product is poorly made, constantly having to call the company for replacement.  </li>
            <li> First off, it was awful even when it did work.</li>
            <li> Even for teeth with tight contacts it gets into that little space at the base of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with Amazon either.</li>
            <li> Problem is that the switch and/or the pump are poorly designed.</li>
            <li> And the base unit only comes with one nozzle.</li>
            <li> I did not get this through Amazon, I actually got it through my dentist because they noticed that I truly hate flossing.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it to floss behind your teeth or anywhere but</li>
            <li> have a permanent retainer cemented in behind my lower teeth</li>
            <li> and I thought maybe this unit would be beneficial in trying to get food particles out of the spaces behind the wire.  </li>
            <li> However, this product just did not win me over.  </li>
            <li> However, this product just did not win me over.  </li>
            <li> I had broken hers by accident and this was the exact-same model.</li>
            <li> What makes matters even worse is that when I called Philips to get a replacement they asked if I ever used mouthwash in the unit.  </li>
            <li> Execution is poor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service is poor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product if you want to save time or hate traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> That suggestion proved worthless, as I couldn&#x27;t send email to their site, nor could I &amp;#34;chat,&amp;#34; although I made several attempts.  </li>
            <li> An air-flosser was recommended by a dental hygienist when I complained that conventional flossing was difficult and even painful for me because of an arthritic hand and shoulder.  </li>
            <li> The so-called automatic pulses have an unnecessary pause between them, and they hit the teeth like a little hammer with an unpleasant amount of force.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Folks, this product has a SERIOUS design defect as one, maybe two can fail but FOUR!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is awkward to use and I consider it no more value than a toy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working after 5 weeks of intermittent use.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Anyone who thinks this is expensive hasnt been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The braces make it so difficult to floss.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say it&#x27;s a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> I thought I might have been reading the instructions wrong, but that wasn’t the case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to floss when you have braces.</li>
            <li> But the airfloss mechanism is flawed.  </li>
            <li> I also have permanent retainer wires that can be difficult to floss around</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, if I had read that I would not have known that was alcohol.</li>
            <li> By that time I&#x27;d thrown away the box and info so was unable to return.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately some of water does spray out on the mirror.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They keep asking questions why it fails</li>
            <li> Only in a cardboard box, and was dirty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Using dental floss was difficult with my arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM FAILED AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE.</li>
            <li> I failed to keep the packaging and the paper work.</li>
            <li> It works well, but not perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fossing is really difficult and time consuming with the wires.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about these contraptions</li>
            <li> and now I am just stuck with a useless bit of technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry for the dentist speak, but</li>
            <li> We have had three of these fail.  </li>
            <li> One we had replaced under warranty and the replacement failed within a year.  </li>
            <li> Using floss by hand was so difficult with the impaired use of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We bought this for my son when he got braces because flossing is difficult.</li>
            <li> I think that there was something wrong with the battery.</li>
            <li> I informed them again it&#x27;s split in two and useless.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing because so messy</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there seems to be nothing else on the market that competes with the Airfloss</li>
            <li> UNIT FAILED 4</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but my dentist recommended it</li>
            <li> IT WA S VERY FRUSTRATING.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> It is also nearly impossible to fill without spilling, and I don&#x27;t have shaky hands!</li>
            <li> I can floss and still feel food between my teeth, which drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> As a person who lives on a budget I feel frustrated with a product and a  corporation that has wrong myself and others with a malfunctioning product.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would explode.</li>
            <li> It has to be refilled a lot and it seems to leak from the reservoir, that drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> I like the unit, just unhappy with</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing product even when it did function.</li>
            <li> I hope the TWO kids electric toothbrushes by Sonicare don&#x27;t fail too!  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed with how useless this was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality; however, I skeptical about the quality of the AirFlosser received and really disappointed with Philips Customer Service.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality; however, I skeptical about the quality of the AirFlosser received and really disappointed with Philips Customer Service.  </li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s orthodontist recommended this for her as an alternative to very tedious flossing around her braces.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Impossible to</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so mad and disappointed in this product that I have to prevent someone else from purchasing.</li>
            <li> Bad i need to say i never know if i have the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just use it if I eat something that gives me bad breath like garlic.  </li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with a non working flooser and no recoursr for a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flosses badly.</li>
            <li> This makes flossing a painful</li>
            <li> And when I pushed the button, I was shocked by the pop of the spring and the water shooting out in a forceful stream.  </li>
            <li> I get a cleaning every 3 months because of gingivitis and it is always painful.</li>
            <li> If I miss my teeth and hit my tongue, it is painful.</li>
            <li> Painful and unreliable.</li>
            <li> This always drives me mad as I hate having bits stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> People who are using this tool as a replacement for floss might be a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> WAS DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t feel its equal to flossing, so I use this in the mornings and floss at night.</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my teeth, so my gum will bleed if i use this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this saved my gums from surgery. The told me I would have to have the scraping done and I didn&#x27;t want that.  So, I got one of these and did and do it every night.  It works if you are consistent. Put warm water and a little Listerine in there and my gums are in the best shape  of their lives. My hygienist is amazed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Had one before but wore it out and knew I just had to get another.</li>
            <li> Seems to the job, but have not used it long enough to know how well it works.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for 2 months</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it. I thought it could take out the dirt between teeth. It can&#x27;t. It just spreads water. Not useful.</li>
            <li> It only works for a couple of years and then you need to purchase another.</li>
            <li> If hard to floss with own hands, Philips Sonicare is a great substitute.</li>
            <li> Bought this first for myself and husband...then bought them as gifts for children. Great additional dental care (along with Sonicare brush and regular dental floss).  Better dental exams in just a few months.</li>
            <li> Works great but the reservoir cover broke after a few uses!</li>
            <li> Good, intend to buy more</li>
            <li> my dental hygienist recommended I get it. works fine, but I think it should hold a bit more fluid than it does.</li>
            <li> For those who hate to floss, and you know who I am talking about! This is for you and for me, and my husband, and my daughter! lol! This works wonders.  I don&#x27;t understand what all the complaining was about from some customers, but it is easy to use, and it does not &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; all over the place like some claimed.  I use this twice a day, everyday.  I recommend it! The price is great too!</li>
            <li> Love it, teeth and gums feel amazing everyday!</li>
            <li> Works very well! Might need some time to get used to</li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong because mine needs daily recharging.</li>
            <li> When it works, it works well.  Unfortunately, it stopped working after 5 weeks of intermittent use.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I really like this Sonicare.  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the Water Pik, which I did not like at all.  It&#x27;s not messy, and makes my mouth feel so much cleaner.  I use mouthwash in it instead of plain water.</li>
            <li> My gum disease is completely gone and the pockets are getting smaller so I am buying It for my children as well.</li>
            <li> not convinced it prevent scale build up between teeth</li>
            <li> This is an item that was recommended to be by my dental hygenist.</li>
            <li> Love this.  So much quicker than flossing and mouth feels cleaner.  I told my Hygienist about this new flosser and she may recommend the flosser to others.</li>
            <li> seems to work ok. next check up will tell. not that sure how much the mist cleans.</li>
            <li> This Electric Flosser will not make you dispense the normal dental floss. It doesn&#x27;t completely clean between teeth.</li>
            <li> These days I go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt; Because you were using a toothbrush to go to the dentist before undergoing treatment itneude every week to an implant is used after it came out well not have food stuck between gums.</li>
            <li> Works as expected however it can use more power...</li>
            <li> only wors between teeth...not between inside and outside o gum and teeth...&lt;br /&gt;waterpick type cleaner far superior</li>
            <li> My first time using this Airfloss and I love it,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Works well. Does the job but I wish the water reservoir held more water so that I do not have to keep filling up in the middle of using the product.</li>
            <li> Does not clean as suggested. Far inferior to dental flossing. Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Should be fine no feedback from friend.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after a dental visit, I love this item.  I received it as promised and it work exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> Shape pretty easy to use and quick to clean. Start gums bleed easily. After a few times just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but I&#x27;ve had two of them that stopped working after a few months.  I&#x27;m not hammering nails with it, just flossing my teeth.  Not exactly cheap to begin with, but recommeded by my oral hygienist.  Wish it was more reliable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> IT TOOK A WEEK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT. THE DIRECTIONS NEED CLARIFICATION. BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY BOYFRIEND IT WA S VERY FRUSTRATING.  TO PRIME THE PUMP AND GET IT STARTED WAS THE HARDEST PART...........NEES TO BNE EXPLAINED IN THE BEGINNING!</li>
            <li> Works great...when it works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had it replaced 3 TIMES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the 3rd time is the charm</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other brands, but not as great as expected.</li>
            <li> I love the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]] and have been using it twice a day since it arrived and was fully charged.  I use either water or a combination of water and mouthwash to get between each and every tooth in my mouth, focusing on the areas where I have gold crowns that trap more food than I can believe.  Since I received this electric flosser, I haven&#x27;t needed to use the toothpicks I&#x27;d gotten into the habit of picking with each night after dinner.  I simply fill the reservoir, prime the pump, then proceed.  By keeping the mouth closed, liquid remains in the mouth and I&#x27;ve yet to experience dripping or squirting anywhere.  I use either the automatic repeat action or take my time and press the activating button as I insert the tip between the teeth.  Snapping the tip at first required more force than I&#x27;d anticipated, but I&#x27;ve learned that it really must be snug to work properly, so when I remove it for cleaning, I double check to be sure it&#x27;s firmly seated in the base.  This has been holding a charge for me, but I must add that I really do like to keep it on the base plugged into an outlet, as I&#x27;ve been doing with my Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years.  This device is not intended to take the place of your flossing, it&#x27;s a tool to stimulate the gums using water and force, forcing particles free of the teeth trap.  Together, your dental hygiene will be improved and your digestion will also thank you for keeping the first step of that process in good condition.</li>
            <li> Overall is 2 stars only since after using this product yout will have to do manual floss anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this airflosser. I picked it up when I purchased my Philips Sonicare toothbrush and both of them together brings a very clean mouth! The Airflosser works very well and is quite powerful. So be careful of aiming this towards sensitive gums. I have used it for a very long time before brushing with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I noticed the airflosser would no longer shoot air out of it, so I called up Philips and they immediately sent me a replacement. Very happy with Philips and there teeth cleaning products. Highly recommended and I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Love it !!! works really well. I use ACT mouthwash instead of water. Works great !!!</li>
            <li> it is compact, less messy , less noise, it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I use for one month now, I like it.</li>
            <li> the part that held the mouth wash or water, flew off and cannot be found, it did this before, and i found it, but could not get it securely in place.. i cannot find a place to by the part, i love it otherwise, especially with a fixed retainer wire...,,,,</li>
            <li> The Philips Airfloss Electric Flosser has a good amount of power to blast through and clean under the gumline. HOWEVER, it does not have enough power to dislodge food particles between teeth. You would still need to use traditional dental floss to clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the Philips Airfloss is STILL a very useful tool for helping you maintain healthy teeth and gum -- when it&#x27;s used as PART of a dental care regime like using mouthwash, brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily (with traditional floss), and visiting your dentist for checkup/cleaning every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star off because it will not replace traditional flossing (since it&#x27;s marketed as a \\&quot;flosser,\\&quot; I expect it to replace traditional flossing as an equally effective way of flossing your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative to the Philips is the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but according to some reviewers, it DOES do at least as good a job as traditional flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll conclude with a final word for people who are not flossing regularly: One way to encourage yourself to floss at least once daily is to use colored floss (Johnson and Johnson Reach makes a waxed mint floss that&#x27;s green in color). Colored floss helps you see plaque build-up much better than floss that&#x27;s colored white. Once you see the plaque that comes off between your teeth every day, you will WANT to floss every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict On The Philips Sonicare Airfloss Electric Flosser: Recommended with reservations.</li>
            <li> Anyone who thinks this is expensive hasnt been to the dentist. I bought this at the recommendation of my hygenist. It pays dividends almost immediately. Lets be honest most people dont floss daily. I&#x27;ve used the waterpik and it&#x27;s messy and oversprays.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect. You fill it up and it sprays a shot of air and water(or mouthwash).</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it after every meal.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and doesn&#x27;t feel good in the mouth. Don&#x27;t seam to be cleaning between the teeth very well. Should have bought WaterPik</li>
            <li> Even my dentist recomends this!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Airfloss a few weeks ago and I now enjoy flossing. My dental hygienist was insistent that I needed to improve my flossing regimen and now I floss every evening. The automatic 1-second feature moves the process along and no messy water or mouthwash shooting out all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> i hate flossing, but this is great and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I suffer from the kind of terminal laziness that most of us non-flossers have, and this product has been a wonderful solution. I use water rather than mouthwash, preferring to swish some mouthwash around following flossing, and I have noticed a significant change in my overall oral sensitivity and the infrequent bleeding I used to experience when flossing has gone away completely. Although it is a little messy at first, at the worst it resulted in drops on the counter and mirror, and I have since learned to use it with very minimal splash back. The reservoir holds more than enough water for my entire mouth and I have had zero issues with the function of the product after daily use for several weeks. Many people complain about how this is not as good as using string floss, and I would agree that if you have a particle of food stuck between your teeth above the gum line, using regular floss to remove it might be a better solution, but this product is absolutely perfect for me and has made a huge difference already, despite having only been used for a short time. I have several close-set and overlapping teeth, but have found it to work even in those instances.  I think the greatest benefit for me, however, has been that the simplicity has allowed me, despite my resistance to flossing, to get into a positive routine. Sure, you might say I should have just bucked up and been responsible about flossing in the first place, and that&#x27;s true, but this product has been more pleasant and significantly easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and has made me a daily flosser. I definitely recommend this to anyone with oral sensitivity, and those who do not regularly floss.</li>
            <li> Stopped working only a few months after it arrived.</li>
            <li> Have just gotten my second one. Returned the first because there was a small gap between the head and the body of the unit causing it to lose pressure and spray water all over my chest. The second unit has the exact same problem. I am unsure if it is defective or a design flaw but this honestly makes me hate the product.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and we&#x27;ll likely purchase another.</li>
            <li> This device doesn&#x27;t hold up in comparison to WaterJet, WaterPik, etc.  This holds only a bit of water which doesn&#x27;t hold much force when ejected with air between teeth along with a thump against the teeth..  I took it to my dentist for opinion who checked to see if water and air were actually forced through the interproximal surfaces.  Hard to tell....I needed someone else to see because it doesn&#x27;t dislodge food particles if you  have a place that collects.  The only use I can see for this might be a bed bound person who can&#x27;t lean over a sink.</li>
            <li> Just as my Dr. recommended. Great choice.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation. Wish the reservoir had a larger capacity.</li>
            <li> People who are using this tool as a replacement for floss might be a bit disappointed.  But as a suppliment to daily flossing this unit works great.  After meals, a quick &amp;#34;go-around&amp;#34; with this flosser really works nice.  For people with bridgework, I would think a tool like this would be indispensable.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now and I have had no leaks or other problems.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, I was expecting a little bit more from Sonicare but this product just don&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Bad i need to say i never know if i have the toothbrush how this things will do sth well buy a new toy</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, you WILL spray the bathroom mirror by accident. It shoot a puff of mouthwash between your teeth- and it is very effective. I fill it with a non-alcohol mouthwash and it is great. I no longer plan on flossing twice a day. This is far more fun.</li>
            <li> Noticible difference in my gums. I had trouble flossing because my mouth is small and it was just a pain to do. My husband has even started using it. I have not missed a day using since I purchased it because it is so easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teeth nut.  I can floss and still feel food between my teeth, which drives me crazy.  The Philips Sonicare blasts those food particles OUT!  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is serious about taking care of his or her teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill. Works great.</li>
            <li> still works. after a while of having it. nothing really special. I use it to clean around my implants, which I have two. The dentist says they could see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product,but my first one only workeD for 3 years.</li>
            <li> The air floss electric flosser is easy to handle and a refreshing experience each day to maintain ones dental needs.</li>
            <li> purchased 3 two for replacement. item works on three modes for a bit of time then automatically  shoots at level one. cant get it back to triple or double burst.  sent all back for replacements from Sonicare, one more try!</li>
            <li> Our dentist likes this product, and we do, too.  Would be even better if there were a way to adjust the water pressure.  It&#x27;s a little too high for healing gums.  Also, it is not effective at removing material below the gumline.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.  My 10 year old sons orthodontist suggested the item to help with hard to floss areas with braces.  It stopped working after less than 3 weeks.  I get online a week later to get it exchanged. Nope. Can&#x27;t do it.  I hope the TWO kids electric toothbrushes by Sonicare don&#x27;t fail too!  I will make sure my orthodontist does not recommend this product again.  Not happy with Amazon either. Will rethink my Prime membership.</li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips Sonicare flosser at Costco and was expecting something more like a water jet. I was so disappointed with the one second burst of a drip of water mixed with a burst of air every few seconds. I paid $119.00 before the $20.00 rebate and feel as though I just threw my money away. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a flosser for lazy people. That&#x27;s the only way I can think of to describe it to you. If you are too busy or lazy to go to the trouble of manually flossing your teeth, you can at least use this Airfloss devise to attempt to blast icky build-up out from between your teeth using water. The results? Well, some stuff will definitely be dislodged by this, but not all. You cannot even compare the results to what you get when you actually floss the old-fashioned way. My mouth didn&#x27;t feel super clean after using this. In fairness, I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about dental hygiene. Still, I think this Airfloss is best reserved for those people who will not EVER floss, and therefore they may get some benefit from using this. For the rest of us, though, I suggest flossing with ACTUAL floss!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful handheld electronic device. It is powerful enough to fire the plastic nozzle 5 feet through the air if it is not seated properly and snapped into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a cracked tooth. After using this device for about a week the pain in my tooth went away. I think it was because enough plaque had been removed from surrounding teeth and the pressure on the cracked tooth was lessened. This was plaque that flossing didn&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir in the handle is a little small. It runs out of water before I&#x27;m able to cover the front and the back of all my teeth. it takes 3 or 4 presses of the trigger button before the flosser is primed and starts to shoot water again. It may take more than 30 seconds to use this device on your entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle does not fit tightly in the charger. The power indicator light does not flash indicating either that the unit is charging or fully charged. I&#x27;m not able to tell whether or not the charger is working. The charge lasts me longer than the 14 days it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped my flosser once and the nozzle broke in two. Normally I  would throw away a broken \\&quot;electronic toy.\\&quot; But this is not a toy. It really works. I&#x27;m buying replacement nozzles asap.</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to use. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Less effective than water floss.</li>
            <li> needs bigger container for fluids.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one, because mine died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> It needs to be able to hold more mouthwash.  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like because I am tired of filling the very small reservoir up with mouthwash. It is also nearly impossible to fill without spilling, and I don&#x27;t have shaky hands!</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying I have been using Philips electric toothbrushes for years and I love them. When I saw this flosser, I jumped on it. Quality of Philips&#x27; products can&#x27;t be beat, and I can honestly say the flosser is incredible. I absolutely hate flossing and this electric flosser makes what could be a burdensome chore, fun and quick. My teeth have never felt so clean and my mouth so fresh since I have been using it for the last 2+ weeks. I have made the use of this flosser part of my everyday evening routine and my gums look wonderful (they did do some bleeding at first but most of that has stopped with continued use). I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare flosser for everyone. Would make a great Christmas present!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. The is my second one. (I accidentally dropped the first and broke it after 2 years). After brushing I use this with mouthwash.  It really does get and food particles out from between the teeth.  Although I occasionally use the traditional dental floss, I prefer this and use it about 75% of the time.  My dentist agrees this is a great tool, I have no issues with my gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I have problems with gum disease and with getting food stuck between my teeth, and this works great.  If my gums are swollen, flossing sometimes hurts, and I know it doesn&#x27;t get everything that&#x27;s stuck between my teeth.  Using this is less painful and more effective.  In fact, it feels so good that I look forward to using it!!  I like using mouthwash in the reservoir, but water is effective too.</li>
            <li> Love this as an alternative to regular flossing! Recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Works good but could use a little more horse power.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well. Would have returned, but had been out of town and waited to long to open. Was supposed to come with additional heads, but did not. Disappointed in this product. Also does NOT hold charge!</li>
            <li> Love it really gets between the teeth highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have used a WaterPik for a long time and thought this would be a portable version of something similar.  I was mostly incorrect about that.  This product creates a &#x27;mist&#x27; of mostly air and some water/mouthwash that puffs between your teeth.  I am sure it is effective, but compared to the WaterPik I am used to using it is slow and ineffecient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 24 hours to charge prior to use, per the instructions.  After that, it stays charged for a couple weeks.  I used it daily and it seems to work as described.  The sensation of mist and air blowing between my teeth was odd, but Im sure it is a personal preference of mine and not a universal feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 settings, one manually sends a burst and the other sends a pulsing burst.  Both seem fairly slow to me and it seems to take a long time to get through the process between each tooth.  Again, this is coming from my already being used to a different type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is well designed and works as described. My problem is that I did not like the feeling of its use, the process seems to take a long time to finish, and I still prefer using the WaterPik over this product.</li>
            <li> I am, pleased with this product so easy to use. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Had two of mine break and is still under warranty. Took many, many phone calls to get a replacement unit. When it works it works great.</li>
            <li> Would give it 0 stars if i could. I was given 2 as gifts. The first one broke after 3 months, and the second broke after 5 months. We used them on average 3x per week. Just buy floss and use it. much cheaper and takes about as long. Since they were gifts, they arent covered under warranty. Not worth the hassle even</li>
            <li> A bit skeptical at first.  But it seems to be working.  Let you know after my next cleaning.  A little uncomfortable on days my sensitivess acts up.</li>
            <li> I bought one. For one month I used it and found it jarring and loud. It feels like it&#x27;s going to break you teeth. Then it stopped working.  I called Philips and after wading through the automated phone maze I talked to someone who promised to send me a replacement.  It never arrived. So I&#x27;m out $100. Way to steal my hard-earned money, Philips.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if it works! I&#x27;ve even gotten positive remarks from my dentist. Problem is that the switch and/or the pump are poorly designed. I bought two and had to return both to Phillips after approximately  6 months of daily use.  The two replacements also failed within the same timeframe.  I just wished it would work, because it is very convenient and effective.  I would even go so far as to say that Phillips is overly optimistic with their two year warranty!</li>
            <li> The Flosser does a great job at what it was designed to do.  It gets into the spaces between teeth and above a tight fitting bridge that was impossible to clean under any other way.  I usually load it with Listerine mouthwash and haven&#x27;t had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself could use a couple of design improvements however.  The surface could use strip of rubberized gripper similar to my Sonicare toothbrush. It isn&#x27;t slick but it isn&#x27;t really easy to hold with damp hands either. The reservior could be silghtly larger and easier to fill.  One reason the surface gets a little slippery is because I tend to get a couple of drips on the handle while filling. Not a major issue but perhaps this will be fixed in a later model.</li>
            <li> I wish I had checked with my dentist before getting the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]], since counterspace is limited and I don&#x27;t like the look of dangling cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box advertises the air flosser \\&quot;removes up to 5x more plaque between teeth\\&quot; - but the tiny print at the bottom indicates that the comparison is between the air flosser and brushing your teeth, not the air flosser and traditional floss.  My dentist said that traditional floss is much more effective and discouraged me from switching to the air flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t bring yourself to use traditional floss, this is worth considering.  As for me, I&#x27;ll stick to [[ASIN:B001FWXSBU Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Cool Mint Flavor Floss 40 M (Pack of 6)]] which takes up hardly any space in the drawer and is easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy the air flosser, please note that only one head is included. You may want to purchase [[ASIN:B0052JNCFE Philips Sonicare HX8002/60 Airfloss Replacement Nozzles, 2-Pack]] if more than one person in your household will be using it.  Philips recommends replacing the head every six months.</li>
            <li> The air flosser I originally got from Phillips stopped working after I had it for only a couple of months. I contacted Phillips and they sent me a unit to replace the one that didn&#x27;t work.  Guess what?  The new unit stopped working as well, after several weeks.  It just seems dead and doesn&#x27;t respond at all when I press the button.  I thought again that it needed to be charged, so charged it for 2 days.  Still no action.  It is just dead.  I called them again and they will not replace it because the original unit was purchased more than 3 months ago.  The fact that it had to be replaced and the replacement does not work makes no difference. They only go by the original purchase.  This is not fair business practice.  I am out the cost for an item that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Did the job alright but stopped working after 40 days, will try a replacement for a second chance but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I went to use my Airfloss as usual this morning only to find&lt;br /&gt;that it wasn&#x27;t working properly - there was no pressure from&lt;br /&gt;the nozzle.  When I checked, the stem of nozzle itself had come&lt;br /&gt;apart and split down the middle starting at the base.  Examining it&lt;br /&gt;(and a new nozzle) more closely, it seems that it is glued together&lt;br /&gt;along the entire length and this is what split apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not abuse the nozzle (never been dropped, bumped, etc), and&lt;br /&gt;I have been the only one to use it (gently).  I use it with mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;m wondering if the seam was defective or the mouth wash&lt;br /&gt;weakened the glue.  Either way it split and is useless…  Despite the&lt;br /&gt;fact that the literature with the device suggests changing the nozzle&lt;br /&gt;every 6 months… hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the replacement tip lasts (I&#x27;ll be watching this&lt;br /&gt;very closely)</li>
            <li> Battery failed after only 3 months and can&#x27;t get any help from Philips Australia.Philips is not a name for quality any more.</li>
            <li> When I first received my Philips Sonicare HX8211/30 Airfloss, I loved the feeling of truly clean healed gums I was experiencing flossing with water. A month and a half after receiving this product the hard plastic piece used to hold water in the reservoir is not working. This piece of hard plastic used as a door to be opened and closed on the reservoir is not doing it&#x27;s job. It has worn down with only flossing two times a day. The water leaks and the plastic doesn&#x27;t stay in place. Phillips should use a soft rubber as a plug instead of hard plastic. Once the plastic doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s airtight position, it no longer succeeds in flossing with water. Each time use my Philips Sonicare Airfloss, I have to hold the plastic component in place. This isn&#x27;t right to do to us consumers. I regret filling out a return policy on this product but I didn&#x27;t think I would have to with a name like Philips Sonicare in front of this product. As a person who lives on a budget I feel frustrated with a product and a  corporation that has wrong myself and others with a malfunctioning product.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting concept that is not yet fully optimized.  I have been using the item for about 2 months and the nozzle cracked without warning or any trauma.  Guess it can&#x27;t take the pressure of the liquid being pumped out of it.  And considering the fact that these nozzles cost a small fortune ($9.50 a piece for something that likely costs about 50 cents to manufacture!) one would hope they would not fail so quickly.  Philips says that they should be replaced every 6 months, so that implies they should last that long.  Mine didn&#x27;t come close. And the base unit only comes with one nozzle. Further, I found that the activator button some times got stuck.  This product doesn&#x27;t really replace the need for string flossing.  So over all, I can&#x27;t recommend this, and I don&#x27;t think I will invest another $20 bucks for 2 replacement nozzles to continue to use it.  Frankly, this experience has lowered my opinion of Philips products which I used to think were of great quality and worth the premium price. Update: I called Sonicare and learned that they do not warrant their nozzles, so beware.  I found other posts on Sonicare&#x27;s own web site that reported similar nozzle failures.  Any firm that does not stand behind their products is not to be trusted.  I&#x27;m lowering my rating from 2 stars to 1.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and the flosser really is too powerful and makes my gums bleed and hurt.It would probably be fine for others but not for my sensitive mouth.It was recommended by my hygentist</li>
            <li> You can NOT use mouthwash that contains alcohol in the Sonicare AirFloss!  Use peroxide rinse or Listerine Zero instead of regular mouthwash.  The alcohol corrodes the internal workings rendering it useless. (I know because I ruined 2 before I found out why).  I really like the AirFloss.  I always used string floss until I got braces.  The braces make it so difficult to floss.  The AirFloss works really well.  I will continue to use it after the braces come off in addition to the string floss.  I have had my regular check-ups and cleanings and my gums are in great condition and no bleeding, so it is working quite well.  If you don&#x27;t string floss at all you really must get this. The reservoir is a little small and the cover over it is a little flimsy, but it is worth being careful not to have a big Waterpic on the counter.  This is small and very convenient.  Very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely prefer it to dental floss and all the other different little tools used to clean the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, it works well. Need to learn how to use it, but it does the job once you get the hang of it. No problem with battery as mentioned in other posts, after 6 weeks of use. However, I do not keep it on the charger at all times.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for me although I do have a regular waterpik already. I normally brush, floss and use the pick, then mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do the same instead I put Listerine in the fluid compartment, less than a cupful and use as directed. The difference is great.&lt;br /&gt;I can do it with just air or with Listerine as recommended. It is incredible, my mouth and teeth feel so clean. The children love it and do it&lt;br /&gt;themselves. Highly recommended. I purchased a second one for my suitcase for my travels.</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s orthodontist recommended this for her as an alternative to very tedious flossing around her braces. We were told that a water pik was too forceful and could hurt her gums. The unit did a great job for 6 months until stopped working. It would turn on, but pushing the pulse button would shut it down totally. If you held the power button on it would work, but you can&#x27;t really use it with both hands. :/ hopefully we can replace it under warranty.</li>
            <li> Quality of floss with this machine is not probably on par with traditional flossers, but this is very fast and comfortable to use so I love it!</li>
            <li> Flossing is usually a chore so I tend to miss it out. The Philips Flosser is quick and easy to use and is very effective. Using mouthwash freshens your mouth, too. I recommend it to everyone who dislikes flossing the conventional way.</li>
            <li> After a bout with gum disease my dentist recommended this and I&#x27;m sorry to say it&#x27;s a piece of junk.  After just a few months the plastic casing is cracked in several places, the water chamber is gunky funky but resistant to cleaning, and the bursts of air/water are significantly weaker.  I have never droopped it and recharge it faithfully.  Back to additional rounds of regular flossing for me.</li>
            <li> works even better than I had hoped.  Easy &amp; Uber efficient.</li>
            <li> overpriced but does what it say it does and having just spent $1000 dollars having molars and wisdoms extracted it might be worth it, I just use the mouthwash in it and not my hard water which would probably clog it quickly (alternately use  distilled water)and close your mouth or it&#x27;ll spray ya o the rebound</li>
            <li> i got this item from my orthodontist&#x27;s office, after i done with Invisalign, doctor had glued fixed retention to the back of my front teeth. So they sold me this airfloss afterwards and told me &amp;#34;brush first with toothpaste, then use it.&amp;#34;  back home I tried couple of times first, it didn&#x27;t really work for various reasons... but when i read the booklet careful again, I realized that i need to push the water button 6 times, until the actual water shooting out, not only the air pressure shooting out. When the water truly shooting out, it hits my palm pretty strongly! So then I push the head right in between teeth and push the button, a lot of things came out, yay! wonderful! No dental floss any more, never like those scary strings, waxed or no wax, never liked them, but the unwaxed version is good for cutting cakes i read somewhere else. Good buy (although $10 more than buying at amazon), good cleaning tool for me and my husband!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used water flossers before, and my primary gripe about them is the water tank. Either you have a water tank with lots of water that allows you to complete the job, or you have one of the smaller versions that requires you to fill it a few times before you are done. What&#x27;s nice about this air flosser is even though it does use water, or even mouth wash, it does not use large amounts. I was able to floss everything in one go. It&#x27;s light, extremely easy to use although it took quite a bit of pressure to connect the head to the handle unit. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about this is the base it sits on. It just feels loose and a little weird like it shouldn&#x27;t work... but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the unit. It&#x27;s a little on the large side to hold but it&#x27;s quick and easy to maneuver. I would buy one once this breaks. I floss more often now because of ease of use and little fuss to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Does not hold enough liquid and does a mediocre job but, three stars for being better than nothing.  One more item to decorate your bathroom.</li>
            <li> great product -- does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too..</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t clean between teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as advertised, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell what real good it does. It certainly is no substitute for flossing to remove stubborn food particles.  And the reservoir is way too small -- it is good for about two uses before it has to be refilled.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and very effective.  I&#x27;m going to order another one for my son.</li>
            <li> Throw your floss wire away!</li>
            <li> Like most people, I don’t floss nearly as much as I should, especially since I have poor gums.  I know it doesn’t take long, but the laziness factor kicks it at night before bed.  So I was eager to try out this Sonicare Airfloss flosser.  I have used Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and had positive experiences with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to assemble- you just need to connect the head, and charge it.  It’s about the same size of a high-end sonic toothbrush.  You can fill the reservoir with mouthwash, and it lasts about 3 times before you have to refill it.  The directions are simple- you turn the power on, and then put the Airfloss in between your teeth right at the gum.  You push the trigger button and it pushes the air right in.  There is no pain, and the whole experience is over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn’t work well for me.  I always get bleeding gums with traditional floss, yet I never had any bleeding using this flosser.  So that alone tells me it’s not doing a capable job.  I thought I might have been reading the instructions wrong, but that wasn’t the case.  Also, my teeth did not feel clean after using it (other than the fresh clean of the mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve read other reviews and apparently this flosser works well depending on how much space there is in between your teeth.  So it might work for others, but I won’t be using it anymore.  On the bright side, it has pushed me back into traditional flossing on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect especially if you want a fresh mouth and have healthy gums. Flossing is so important to keep you teeth and gums in great shape and having the Sonicare Airflosser is perfect because it gets the job done and it feels great doing the job. In my family we don&#x27;t get cavities but we have Gingivitis and it&#x27;s very important that we keep our gums healthy or we will lose teeth and the Philips Sonicare Airfloss is doing a great job helping us maintain healthier gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the Airfloss because it doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore to do and the kids love having fun doing this without knowing all the benefits they are receiving.</li>
            <li> I have a Waterpik product that is similar in looks but completely different.  the reason I wanted this philips airfloss is because i thought it would be an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik uses high pressure water to remove particles and plaque and does that very well yet has a cheap battery that dies very fast and annoying  charging method.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Philips will have the same idea but with lithium power and the amazing sonicare charging cradle which i can use for both my sonicare tooth brush and the airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;The way the Airfloss works is by single pulses of very little mist and mostly air which does not come close in my opinion to the effective Waterpik way.&lt;br /&gt;I might just end up buying the electric Waterpik as i am amazed with how it works.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN feeling&lt;br /&gt;Use mouthwash in reservoir&lt;br /&gt;Nice ADDITION to dental routine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT REPLACE REGULAR FLOSS&lt;br /&gt;Messy, tricky to get used to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because I have been wanting a water pick for a while (and probably because I had a coupon) and I liked the small size and wireless option.  My first try with the Airfloss was a little messy--TIP: make sure your mouth is closed all the way around the end BEFORE you press the button, otherwise you will need some Windex to clean the spray off your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a LONG time! I charge mine about once per month.  I am the only one who uses it and I probably use it six out of seven days per week.  And it does not take very long to charge, maybe only an hour or two (not like my Clarisonic....takes forerver!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two buttons--a main power button and the button to activate the air/water pulse.  Then there are two speed options once the device is turned on.  You can either press the pulse button intermittently to activate the spray as needed, or hold it down to activate a spray every one second.  I have found the first option works best.  You have to keep your mouth closed so you cannot see where the end of the tool is inside your mouth, so sometimes it takes longer than one second for me to get situate between each groove of my teeth--and sometimes it takes me less, or else I stop at a tooth where I like to get an extra spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white body is where you can fill it with water or, per the instruction manual, mouthwash! This is what probably makes the tool four stars for me instead of two.  I use an ACT fluoride rinse AFTER I have already flossed with regular floss and my mouth feels almost like getting a cleaning from the dentist.  I have tried Airflossing alone, regular flossing followed by Airfloss, and Airfloss followed by regular floss.  I can attest to the fact that--despite the packaging on this MISLEADING product, it DOES NOT REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING. My dentist agrees.  This is why I give the product four stars instead of five.  I am tempted to give it 3 just because I think it is such terrible marketing taking advantage of lazy people, but I enjoy the product IN ADDITION TO MY REGULAR FLOSS that I am sticking with four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are like me and get four cleanings a year from your dentist and LOVE having a clean mouth, floss every day and want that EXTRA clean feeling--then this is a great product for you.  If you are just lazy and want some cool gadget that will floss for you, then either go and spend 2 million dollars and buy a robot to floss your teeth, or just spend $2 at CVS and buy some floss instead of $80 here because that $2 will go a lot further in the long run from saving you from gum disease...not to mention heart disease--&gt;[...]the packaging on this MISLEADING product, it DOES NOT REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING.

            <li> I love this product.  In a short amount of time there is a complete different in my oral health.  Phillips is true to its brand</li>
            <li> Works better than i expected. Helped my dental hygiene a lot as im one of the lazy people who would rather do 100 push up than flossing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterjet &amp; air blast are strong, i sometimes wonder whether the blast grind off my teeth after many years of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life. Use it once daily and it lasts more than a week after each charge.</li>
            <li> On one hand the Sonicare Flosser has done a great job while it is working, removing popcorn from between my teeth for example.  However, I&#x27;m on my third unit in less than 18 months, which just failed in the same way. The quality of this unit is not what I have experienced from other Sonicare products.  Each unit failed electronically where it would no longer stay turn on, finally failing permanently.  Each was fully charged before the failure, so I don&#x27;t think it is a battery or charger issue. The unit can not be disassembled to check out why it failed, as I demonstrated after getting my second unit.  This is not a mechanical failure with the air pump.  It its definitely something to do with the electronic control.</li>
            <li> I did not get this through Amazon, I actually got it through my dentist because they noticed that I truly hate flossing.  When I first got it I was dedicated, I used it once to twice a day and I noticed a huge difference.  It was fast, efficient, wasn&#x27;t as annoying as dental floss.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was actually working but then I noticed that my gums did bleed a little bit (I have mostly good gums just certain areas have always bled) so I knew it was working right!  And, I have to add, I loved that I could use mouth wash.  My mouth smelled so much better, it felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to why it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I got my first one through my dentist, I followed all the instructions, and I did not use it as a throwing toy or baseball bat in any way.  Suddenly though, close to a month after having it, I couldn&#x27;t turn off the automatic feature. I hated the automatic feature.  So I went to their website, reported the problem, spoke to someone in the chat thing, and within a week they had sent me a new one!  I thought that was awesome.  I stopped using it as much, probably 4-5 times a weeks, and both always did this thing where they would stop mid squirt and beep at me, then they would work again.  This time it didn&#x27;t work again.  I cleaned it, the battery was fully charged, I don&#x27;t know why it stopped and I tried a few of the troubleshoot things.  It is dead.  I do not see a point in getting another one.  I have now ordered a Waterpik Ultra.  Lets see how that one goes.</li>
            <li> We bought this because my son&#x27;s orthodontist recommended it. It&#x27;s difficult to floss when you have braces. This seems to do the trick. My son puts a little water or mouthwash in it and is able to clean in a matter of minutes. It&#x27;s easy to use and isn&#x27;t as messy as a waterpik.</li>
            <li> great product and price , I love it</li>
            <li> Been using for a month and my teeth are much less sensitive, but I also follow the instructions and floss too.  Sometimes I just use it if I eat something that gives me bad breath like garlic.  With mouthwash it makes your mouth taste fresher and it gets rid of the garlicky residue between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental appliance I have ever owned! Using a waterpic seems like a big deal. Have to stand over the sink, and makes such a mess, but they are great for healthy gum tissue.  The Phillips Sonicare Airfloss is perfect, and it is so easy to use I find that I use it more times a day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now, and my gums are in the healthiest shape ever. This Airflosser is BRILLIANT!!</li>
            <li> I am editing this review because I&#x27;ve had to go through three of these in a year. Original review:  &amp;#34;I have had major gum problems even though I spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning, flossing waterpicking, etc... I did everything I was told and was in constant pain. When I bought this product it was because portable waterpicks are too bulky to hold and I was traveling.  Three days after starting with it my mouth stopped hurting. My gums stopped being inflamed. I use three pulses per tooth. I floss, brush, use the aiirflosser and then go along the gum line with a rubber pick to get the plaque that sticks there. It only takes a few minutes . I&#x27;m very happy with it.&amp;#34;  Okay, that part is true.  But the airfloss mechanism is flawed.  In other words, for one reason or another, it stops working properly after a few months.  I&#x27;ve been through three of these. Last night it suddenly speeded up, and I couldn&#x27;t turn it off. I had to dunk it in water, because the battery was getting so hot I was afraid it would explode. Thank goodness that stopped it.  I&#x27;ve had one just start making a high pitched whine and then do nothing.  This is ridiculous.  I like what it does for my gums. I really hate what it does to my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful and effective as I was hoping it would be.  Still feel as though I need to really floss to acheive a truly clean effect.  Don&#x27;t stand too close to the mirror while using as it will &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; sometimes...</li>
            <li> Fun works great feels cleaner. I don&#x27;t use mouthwashes with it. Good battery one week. Use it once a day</li>
            <li> Wonderful but could be better if it had 2 speeds.  This one is a little harsh for a new user.</li>
            <li> High quality, Quick delivery. Very good</li>
            <li> I bought mine at my dentist&#x27;s office, upon their suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I have severe food allergies which means my gums are sore a lot of the time.  This makes flossing a painful process.&lt;br /&gt;2) I load my Airfloss with Hydrogen Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;3) I go between each tooth on the buccal and lingual sides. I have some small decay on a couple of teeth, so I do it twice on each side there.&lt;br /&gt;4) Generally speaking, I still use floss, but when my gums are extra sore I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought a Sonicare Elite in 2005, and my teeth had never felt cleaner in my life.  My dental cleanings became a breeze.  With my sever food allergies I cannot use toothpaste due to the flavorings, but with the Sonicare Elite toothbrush you would never know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Airfloss in Jan 2014 and my teeth have never felt as clean as they do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the reviews knocking this because you still remove particles from between your teeth with floss - Surprise surprise!  Nothing can replace the manual action of using a small string between your teeth!  Nothing will replace flossing, ever!  But, the Airfloss is certainly an important step to good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the Waterpik.  My wife bought one from her dentist a couple years ago and we never used it.  With my food allergies and regular sore gums I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to deal with that much water in my mouth.  Since I can&#x27;t use tooth paste, I need to use something like Baking Soda and or H202.  I use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik shoots a tiny bit of H2O2 between the tooth after I have flossed and then I keep as much of the peroxide in my mouth and then brush my teeth with my Sonicare Elite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Cleans in between teeth well. Only criticism is that it sprays your chest while you are using it ---an obvious design flaw as the extra water is spraying from the poor fit of the wand and the handle of the device. It&#x27;s worth getting a little wet for healthy gums.</li>
            <li> works really well.  enjoy using it - enough fluid in dispenser for one thorough cleanse great, with a bit of mouth wash leaves mouth feeling ggod</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it does a good job flushing out the food that a brush would miss. It&#x27;s great with mouthwash or water. I use a pre-brush solution like Plax.I recommend it, especially if you have trouble with floss.</li>
            <li> OK, I bought this primarily to take with me when I travel because toting a giant water irrigator is rather difficult.  Like other reviewers I used this, then flossed... it will NOT replace flossing!  I also have permanent retainer wires that can be difficult to floss around so I thought maybe this would help out in that area.  Nope!  You can&#x27;t use it to floss behind your teeth or anywhere but the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is great but the delivery is not.  Even though I closed my lips around the tip it still sprayed water on the mirror/counter.  I was actually worried that I might damage my gums because for one tooth I was accidentally pointing it downward and it hurt quite a bit when it dug under my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, possibly could be used in place of a water irrigator for travel but don&#x27;t expect it to do the job of flossing!  Floss is cheaper and easier to pack so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be sticking with!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, reasonable price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This funny gadget is easy to use and makes it almost fun to floss!  I wonder if it works and will not know until my hygienist sees me again.</li>
            <li> Why does mine spray me all over? Did I get a defective one? My neck gets all wet. It does not feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done either.</li>
            <li> Cleans properly.  Excellent tool. Excellent tool for good oral hygiene.  Would recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their teeth for life.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Electric Flosser&amp;#34; is a modern twist on the old &amp;#34;Waterpics&amp;#34; you might remember from the 70&#x27;s and 80s. The difference is that on this one the water reservoir is in the handle, and instead of constant pulses of water, this one puts out individual pulses about a second apart. You move it from tooth to tooth between blasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have some advantages over the old Waterpics. One is, that since individual blasts are sent once a second, you can position the device, and then receive the single blast of water right between your teeth. As such, there is much less water dribbling out of your mouth, or getting sprayed everywhere, which was my experience with the older devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product pretty much works as advertised, and will deliver a sharp burst of water right between your teeth to help clean between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised, but is it a product I will use . . . probably not. It is one more thing to keep plugged in on your bathroom countertop, and I really do not see the true benefit of the device. If you are someone who already flosses your teeth, you will not like this device because it simply can not do the job that flossing does. No way will a burst of water clean like the physical &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; you get with floss. Second, if you are someone who does not take the time to floss, you will probably not take the time to use this device. I can floss my teeth just as quickly as it takes to get between all the teeth with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I really like sonicare products, and in general believe they make good stuff, but unfortunately I think that this particular device is ill-conceived and probably is not going to be used by many people.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in less than a month.</li>
            <li> feels great with air or water or mouthwash</li>
            <li> works well with mouthwash and water as described. sturdy build, no leaks. My dentist will greatly appreciate how often i floss now (cuz who ever does that, really?)</li>
            <li> I would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Affordable. Sleek and comfortable in the hand and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I am a 6 ft. 5 in. male, and loved the first Sonicare I had.  After two years, it died, and I purchased another.  The height and weight are important, in that I struggle each morning to activate the flosser.  Lotsa pressure and pushing to get it to activate....unlike the first model.  Every time I use it I think about folks who can&#x27;t press as hard as I can on the button that activates the spray.</li>
            <li> This is a innovative idea in some sorts. I filled up the reservoir with mouthwash, and try to put the spout in between teeth and this flosser squirts out with force the mouthwash, and my mouth does feel fresh and renovated. But this cannot replace the manual flossing, where you use a threading construct, that rubs in and around the teeth crevices and goes under the gums. I would suggest sticking with a good electric toothbrush like Philips Sonicare brand, but using the good old manual flossing.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with how useless this was. I have the waterpik unit and it is excellent. I bought this as a travel unit and cannot believe Phillips made something completely ineffective and worthless considering how good the sonic care toothbrush is. The waterpic is half the price and you really feel how effective it is and there is simply no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a star because there is no option for no stars.</li>
            <li> It is just what my husband, who has MS, needed to help with flossing. Easy to use and understand, and effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this Airfloss after first checking out the other electronic flossing devices (water based ones), and decided this one seemed to fit my needs best considering there isnt much involved to get this thing going (no connecting to water lines or filling tanks with water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this because regular flossing can be a pain sometimes, and even more so because someone mentioned that they felt like &#x27;they just walked out the dentist office after a cleaning&#x27; after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I can tell you this thing definitely does not feel as refreshing as when I walk out of my dentist office. Maybe my dentist office is just THAT good. Honestly, my teeth feel more refreshed after using regular floss to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this thing does seem to work and it blasts some mouth wash between your teeth, so that is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I expected more. But I only paid 30 (made an offer on ebay and had some ebay bucks) and it is much faster than regular flossing so I wont complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to mention are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing can get pretty messy. It blasts a good bit of mouthwash or water into your mouth. I had to keep spitting it out. There is a mode that you can hold the button down and it will spray every second so that you can keep going and do your entire mouth in one shot. I dont think that would be possible unless your swallowing the mouth wash. ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon initial set up, I &#x27;thought I had the attachment fully on. But it wasnt and when I pressed the air shot button it flung it across the room. Made sure you press down hard and hear it snap before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful. There are 3 modes when you turn this thing on. It will either shoot 1 air shot, 2 or 3 depending what you set it too. My first time using it, it &#x27;hiccuped&#x27; and shot one, paused, then shot the other 2, and then when i pulled it away from my mouth it shot the 3rd shot.....almost into my eyes. (thank you big nose for the save)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to take the head off after each use and flush it with water. It doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do so so no water is left lingering in there building up some fungal funk. That being said, I wish the base had something you could place the attachment on while it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum. The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses. Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline. And if you dont press it against this area the air will not floss properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still like it and recommend it. But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.t doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do so so no water is left lingering in there building up some fungal funk.

            <li> Neat Idea. It&#x27;s quick but not as thorough as a water pik. I liked it.  Used it when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the mornings.  2 stars because it only lasted about 5 weeks.  Lights up but quit running.  I can&#x27;t return it because I threw the whole thing in the trash.  Went back to a Water Pik.  This is my second Phillips product (had a Sonic Brush too) that quit working and just stopped.  At least the toothbrush lasted longer, 9 months.  Phillips has quite a mark up on their products.  Product failures should not happen when they are so young.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I hate to floss.  If I floss once a week, I am doing well.  As I hate flossing, I was always looking for an easier or more fun way to get the job done.  I was quite partial to the WaterPik until the button on my handle started sticking to the point it was unusable and I just never got around to fixing it.  When I had the opportunity to try the Phillips Sonicare Airfloss, I thought it would be an excellent way to encourage me to “floss”.  After all, I am quite a fan of the Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips Sonicare Airfloss is slightly larger than the Sonicare toothbrush.  The instructions for the unit are quite simple.  Simply fill the reservoir with water or mouthwash, attach the nozzle to the unit, aim the nozzle between your teeth, press the button and you can floss with a stream of compressed air and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the unit over roughly a month.  When I tried to floss with the unit after not flossing for roughly a week, I found the unit was quite ineffective.  It was able to clean between my teeth that had larger gaps, but did a poor job on tighter spaces that were already filled with a bit of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week, I flossed via the conventional method first to start with clean spaces between my teeth and then tried to use the Airfloss daily after that.  The Airfloss did a better job of keeping my teeth clean via this method, but after about 9 or 10 days, I still had to pull out the dental floss again and get the plaque out between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a permanent retainer cemented in behind my lower teeth and I thought maybe this unit would be beneficial in trying to get food particles out of the spaces behind the wire.  While the Airfloss did indeed get food and such out from behind the wire, I found the air/water burst from the unit a bit too powerful given the angle I had to use it and it caused some irritation to my gums.  If I were dealing with braces on the front of my teeth, I have no doubt this could be an excellent way to clean the wires and brackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.  While I would say that using this is better than nothing, I definitely would not completely substitute the Airfloss for flossing.  If you are a weekly flosser like myself, it may be of some benefit if you use this product between flossing.  I do think this would be an excellent tool for someone with braces.  However, this product just did not win me over.  If I had to choose between using the Airfloss and the WaterPik in between my weekly flossing, I would choose the WaterPik every day of the week.  The Airfloss just lacks the versatility of a WaterPik device.his could be an excellent way to clean the wires and brackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After roughly a month of usage, I was less than impressed with this unit.

            <li> This was great for 6 weeks, that&#x27;s how long it lasted. The customer service was not helpful and very arrogant. They told me that I ruined it because I used mouthwash that contained alcohol. I used the quick start guide which said use water or mouthwash, nothing about alcohol. She said I should have read the entire manual before I used it. I asked why they have a Quick Start guide if you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it. She said that is to get you started.Then you should go read the entire manual. SOOO I should get started by reading the quick start guide and using the wrong mouthwash? All they had to do was make a note in the Quick Start guide about non alcohol. On top of that they do not mention alcohol in the manual! It says isopropyl myristate. I&#x27;m sorry, if I had read that I would not have known that was alcohol. Is it, I still have no idea. Needless to say, I have bought my last Philips product. RUN AWAY, your warranty is worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of equipment to keep teeth flossed. This is my second flosser. My only critisism is that the life span is only 2 years for the rechargeable battery. Replacement of the battery is expensive and it&#x27;s not economically worth replacing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item, it does all that the summary says it will do, I have recommended to friends</li>
            <li> Lemon. This product never worked - now it&#x27;s too late to return it. Unfortunately, I was so excited, I ignored the reviews that often, this product doesn&#x27;t work correctly. I am dissappointed as it was orginally recommended by my dentist. He must have gotten the one good one.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Seems to do a good job.  We will see what the dentist says.</li>
            <li> This glossed is better than hand flossing any day. I was really amazed at how well it did. I would recommend this to anyone who has been told to floss!</li>
            <li> This is the answer for those who have trouble with traditional flossing. My dentist highly recommends this product and so do I!,</li>
            <li> Use it every night. Works great. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> waste-- floss not the same thing</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement item for a friend.  I had broken hers by accident and this was the exact-same model.</li>
            <li> I have Parkinsons so It is impossible for me to use regular floss sting. So the Airflosser is the excat anwser to my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Can really see the difference. If you have bad gums this is a must! Not real cheap but how much would u pay to keep your teeth? Im happy with it! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Reliability of this product is terrible!  I&#x27;m on my third Airflosser after the first two just stopped working after a few weeks of use.  What makes matters even worse is that when I called Philips to get a replacement they asked if I ever used mouthwash in the unit.  Which I replied &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; and they then told me my mouthwash contained alcohol which voids the warranty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this unreliable product.</li>
            <li> ok, So, my aunt actually bought me this thing. I have used about 2 sonicare electric toothbrushes in the last ten years, absolutely worth the investment, worth every single penny, and the latest versions DO actually clean better than older versions! This however, is not marksmanship. Though the idea may sound interesting, flossing regularly and using a sonicare, to me, Does the job between the gums, though I still use a manual toothbrush everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A, your gums protrude upward, like a mountain peak in-between your teeth. This thing kinda Spits a powerful infectious blast in between, But I honestly only felt it at the top. After using it, I rinsed my mouth out, sonicared, and reflossed with regular floss and there was still significant Plaque. Ok, So second test, Floss regularly, sonicare, then Airfloss. then rinse with just spit vigorously and see if anything comes out, NOTHING!!!!!. which means regular floss and the sonicare is all you really need. The Airfloss doesn&#x27;t really get deep down in along the sides of the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. They call it &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; Airfloss, which A (again), SONIC means sound and B theres no sound technology in the this like the sonicare, Unless you consider the sound of the Airfloss deploying water in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if a company really wants to sell a product they shouldn&#x27;t really use the name of their better products to affiliated a new line, even though its in the Oral Care category, There is nothing &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; about it. Its like if....oh idk. Apple made a Itouch and initially called it the iPhone Itouch...something like that, you get me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STUPID PRODUCT, also, though not too significant, Feels CHEAP compared to sonicare which is dense, heavy and seamless,  holds just enough water for your one round, it drips (no biggie), and the stand makes it wobbly. Thanks Philips...for nothin</li>
            <li> Dentist appointment doesn&#x27;t lie. I hate flossing, but using this is so easy and convenient. First try, it did hurt, but I was jamming it in between my teeth too much. What&#x27;s really great is that you can fill the reservoir with mouthwash. You will be left with a very minty clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside, make sure the flosshead is one secure or it will fly off. When it flies off, it may land anywhere - like inside your toilet (which is what happened to mine). I recommend buying additional floss heads if you do purchase it - found them super cheap at amazon.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review of the Philips Sonicare Airfloss on the Philips product website.  It was rejected.  I bought this a couple of weeks ago and thought it did a good job - but it only lasted TWO WEEKS.  I contacted Philips support and they said they would be happy to send me a free replacement handle.  But as I reside in Mexico and I bought this on a trip to USA, the cost of shipping would be more than the value of the product.  In my review I objected to the fact that Canadians can use the Philips USA support site, but south of the border, we are not so lucky.  I also pointed out that ALL the reviews on their site said that it didn&#x27;t last long - and neither do the replacements they send.  One gentleman is on his FOURTH unit - and your warranty is not reset every time; it remains the day of original purchase.  I also noticed a sizable number of comments on Amazon about the thing not lasting long.  Perhaps I implied that there was a design flaw in the product - I certainly believe it, so maybe it came across in my review and that is why they rejected it.  There aren&#x27;t very many reviews on the site but they ALL give the product one star.  Customer service has been terrible.  It is the last Philips product I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Have used for one week and can tell the difference already. Very easy &amp; quick to use. Has motivated me to do a better job brushing too. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> tHE NOZZEL DID NOT FIT THE HANDLE SO CALLED THEM SENT ME A MAILER AND I SENT BACK THEY SENT ME NEWER MODEL HANDLE WHICH WORKED AND KNOCKED $15.00 off my card for my trouble.I am also waiting for my $20.00 rebate which takes a while but I should get it. BH</li>
            <li> After having a permanent retainer placed on the back of my teeth from braces later in life, this has allowed me to floss with ease!!!!</li>
            <li> I had two of these.  In the first case, the battery died within 6 months.  The unit was sitting on its charger and used daily.  The second unit arrived DOA, once again due to the battery.  Its a great idea as it is convenient.  Execution is poor.</li>
            <li> This device stopped working about 10 days after I got it.  By that time I&#x27;d thrown away the box and info so was unable to return.  A waste of money.............</li>
            <li> works good, but does not hold very much water. Without the water, the air is not enough to blow particles out of my braces.</li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but it tips over easily when placed on the charger. And it&#x27;s easy to knock over if you leave it standing on a countertop with or without the charger. Within days after getting it, the nozzle broke and I had to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> For the first time, bleeding, big impact</li>
            <li> My teeth feels healthier. I use it once a day, after brushing and flossing my teeth, so it&#x27;s like a double protection. Will give it full stars if the water doesn&#x27;t keep spraying messily (the part where it&#x27;s joint).</li>
            <li> Do you like to floss? No; no you don&#x27;t. Do you like to use a water pike? No; no you don&#x27;t. This is a great alternative. It takes almost no time, using little water, and it does not hurt as you try as you don&#x27;t have to struggle to get it between those close together teeth.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist but the product does not even do as good a job as simply rinsing one&#x27;s mouth.  It&#x27;s a waste of money, counter-space and electricity.  I will try to return it.</li>
            <li> Returned it. Terrible product. Get a waterpic instead</li>
            <li> They say that you should only \\&quot;floss the ones you want to keep.\\&quot; Well, if that&#x27;s the case, then I&#x27;m in trouble. I hate flossing...I always have. However, I know that it&#x27;s important for gum/tooth health, and so I was SUPER excited to see this air floss option. It shoots a burst of air and liquid (either water or mouth wash) at the gum line to help remove plaque. It may not be 100% as effective as flossing, but compared to 0% flossing, this is a definite improvement for my dental health. I really enjoy using it with mouthwash. It leaves my mouth feeling minty clean. The charge lasts a couple of weeks, but you&#x27;ll need to refill the liquid chamber just about every day. Personally, I love this. I&#x27;m pretty sure my dentist will be pleased as well.</li>
            <li> The biggest \\&quot;flaw\\&quot; in this product is that it calls itself a \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; which invites comparison to the outcome you experience when you use conventional floss. This does perform some of the functions of floss, some that it does not, and doesn&#x27;t do some that it does. The main difference is that floss will help remove large bits of food (liked trapped bits of popcorn or chicken) and the documentation on this explicitly says that it is not designed to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this does use a blast of air and water to push food particles from between your teeth. It likely does it in a more uniform and effective way than floss, particularly if you are not a skilled flosser. When I last went to the dentist, I was advised to be sure that I ran the floss up and down both sides of adjacent teeth (that means two passes between each tooth with the floss) and not to just pull it once between them. Most people hate flossing and do it fast and sloppy. If you&#x27;re one of these people, there is a good chance that the Sonicare is going to do more for your oral hygiene than a cursory or poor flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I see this is as not a substitute for using floss, but as an adjunct. This works so fast that you could easily use it 2-3 times a day just before brushing and could add more \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; to your daily routine in this way. I think how close your teeth are will also have an impact on how it works. Mine are uneven - some are tight and some are loosely spaced. It seemed to work okay with all of them, but it&#x27;s hard to know for sure without some pretty close dental examination. I can say that it did blast out bits of coarsely ground black pepper that was between my teeth. If you want to test it, be sure to spit out the water it uses rather than swallow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback that I experience was that, if I held it slightly wrong, the force behind the air and water could sting my tongue a little. Also, it is messy. You&#x27;re supposed to hold your mouth closed a bit to make sure you&#x27;re not drooling it out everywhere, but it is virtually impossible to do this for all of your teeth. So, this is messier than flossing, though almost certainly more sanitary as long as you keep the tip clean.d a bit to make sure you&#x27;re not drooling it out everywhere, but it is virtually impossible to do this for all of your teeth.

            <li> Much better than trying to floss with braces</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and is very easy to use but not better than actually flossing.  But for our kids, this is much better than nothing.  Also, it is much less messy and easier to use than WaterPick sysstems we&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not &amp;#34;Air&amp;#34; floss. You fill it with a bit of water and when you hit the trigger, it blasts a burst of air AND water droplets between your teeth.  Unfortunately some of water does spray out on the mirror.  Minor clean up required.  This is the main reason I&#x27;m not rating it higher.</li>
            <li> Have some gum issues so am trying everything to stop and reverse problem.  Unit is not easy to use - difficult to &#x27;feel&#x27; when the tip is in the gap between your teeth.  Have gone back to the Waterpik for three reasons:  1.  Since it is pulsing all the time, you do not need it perfectly aligned with the gap between your teeth; just move it along your teeth at the gum line.  2.  In addition to removing material between the teeth, the Waterpik also massages the gums.  3.  Finally, you can use the Waterpik both on the outside and inside of your teeth.  I like the Waterpik unit that has control over the intensity (0-10 dial).</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product, as electric toothbrushes have been around for a while, but an electric flosser is pretty new. You have to charge it for 24 hrs before first use, and wait for the indicator light to turn green. A fully charged flosser lasts about two weeks before the next charge. If its low on charge, the light turns yellow. To fill it with water or mouthwash, you attach the nozzle, filling the reservoir, which holds enough liquid for 1 or 2 uses. To turn it on you press the power button, and press it a couple of times until it sprays well. To clean your teeth with it, you have to put the tip at the gum line between the teeth and keep moving it to direct spray between the teeth. You can either do the \\&quot;auto-burst\\&quot; function--which menas you hold down the activation button and the spray bursts every second, or you can choose to control the pace yourself and press the \\&quot;single-burst\\&quot; function to release individual bursts. This flosser can only be used on the front outside surface of the teeth. I used it with mouthwash and the single-burst function so that I could control the pace of the bursts, and had a good experience with it. There&#x27;s a lot of freshness afterwards, and I felt that it did a much better job than just brushing or even manual flossing.</li>
            <li> A great flosser.  It works very well and the convenience of having a flosser at hand can&#x27;t be beat.  I now airfloss after eating anything, not just after meals.  I even airfloss just for the massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  Works very well and removes food particles as big as flax seeds or chunks of meat.  Not painful and very much like a gum massage.  Fun to squirt at wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Only four stars because the liquid chamber could be larger and easier to fill.  Note to Philips...have your design team sit on a couch in the living room and fill the Airfloss, that will help them develop a better way to fill the chamber and an appreciation for a larger chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flosser and will never be without one.  It is easy to use and I will buy one for my office and one for the car since the one I have lives in the living room at home.  I still floss with tape, but this is a good quick floss when I can&#x27;t go the whole tape route; at night I even do both...airfloss, then tape.  But the airfloss is a good way to floss anytime, anywhere and is even easy to carry in a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is as thrilled with it as I am.  Especially since she gets to squirt me when she has it.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist recommended this to help with my gum health.  You can use it with or without mouthwash for cleaning between the teeth.  I put mouthwash in the well of the flosser for better cleaning, however it was quite messy, as the pulse type button shoots the liquid between your teeth you get a kickback that wets your whole chest area.  I now put paper towels around my neck to absorb the extra liquid that shoots out of the nozzle.  However, my teeth do feel well clean and gums feel clean, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! My teeth are squeaky clean. I used it with TheraBreath Professional Oral rinse and my mouth feels really clean as well! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser is an another weapon in the arsenal of tooth and gum maintenance products. It allows cleaning below the gum line which is difficult to do with conventional flossers. The real test will be at my next dental visit to see if using the air flosser results in improved gum health and decreases &#x27;pockets&#x27; below the gum line</li>
            <li> If the work they are doing a good job. However the first one died within 6 months the second died yesterday.  Philips did replace my first but the second might be an issue (I will try) as it is 10 days older than 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is poor I had to wait 47 minutes to get to speak to someone and than I was disconnected.  I called the dentist professional line. That picked up within seconds... of course they can&#x27;t help.  I will follow up on this as soon as I know if they will replace it.</li>
            <li> I just received this as a Christmas present and have been wanting one for a long time.  However, I used it this morning and was sorely unimpressed.  It holds a very small amount of water, maybe 2 tablespoons, and the burst of air and water that comes when&lt;br /&gt;you press it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my teeth.  And you can&#x27;t use it in the back of your teeth which is weird.  I&#x27;m returning it to the store.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work because it&#x27;s cordless and has the air in the spurt.  Also, you have to press it every time you want it to&lt;br /&gt;spurt the water and air.  Not a good design.  I have their cordless toothbrush and love it.  But they fell short on this one.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found that this item cleans the teeth just like flossing.  It is so easy and not as time consuming as using the floss thread.  I would recommend this to everyone.  It take a few times to get the hang of it but your mouth will feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> works until it breaks and they replace one of the 2 that come in box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then  the one year warranty period comes up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then it doesnt work and&lt;br /&gt;you cant fix them&lt;br /&gt;they are pieces of Crap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and they dont replace them</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as promised. Happy with the way the product works.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s easier than using dental floss and I&#x27;m much more likely to use on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s more effective than using floss, but you can use with mouthwash and leaves you with a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This does the job very well when it works correctly, but it is very tempermental ands sometimes you have to fiddle with it to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Used a few weeks and feel the food that&#x27;s removed. So I think it&#x27;s a very good purchase. Wish the replacement nozzles were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I looked at one of at Target and then Bed Bath etc and the price was $90 plus tax, so Amazon&#x27;s  price of $60 was a significant discount.&lt;br /&gt;Does it do a good at flossing?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use my sonicare toothbrush and then I use the electric flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Its quick and easy and my teeth feel squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> best thing i ever bought for my teeth.</li>
            <li> It works, but won&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare Airfloss is the best on the market dental airfloss system unit. It&#x27;s easy to use and everyone in my family loves it.</li>
            <li> Love it, combined with my sonicare it makes your mouth feel &amp;#34;dentist office clean&amp;#34; easy to use very portable. Best when used with mouthwash,</li>
            <li> My Oral Hygienist recommended this product to be used in addition to brushing and flossing. It works great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh as I use it with mouth wash. My wife was jealous so I got one for her too</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3-4 years.  My dental exams have been perfect.  Too bad this product is poorly made, constantly having to call the company for replacement.  The one I just received is once again shooting the mouthwash/water into my eyes and onto my bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I told their representative that this needs to be redesigned.  When it works its great!  Too expensive for the constant replacements needed.</li>
            <li> A solid enhancement to a regular program of good dental care.  Very refreshing and effective.  You can load with mouthwash for even better results.</li>
            <li> The flosser does not work any more as the fluid/air leak at the joint of the flosser head and the replaceable tip. Very frustrating experience. I completely lost my money.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; my teeth with this appliance.  It works great and really does clean between my teeth.  It also works well to clean around things like crowns, implants, veneers, etc.  Not surprisingly, it does splash somewhat, so I just hold a washcloth to my mouth when using it.  You can use any type of liquid with it, such as cavity preventative, moisturizer for dry mouth, mouthwash, or just water.  I asked my dentist about them and he thinks they are great.</li>
            <li> Excellent - in just 2 weeks I have experienced great improvement in my gums - had a couple of spots that were previously inflamed and the dentist told me to give extra attention to these areas.  Purchased this product and it has really helped improve my gum issues...</li>
            <li> This product is all it is cracked up to be. Does a better job than regular floss for those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The unit functioning as what I have imagined. After the initial 24 hours charing, the battery was able to last for more than 1 week, on one use per day basis.</li>
            <li> made my gum bleed, very awarkard to use. now it just sits there, wont recommend it.  .waste money. not good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Dislodges food particles gently. Is a quick, easy way ro floss. 6 month check up will be the deciding factor.</li>
            <li> Fast and convenient to use</li>
            <li> Talk about Rad!  This flosser is super.  I do not like to floss not matter what my dentist says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the feel of thread between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill this flosser with my special mouth rinse and go to town on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My whole my mouth feel really clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I brush with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> not what I expected ...messy to use.</li>
            <li> This air flosser is one of the best new devices to save you a lot of money when you go to the dentist. I have been using one for several years – and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. The quality control on this product is not very good. I had this one for a month and it stopped working. However, Phillips has wonderful customer support and they immediately sent me a replacement which works fine. The warranty. Is quite good. That is very fortunate since I am on my second air flosser. I would not be without it. I have not had a problem with my gums or teeth since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after just over a month of use.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and it is hard to use floss.  This Electric Flosser really does the job so easily and it is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> This is a really great working unit.  It uses mouthwash or water and shoots it between your teeth when you&#x27;ve centered the tip between your teeth.  I tried it by flossing with my Glide floss first.  Rinsed, then used the Sonicare Airfloss.  There were additional food particles that came out after using the Airfloss. It&#x27;s easy to use and not as messy as the Water-Pic that was relegated to a shelf in my garage a long time ago.  It&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s easy to use and it functions really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in combination with the Sonicare Black Diamond Professional electric toothbruth (about $190 less $20.00 rebate)</li>
            <li> Good machine, well designed, and works great, but too much jolting pressure against sensitive areas in the mouth with extensive dental work.  Only one setting--very robust.  Not suitable, in my opinion, for areas around implants especially.  I much prefer my water pic coupled with ultra texture floss.  Much gentler way to clean between teeth I think.  Donated mine to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> JUNK and Philips is DECEPTIVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through FOUR replacements and now they say it is out of warranty and will NOT replace it, even though I am supposed to have an &amp;#34;extended&amp;#34; warranty. In addition, it took THREEE DAYS for them to respond, UNACCETABLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptom always the same, stops firing in about four months and WILL NOT recharge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, this product has a SERIOUS design defect as one, maybe two can fail but FOUR!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep asking questions why it fails but I tell you that I use it only TWICE a day, recharge it and use nothing but a dental rinse as they approve in the labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it works fine for four months, then fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is JUNK and they MUST be aware of it as I cannot be the ONLY person having multiple failures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER buying another Philips product..... EVER!</li>
            <li> I t was working fine until July 2nd when battery died and I place flosser on charger. Is not charging! Please send me return envelope and I will send all back. to you. Do not know what the problem is. Green light is going on for short(few seconds) time and goes off. What a piece of crab for so much money! I was able to charge only two times in the past and now I am trying to charge for past two weeks! Giving three stars since it was working for a few months( I did not use for two months after delivery since it was delivered to vacation home)</li>
            <li> This really helps with getting my teeth fully clean.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a life long floss hater.  I have a small, narrow mouth with tight contacts between my teeth.  Flossing always hurts because the force required to get even the thinnest, slickest floss between my teeth jams the floss down into my gums once it gets past the contact surface.  UGH!  Then it&#x27;&#x27;s hard for me to get the floss positioned for the back teeth in my tiny mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I developed a pocket around a tooth that shifted--making a big wide space.  Food gets stuck in that pocket and HURTS!  I can&#x27;t get it out with floss, which only seems to pack it in harder.  So I went to the store intending to by a cordless water-pik like device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This caught my eye, but I didn&#x27;t really know what an air flosser was.  I was expecting a continuous stream and I was surprised by the tiny reservoir.  And when I pushed the button, I was shocked by the pop of the spring and the water shooting out in a forceful stream.  NOT what I expected.  Until I learned to aim the thing properly it HURT.  It hurt my gums and my tongue if it got in the way.  What the heck???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I quickly mastered how to aim it at the point at the base between teeth, and, WOW, it shot the gunk out my pocket.  Even for teeth with tight contacts it gets into that little space at the base of the teeth.  It&#x27;s probably not as good as real  flossing, but this is something I&#x27;m happy to use daily--I never flossed regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for six months now.  It works consistently, and I use it once or twice daily.  My hygienist reports that the pocket has gone from 5 to 4 mm, and my gums look better in general.  I&#x27;m even using floss a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be perfect in my dental hygienist&#x27;s eyes, but it&#x27;s a LOT better than not doing anything.  This takes some work and getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you hate to floss.</li>
            <li> Effective and easier to use than a flossing thread. Wish the reservoir were about four times as large, needs several refills during a cleaning session.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting with this product, dentist recommending this to my wife. Thought I would be getting more for the money, or maybe I am using it incorrectly. All this does is build up some pressure and shoot a short burst of liquid out. Stick with floss.</li>
            <li> Love my Philips Sonicare Airfloss.  Does a better job than I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and so easy to use.  I fill mine with mouthwash instead of water.</li>
            <li> Excellent for removal of food, etc that even flossing has missed.  Your mouth is so clean feeling if you use mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Airfloss for a few weeks and I love it! I bought it on my dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and it&#x27;s every bit as handy as she said it is. I HATE flossing but I&#x27;ve learned that, sadly, it must be done to have healthy teeth and gums. Enter the Airfloss. It&#x27;s so easy to use (point the tip to the gaps between your teeth and push the button) and it&#x27;s very powerful! It actually does get the job done. I&#x27;ve manually flossed after use of the Airfloss several times and the floss has come out pretty much clean each time. I also LOVE that you can fill the reservoir with water or mouthwash. I fill it with mouthwash and it&#x27;s not only refreshing, but I like that you can target between the teeth and make sure the mouthwash really gets in there! It shouldn&#x27;t replace manual flossing altogether, but it certainly makes it much, much easier and you don&#x27;t have to reach for the floss as often if you use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I still floss each day but also use the Sonicare flosser!  It does a great job,  makes your teeth and mouth feel extremely clean!</li>
            <li> This unit works fine, but I wonder if it does as good a job at getting plaque off  my teeth. Additionally, it&#x27;s quite messy with spray going everywhere so you must keep your mouth closed when using. I will continue to use but also use floss during the week.</li>
            <li> Love this flosser! I put Closys mouthwash in it and go to town! I was skeptical at first because I had never used an electric flosser. It has been a positive experience. I do still use the HydroFloss as well when I feel like taking my mouth to the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34;. Would highly reco to all!</li>
            <li> This is a great unit. It really gets the stuff between you teeth out of the nooks and crannies. It works very well and you can use it with just plain water or with your preferred Mouthwash. Very good item.</li>
            <li> When I first used this,I thought it was garbage.  But I continued using it, and changed my mind.  I think it is similar to flossing, but different.  Battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> When I opening the packaging, I realized that it looked like a product already used!I Followed the instructions correctly.The first time I called worked just a little.Stopped and never worked.&lt;br /&gt;The device came in packaging different from that I seen in other places. Only in a cardboard box, and was dirty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It sounds like a good idea but it really doesn&#x27;t work that well. I still had to use regular floss&lt;br /&gt;to remove food left behind.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. We have used it for almost two years and the Dental tech says she notices an improvement in our gums</li>
            <li> Really powerful. If it causes bleeding you need to get to a dentist. I recently was fitted with a bridge and this does the job of cleaning under and around it. I bought a double pack- one quit working. Instructions say it is for the front of the teeth, but I find it can work well from &amp;#34;inside&amp;#34; the mouth. Would be excellent for those wearing braces.</li>
            <li> Works very good. I regret that I didn&#x27;t buy more. Waiting discount! Nice product!</li>
            <li> Unreliable product ..lasted only 6 months .not worth the money</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. Much better than flossing!</li>
            <li> i have a few big gaps between some of my teeth which it is really hard to get stuff out of. the sonicare doesn&#x27;t quite shift everything but it does a better job than anything else i have tried so i really like it.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one. My teeth feel cleaner. Good for your gums and basic oral wellnesd. Dentist recommended. Buy one!</li>
            <li> Using dental floss was difficult with my arthritis in my fingers. My dentist said I was going to need planing and scaling. He suggested I try the Sonicare airfloss and gave me one month to see if it improved my gums. It did and I don&#x27;t have to have the planing and scaling--not only saving me hundreds of dollars, but giving me an easier way to maintain healthy teeth and gums.The Sonicare airfloss is so much easier than flossing and quicker too.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has one too and loves his.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback--we each have our own because the individual sticks are not easy to change.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fit, for what I require in a product and I think this product is worth the price and when it comes to saving, Amazon is GREAT! ON A SCALE 1-10 the product rate as a 10, highly recommend, overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this devise on the recommendation of my Dentist.  I had it one week and the button to activate the devise stopped working.  I called the manufacture.  The instructions on the box said best used with mouth wash.  So, of course I did.  I used Listerine.  They told me that the devise will not work with any mouth wash that contained alcohol.  I asked where I could find this information since it wasn&#x27;t on the box or anywhere I could find in the instructions.  They told him it&#x27;s in the fine print within the instructions. They also told him there was nothing more they could do for me.</li>
            <li> Pulse it gives out is a little hard.  Wish it could be dialed down a notch.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dental hygienist last week.  I bought it on Friday and it arrived via Amazon Prime on Sunday.  I plugged it in expecting it to charge for 24 hours as indicated.  Ten-Twenty minutes later, the blinking charge light stopped blinking.  Assuming that the charger may not have been level on my counter-top, I re-positioned it and replaced the device for charging.  The light started blinking again and stopped a few seconds later.  I decided to allow it to stay connected and initiated a Chat session with Phillips Sonicare Customer Service after 12 hours with the charge light still not working.  Based on the fact that the Chat representative had indicated he was sending a replacement handle without actually addressing my request for a description of the device charge process and his automatic, canned, service response, I concluded there must be a language barrier of some sort and called them instead.  According to the phone representative, the telephonic customer service is US based.  The on-line Chat Customer Service is based somewhere else; however, the location of it was unknown to my telephone CS Rep.  In any case, the phone rep advised that somehow my device must have come pre-charged.  While unusual, the phone representative advised that this was why my device stopped charging after a few minutes.  As a result, he planned to cancel the Chat Representatives order for a replacement handset to be sent to me.  While I am glad the phone representative understood my issue and seems to have resolved it, I have no assurance that my device was really new and not a refurbished/repackaged return from someone who spent some time charging the device prior to returning it.  Given that it cost a small fortune, I am not happy that it wasn&#x27;t obvious that the product was new rather than just new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I purchased the FlexCare Plus Sonic Toothbrush with this.  That may indeed be a decent product; however, the two products together rival my monthly car payment in cost.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality; however, I skeptical about the quality of the AirFlosser received and really disappointed with Philips Customer Service.  I can&#x27;t see myself ever purchasing anything else from this company even if the product ultimately proves acceptable.  I never had these issues with WaterPik; however, I was led to believe Sonicare would be an improvement.  That remains to be seen; however, I know I prefer WaterPik&#x27;s customer service to that of Philip&#x27;s Sonicare.her rival my monthly car payment in cost.

            <li> Flossing is said to reduce heart attacks and grant you an extra 7 years of life. Your teeth will also look whiter if you floss since you will get into the nooks and crannies and get the dirt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for at least those three reasons that I am an avid flosser. Often, I floss up to three times a day. I didn&#x27;t always floss that frequently. In fact, until I was about 16 years old, I never flossed. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my first oral-B Hummingbird Flosser (since discontinued), which truly taught me to appreciate how much cleaner my gums felt after flossing. I&#x27;ve been flossing with a variety of different devices ever since, including but not limited to all kinds of floss, dental tape, Oral-B flosser with a handle, flosser toothpicks, and the hummingbird flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried an electric flosser until I tried Sonicare. Having tried practically every electronic toothbrush on the market, I prefer Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush above all others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare Airfloss is nicer than flossing manually, and it&#x27;s more powerful than a Hummingbird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it work? How effective is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it prior to brushing my teeth and found that a lot of stuff came out. I used it after I brushed my teeth and practically nothing came out. I would then go over with a regular floss and find that in a few instances the Airflosser did not get a few food particles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the convenience of using the Airflosser though since it&#x27;s a lot faster to use than flossing by hand. The downside to that is that the Airflosser is one-directional -- you can only do it from the outside of your teeth, not inside your mouth. This means that if your teeth are really close together, are crooked, or overlap, you will not get the full benefits of flossing (i.e., getting into every nook and cranny to get every last bit of the food particles that the brush missed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I also felt that the electric flosser was unnecessarily harsh. Although my gums didn&#x27;t bleed (as per the warning in the instructions), they did feel sore the first few times I used the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I never use mouthwash, I prefer to put a little bit of mouthwash into the Airflosser (the alternative is water). it leaves a much cleaner feeling and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my gums as sensitive to the burst of air that the Airflosser generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Airflosser would be good for someone transitioning into flossing. It&#x27;s a good starter tool - since it leaves the person experiencing the cleaner mouth, maybe it will lead to good hygiene and flossing technique with a regular, manual string, much like what the Hummingbird did for me years ago.For those of us who meticulous floss after every meal, the Airflosser will feel inadequate.</li>
            <li> I am a horrible flosser.  It&#x27;s gross, I know, but as good as I am at brushing and showing up for my 6-month dental checkups - I HATE flossing.  So when an alternative to this awful task became available - I jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the air flosser for about 2 ½ weeks now.  It&#x27;s much better than flossing - though honestly - it takes the same amount of time, if not a touch longer.  But it doesn&#x27;t make my gums bleed and I never end up with string in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used water first, then switched to mouthwash as the product suggests.  The sensation is not unpleasant.  After adding the mouthwash to the chamber (sometimes it leaks a bit and I wish you could lay the airflosser on its back as you fill it, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker), you press the button a few times to prime it and then shoot the mouthwash in-between each tooth \\&quot;joint\\&quot;.  (With your mouth closed or it gets messy.)  (Side note:  I thought it would come with several floss tips so that more than one person could use it.  Nope.  Just one.  That is a flaw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got back from my 6-month cleaning and my gum scores went up!  The dentist was impressed with the improvement and there was much less bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it goes long term - but so far so good!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser really seems to floss you teeth &#x27;dental hygienist&#x27; clean in seconds. I bought extra heads so the whole family can take advantage of this wonderful product. I remember the electric flossers of old - what a joke. Now these flossers are high-tect and my dentists even recommends. Definitely recommends!</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of the charging system. There are no exposed metal pieces and the charging station looks like little more than a plastic peg. But it certainly charges the piece well, and while I can&#x27;t vouch for the two weeks of charge (I put it back on the base after every use) I am sure that it&#x27;s correct. And I do appreciate that it turns itself off, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve turned the thing off one time since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this primarily with [[ASIN:B001ECQRIM Colgate Plax Cool Mint Mouthwash x 500ml]]. A big plus is that it leaves my mouth feeling very fresh, and not just like I used mouthwash by itself. Perfect for starting off the day. Over more usage I did find that I ended up using this twice a day (not that I&#x27;d ever floss twice a day), and in the morning I preferred to use the mouthwash in the reservoir, while at night I ended up using plain water. (Side note: things got &#x27;foamy&#x27; when using the mouthwash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that I found more food particles and \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; between my teeth using this, and I&#x27;m not positive that it&#x27;s just as effective as flossing, but over a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it. I certainly spend less time than flossing (including twice a day now) and it&#x27;s not inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note- I&#x27;m a bit of a bleeder when it comes to flossing, but even though it warns about the possibility of bleeding when using this device, I have not found this the case at all when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that they sell replacement heads, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to have to replace them more often than recommended because the instructions say to rinse out after every use... and I&#x27;m about as likely to rinse these twice a day, as I am to start flossing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great just cleaned teeth feeling after usuing. As if you were just at the dentist. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser is not a replacement for true flossing (with actual floss). However, it can be helpful as part of the rotation for a versatile tooth cleaning routine. For example, in situations where tooth location and dexterity issues may make it hard to get to a particular spot with traditional floss or floss picks. It can also be a \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot; option on days/nights where you may be too tired or brain dead for a proper manual flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few days to get the hang of it. There are two ways to use it. Manual bursts by pressing the button up top (at the green colored incline) for each individual burst, or putting it in 1-second burst mode, where it shoots a burst every 1 second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can fill the small reservoir with either water or mouth wash, your choice. I prefer water. The reservoir is not as deep as the product pictures here may indicate. It is fairly shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is built-in the device, so there&#x27;s only way to charge it, by using the included AC adapter. The device is not sitting solidly on the AC charging dock. It wobbles if you touch it. The instructions say to charge it for 24 hours for the first time (the first charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user manual states that this must only be used from the outer side of the teeth, not from within. It does not state why this is so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always a good idea to ask your dentist before using things like this, especially if you have work in progress or any other special situations or on-going issues and such. The water+air has some pressure to it - you may want to test it before using it in your mouth. For example, I can feel the hit on my palm a couple of inches away from the nozzle opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNBOXING: the device is inside a blister pack that is inside the outer box. The blister pack is easy to open without tools by separating the two interlocking parts. Inside the blister pack you will find the device, its AC charging dock, and paperwork (quick start guide, longer guide, registration). The registration card says if you register it, you get an additional six months added to the warranty. The base of the device and the detachable floss tip are individually wrapped for extra protection.</li>
            <li> overall i like this airfloss but not sure about the reliablity.  i think it is guaranteed for 2 years but had to send the first one back after one month, and the second one quit just over one year. maybe i am not using it correctly, pressing the button too many times, or battery just stopped working, low quality, other? detailed instructions are hard to find. it seems to work because the dental hygenist doesnt complain about my gums as much as she used to. i spend about 15 minutes each night cleaning my teeth with manual brush, sonicare brush, airfloss, manual floss, water pik because i have spent so much money on bridges, implants, etc and have spent too much time and pain in dentist chair since i was a child.</li>
            <li> performs as advertized and does what I expected</li>
            <li> Very good, cleans your teeth very well and makes you feel fresh, as if you just have some dental cleaning by the professionals.</li>
            <li> Left to be desired. Expect more of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve read about to keep healthy gums. Not to mention it&#x27;s much more fun when it comes to flossing.</li>
            <li> Putting aside a couple of (possibly) minor technical faults and issues relating to the battery and charger, from a pure usage point of view there are other factors which prompted me to send mine back today for a refund.    First, if you have closely spaced teeth, the device doesn&#x27;t seem to be as capable or effective cleaning between them.    Second, the maintenance required (for hygiene as well as product function) is a bit bothersome.  In the time it takes to fill the tiny reservoir with water or mouthwash, prime the unit, floss my teeth, rinse the nozzle, rinse, empty and dry the reservoir, I could have flossed with string multiple times and been done with it.    Add to that the unit isn&#x27;t truly considered a replacement for standard flossing and there are enough reasonable caveats to give one pause.    As always, your mileage may vary.  For me, while I absolutely love my recently acquired Sonicare \\&quot;Easy Clean\\&quot; toothbrush, the \\&quot;airfloss\\&quot; was not the solution I was searching for.</li>
            <li> works real well and makes you want to floss every day!</li>
            <li> I should have gotten the Waterpik. This thing works well but I have to refill it a few times in one use. This is ok but sometimes it won&#x27;t work when I first turned it on and after hold the button for a moment while its still on the charger for it to stay on after I remove it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a flosser but my husband has not.  A little over a year and a half ago we stumbled upon the Philips Sonicare Airfloss.  We were already using Sonicare toothbrushes (and love them), so my husband agreed to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my dental hygienist if I could use the Airfloss instead of traditional floss and she recommended against it.  Well, don&#x27;t tell her but I did it anyway.  I&#x27;ve had two 6 months cleanings since starting to use the Airfloss daily, and she hasn&#x27;t noticed the difference.  Last visit I even asked if everything seemed \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and she said \\&quot;yes\\&quot; (Believe me...she&#x27;d tell me if it wasn&#x27;t even if I didn&#x27;t ask!)  I like the Airfloss so much better than traditional floss...even though I used traditional floss faithfully, the Airfloss takes the chore out of flossing.  Plus, I have tight spacing between my teeth and the Airfloss never gets stuck and breaks.  And, no gum bleeding by accidently applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has also had success with the Airfloss.  His dentist constantly lectured him on flossing and his cleanings were always painful from all the scraping.  He has come home with glowing reviews from his last two cleanings. Before Airfloss he hated the dentist...now, not such a big deal.  This is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s miserable  i&#x27;m sorry I bought it. it hurts, and is ,messy and doesn&#x27;t get the debris out.  how do I return it?  I don&#x27;t use it.  help!</li>
            <li> for those of us with extensive crowns, bridges, and partial  whatevers, this gadget is a waste of time and effort.  Your dentists have better equipment and this is not even 2nd best.  I went back over my teeth with floss after having used this device and guess what the floss worked and the device did nothing.  Save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on this device.</li>
            <li> When I first used this cleaner it did not feel as it was doing much. However, I found that even if I first used a brush, this device removed much food particles still left.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well but gums bleed excessively . I use mouthwash and works great for fresh breath and clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I used this for three months.  I was told by the dentist&#x27;s office that it&#x27;s really to get people who don&#x27;t regularly floss to do something.  It isn&#x27;t the same as using floss. I was really disappointed that I had so much scraping to be done.  I still use it especially under my bridges but now I floss also.</li>
            <li> This one was the cheapest we could find.  Works great.  Took a bit of time to get it but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is as good as using floss string. I bought 2 more for my grandchildren. It is so easy. You can walk around while doing it. Much easier than the old floss string.</li>
            <li> Cleans and removes better than any dental floss. Compact, can even travel with.  Battery lasts quite a while too.  Highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to ability to clean around gumline.  Quite powerful and long-lasting charge. Product recommended to me by my dentist&#x27;s office to clean gum area around dental implants.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product which does exactly what it is supposed to. The main problem with this item is the flimsy hinge on the door of the water compartment. On my wife&#x27;s unit the door actually broke off after 2 months. I will soon find out how their customer service department handles the problem. I&#x27;ll report back when I have the answer. This is an update of my original review. All I can say is save your money. Do not buy this product. My original unit stopped working after 10-12 weeks. I didn&#x27;t want to buy another, but my wife really liked the product so I relented. After 4 weeks the reservoir door popped off that one and the unit puffed its last puff after 10-12 weeks. I called Phillips customer service and they were very understanding. They sent me two new units to replace the broken ones along with a postage paid return label. I started using one of the replacements and put the other away. After 10-12 weeks the first replacement broke and we started using the second. We then called Phillips who has now agreed to give us a replacement for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, beats flossing</li>
            <li> Like going to the dentist every night, awesome feeling.</li>
            <li> Does not deliver the cleaning as vigorously as advertised.  Not much better than their standard models.  Not worth the expense if you have a standard base-tube-appliance model.</li>
            <li> This is a product you don&#x27;t need.  It does shoot mouthwash or plaque rinse between you teeth but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for some people who have advanced gum disease with deep pockets around the teeth.  After using this product you can remove additional plaque forming particles using Gum Eez-Thru Flossers Mint which work better and are less trouble.  Just use the Gum Flossers instead.  May work well enough for some people without any gum disease although I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Philips Sonicare HX6921/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush (which I really like) - I do not recommend buying this.  It is kind of a pain to set up, and in my humble opinion not really all that helpful.</li>
            <li> love this product! it cleans in between teeth in a heartbeat. gone is the day of dragging myself to floss</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips Airfloss for almost a year now and still use it almost daily.  I use it after flossing to get the particles that flossing seems to miss.  Please note, as other reviewers have commented, this is not intended to replace regular flossing, but instead to supplement it for a healthier gumline and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself works very well, it is built well, sturdy, and is easy to use.  The charging stand is conductive so you just sit it on the stand and it starts charging... very convenient!  After using it, I can see food particles that flossing missed, and it also leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean!  I found that using a bit of mouthwash in it along with water leaves a great clean feeling.  If the mouthwash is less strong than a Listerine, then you can use just mouthwash and it works and feels great!  The unit is also water resistant so works great in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints about it is that the unit itself is quite big in size, and for its size it has a relatively small reservoir for holding the water / mouthwash.  You can use it about 2 times without refilling, but for a unit this size, it should hold more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great unit, and as long as its used in ADDITION to flossing, you will notice how clean and great it makes your mouth feel after every use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have all crowns, an this product is super!  Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I charged it for 24 hrs before using as instructed. The instructions say it will last 14 days on one charge. Mine does NOT. Mine only lastx 4-5 days on a charge and then I have to let it charge for 24 hrs again. Another thing I do not like, as it gives NO warning, when the battery is wearing down. I will start it up - put it into my mouth and it just dies - so my mouth doesn&#x27;t get clean that night - if there was some kind of warning - I could re-charge it before it gets to that point.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have to recommend it - since my hygenist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I have some issues with my gum I hope its can help me to reduce this issues</li>
            <li> Who likes to floss their teeth?  This electric tooth flosser is thorough and takes just a few minutes for the whole mouth of teeth.  The liquid reservoir can contain plain water or your choice of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> fine while it lasted. the product just died within 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and does a good job. I still need to use flossing so I use both.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one but I gave it to my husband for a birthday present. At first I think he was skeptical but now I see him using it twice a day. He says it gets to places the floss does not.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the Sonicare toothbrush that I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase the flosser. Pretty disappointing. I used a waterpick back in the early 70&#x27;s and it seemed to me to work every bit as well or better than the Sonicare product. It has to be refilled a lot and it seems to leak from the reservoir, that drives me crazy. Use it every day and it seems to do a good enough job at keeping my teeth clean. It is NOT a game changer like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Frustrated that while it worked well for a short time that it broke completely after only two months. I would like to return it to for a refund. I am very displeased</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter who just got braces.  It works very well, stays charged.  When she got her expander, it blew everything out that got stuck.  Great product!  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> the only problem i have is it leaks a little when you put the mouth wash in and use it in your mouth.  otherwise, seems to being a very good job of cleaning in between the teeth-it isn&#x27;t as harsh as flossing and does not make your gums bleed like poking around with floss or brush pick</li>
            <li> This air floss seems like a good idea however, you need regular flossing it doesn&#x27;t have the power to clean properly&lt;br /&gt;between you teeth. My dentist recommended but is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This will get SOME stuff dislodged from your teeth, but it&#x27;s not a real substitute for regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As dental technology becomes more practical and portable in the home, I&#x27;m always interested in new products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They pitch this to someone who doesn&#x27;t normally floss their teeth, and as a &amp;#34;30 second cleaning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t agree with the logic. that If you don&#x27;t normally floss, that you will be &amp;#34;more inclined&amp;#34; to use a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;(only you can answer that question)&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the process takes much longer than 30 seconds, based on operation, technique, repeating and clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of those qualifiers out of the way, the product itself is only marginally functional.&lt;br /&gt;The poof of air could be a little stronger, but if targeted properly, and if you don&#x27;t have really tight spaces between your teeth, it should be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes too much so. Sometimes, it will overshoot through a wider gap, and sting the tongue or other side of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;So absolutely should become comfortable with positioning the tool, so as not to shoot downward and harm your gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also concerned about long term cleaning of a unit like this. I&#x27;ve had portable water-piks in the past that were just a pain to keep clean. If I don&#x27;t flush it properly for cleaning, it could potentially create a bigger problem than it solves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s probably an extra layer, that is not quite there yet. You can probably get better results with traditional flossing, with a similar time investment.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  I love Sonic toothbrushes.  However, the first airfloss stopped working after about a month.  I called Sonicare, received a replacement and a return label to return the 1st one.  After about a week the 2nd one stopped working.  I called again and said it would take about 8 weeks to get the paperwork for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime I purchased a Waterpik flosser and though it is bulkier than the Sonic, so far it is working.</li>
            <li> Functionally great. Needs a flat surface on the back side so you can set it down to fill reservoir.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. I find it encourages me to use the mouth wash more often since I can use mouth wash to floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll find out if my Dentist agrees in about 3 more months, but he is the one who recommended it so I expect a positive review of my oral health.</li>
            <li> Gotta fill it up constantly.</li>
            <li> awesome tool! and the kids love flossing, better yet!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit for my wife for Christmas in 2012.  It comes with a 2 year warrantee.  I just called them and told them for the 2nd time this unit has died.  You power it up and press the button to activate the air floss pump and it just turns off.  This is the problem I experienced in 2013 and again in January of 2014.  I explained that their product obviously does not last for more than 10 months and that they need to fix the obvious flaw it has in its design.  The woman I talked to told me that even though I had registered the product they would need my original receipt to honor the warrantee at this time. I explained that it was purchased as a gift back in 2012 and even though I registered it back then they still insisted getting the cash register receipt from me.  So I am not in a position of having a dead unit and can&#x27;t get a replacement for the 3rd time without providing my original receipt.  It is apparent this unit won&#x27;t last more than 10 months to don&#x27;t buy it, it is a rip off and will cost you just under $10 a month to own.</li>
            <li> the box was not sealed, no papers on instructions, no warranty paper.  It looked like it was a used one!</li>
            <li> I was not able to register the product in Autralia</li>
            <li> I am not in love with how it feels when it squirts between my teeth.  I am a flosser, switching from using regular tooth floss.  I don&#x27;t like the way that feels either, but I feel that I am getting a better cleaning with the floss rather than the water sports.  So, I am using it every other day to ensure I can get a quality clean.  I have been using it for  a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone in the family. They are very happy with how it cleans as expected and use it daily after tooth brishing with the Diamond Sonicare brush. The great battery life has made it very convenient to take along for frequent business travel, even overseas.</li>
            <li> Stopped holding a charge after 60 or so days.  Ridiculous...</li>
            <li> I hate to floss, so my dentist recommended I try the Sonicare Airfloss unit.  Love it!  Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  The only negative I can find is trying to completely fill the reservoir without spilling mouthwash all over it and my hand.</li>
            <li> The first unit had an issue with retaining a charge, however, second one works perfect. This product is easy to use. I am very pleased with this Phillip Sonicare electric flosser.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to use and gives my mouth a fresh feel.  I won&#x27;t know how well it has worked until my next dental visit for cleaning.  I was told I had a fairly deep pocket that needed work so this will be a good test.  In the meantime, with a dash of mouth wash in the appliance, I enjoy this method of &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; each night before bed.  Sure beats dragging the floss between the teeth.  I did experience on caveat on early use.  I got through the teeth cleaning without incident and then while cleaning the appliance I left the unit turned and while wiping it down I hit the button and squirted myself in the eye.  Fortunately I wear glasses as it hits with quite a force that I don&#x27;t think would have pleasant in the eye....using mouthwash.  Careful, folks.</li>
            <li> It is Exactly what I wanted,, and got it a lot cheaper from here !  Thank you so much I am having fun using this</li>
            <li> Good product just not convinced how well it cleans</li>
            <li> I can easily find the spaces between my teeth!</li>
            <li> Works relatively well but it does not feel like a complete substitute for normal&lt;br /&gt;Flossing to me.  My flossed also developed a crack by the power button within a few months for no reason I can figure out.  It still works but the crack concerns me.</li>
            <li> excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!!!!!!! I feel like I flossed for the very first time when I first used this. I love that I can put my own mouthwash in it!!</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love this, but still need to use in conjunction with traditional flossing</li>
            <li> It doesnt work as well as others on the market for 1/3 the price... Reservoir is too small as well... Annoying to use...</li>
            <li> Every time I go to the dentist, I get scolded for not flossing. I get a cleaning every 3 months because of gingivitis and it is always painful. I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t floss, I just don&#x27;t but always say I will. At my last visit, my hygienist recommended the Sonicare Airflosser. I read the reviews at Amazon and almost didn&#x27;t buy it. So many reviews were bad--mostly claiming that the pressure is too low and flossing or the Waterpick are better. But because I trust my hygienist, I took the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the pressure is definitely NOT too low. The first week or two it made my gums bleed. If I miss my teeth and hit my tongue, it is painful. If the pressure was higher, I would not use it. Now that my gums are better conditioned, the pressure doesn&#x27;t feel as high, but I know it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, flossing is better. But that is not the point. If I don&#x27;t floss, then it doesn&#x27;t matter. The Sonicare is more fun and I actually use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I had my first cleaning since buying it. The hygienist was amazed (before I told her I was doing anything different). There was hardly any tarter between my teeth and my gums look a lot better. The cleaning was much quicker and much less painful than before. So there is the proof for me...the cost is negligible for the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well it&#x27;s been around a year and a half of consistently good cleanings. Unfortunately, it died last night. I guess $100 every year or so is still cheap to save my gums, but then again I wasn&#x27;t planning on this being a subscription plan. I suppose will have to deduct a star (to 4) for durability.</li>
            <li> ...otherwise suck it up and floss the old fashioned way!  Or use a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Airfloss is more of a tool for those with dental work preventing normal flossing.  Or those who just can&#x27;t stand flossing the old fashioned way.  But after using this several times I was unimpressed.  Instead I reverted back to my old Oral B satin floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good idea, but nearly $100 isn&#x27;t worth it to replace normal floss.  Even if the price over time pays for itself in actual disposable floss purchases (which is why I was intrigued in the first place).  The cleaning level is about a two whereas satin floss is about a four.  And a waterpik is a five.  Estimate those &#x27;floss&#x27; action toothbrushes at a one and no flossing at zero and you have a barometer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: use normal floss or get a waterpik.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t like flossing. It doesn&#x27;t take long and is incredibly important. That said, when there&#x27;s a device that can take the place of flossing, I always seem to take a look. This is pretty neat since you can place your favorite mouthwash in it and blast the plaque between your teeth; that said, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s effective enough or even quick enough to replace flossing. Overall, I think this can be a useful part of your dental care, but I&#x27;m going to stick with the good &#x27;ole fashioned flossing for the time being.</li>
            <li> This is a great accessory that helps me keep my mouth and teeth very, very clean.  Even after flossing, when I use the Airfloss, it finds more food particles.  I use this in addition to the Sonicare toothbrush, and I know my next dentist appointment will be a 5 star appointment!</li>
            <li> I only need a bigger reservoir, because I always have used more than one time between my teeths</li>
            <li> Works great. Broke down (wouldn&#x27;t charge) once, but the Philips after sales service impressed me. They mailed me a new one and I shipped the old one to them to fix.</li>
            <li> I love this it is my second one. Although I have had problems in the past with my first one the customer service was awesome and they always took care of it very quickly without making you feel bad. My dental appointments have been a lot better :)</li>
            <li> Instructions do not make it clear that tip must be pushed into device until it snaps in place and if you don&#x27;t do that the tip flies out of the device.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic cover for water detaches from device too easily.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Needs more pressure</li>
            <li> SWEET. Love how good my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> I have bridge on the lower incisors. I had problem cleaning the area under the bridge. For that matter I used to feel pain in that region. My cousin who is a dentist recommended this product to me. Ever since I started using this product it works magic on my mouth. It is a great product and performance is amazing.</li>
            <li> Good product. For me an easier way to floss, &amp; does a good job. Only problem is, I was unable to find any replacement heads for it, except on-line. Checked in CVS, Walgreen s &amp; two Walmart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good product, but only issue is that it can&#x27;t replace the battery....</li>
            <li> It takes a few squirts between certain teeth for me and I find that I have to refill the mouthwash receptacle quite often but it works well enough and I can see that it removes a lot of debris when I finally spit all the mouthwash out.Do this before brushing and it will allow the fluoride from your toothpaste to settle in deeper in your gums. Definitely keep your lips closed around the stem though as you will get blow back on you mirror if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> What a great product.....3 people use it every day. Never had better check ups....suggest using mouth wash, not water .....double cleaning action....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful,but I think it is too violent for teeth.Just use it sometimes</li>
            <li> I think it is doing its job. I have this air floss for couple weeks and I like it. The only thing which I notice that this unit has to be charge 24 hours each time, not only first time. If you won&#x27;t do 24 charge each time, it wont last you long. Maybe it is my unit but the charging/ power light is kind of useless. I would prefer if this unit would screen showing you battery life. I hope next version will be improved. If you have problems with flossing, gum diseases, get it. I was thinking to buy waterpik floss which is great but it is messy.  this is a simple solution.</li>
            <li> This works great, It is a little messy but I do see it removing food particles from between teeth, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as good as an actual string floss. My next dentist cleaning will show.</li>
            <li> My gums never felt so healthy. It does a wonderful job. No particles stuck between teeth. My mouth feels so clean especially when I use mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li> I love this this device....I&#x27;m certain the 2nd generation will be even better.  I don&#x27;t mind using this 2 or 3 times a day.  Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Very good, It works really well, very happy with the product, I had very good results with it and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these almost two years ago and it is still working fine.  I hate to floss so this is a painless and quick alternative for me. I have some teeth where they are close together and the Airfloss has trouble getting between them, but placing the head at an angle or moving it a little farther up seems to work pretty well. The Airfloss uses the same charger that my Sonicare toothbrush uses so that is handy. I have no doubt that real flossing is better for your teeth and gums, but for someone like me who has never been in the habit of flossing, this is much better than doing nothing besides brushing. I was actually in the market for a Waterpick when I decided this would be a lot more convenient, and I think I made the right decision.  Between the Airfloss and my Sonicare toothbrush my dentist no longer complains about my lack of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use mouthwash in my Airfloss and find that a small travel size bottle is the easiest way to refill the small reservoir.  I then refill the travel size bottle from a large size when needed using a very small funnel.  My Airfloss has developed a unique characteristic that might be due to my exclusive use of mouthwash.  After doing the first half of my teeth I need to open the reservoir lid to release pressure, otherwise hardly anything is dispensed from the nozzle.  I can actually hear the air release when I open the lid.  This is a very minor issue that might be caused by my mouthwash clogging something up inside the unit that would normally prevent an air-lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did replace the nozzle one time when they were on sale, but I didn’t really need to because it seems they hardly wear out at all.</li>
            <li> I received this not long ago and I already have to call in to get a replacement or it repaired.&lt;br /&gt;The button that you depress for it to function doesn&#x27;t work unless I use all the strength I have in my fingers to press down on it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist. I put mouthwash in it and it gets between my teeth and has prevented a series of problems I had been having.</li>
            <li> The best , just 30 seconds to do the whole mouth, much much easier that regular flossing, better results than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;You can use your favorite mouth wash . The first charge is 24 hours, after that each charge is until it stops blinking usually overnight, one charge using it 2 times a day last around 10 days.</li>
            <li> This struck me as something of a novel item so I was very keen to try it out. I am not a great fan of flossing and therefore use an assortment of dental probes to remove foreign bodies from between my teeth. The idea of a device, in appearance very like an electric toothbrush, which does the job is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially tried this out using mouthwash in the reservoir. The result was a very fresh mouth, much like one had gargled with mouthwash. However, I did not feel it was a fair test of whether it will substitute for flossing and I left that test for the occasion on which I feasted on a meaty dinner. This always drives me mad as I hate having bits stuck between my teeth. This evening we tried goulash which is a dish which could have been designed for such a test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flosser was very effective in removing the debris and running my tongue around my mouth afterwards I was unable to detect any remaining meat. The other advantage is that it is effective in clearing small gaps between teeth where it is difficult to get a probe. Overall I was impressed with the Power Flosser which I will be using on a twice daily basis in future. The only thing to note is that you really do need to keep your mouth closed whilst using it (unlike one of the illustrations) as it does tend to potentially spray a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a so great production. I cannot leave it after buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use dental floss.</li>
            <li> I bought one at Target on clearance. It worked awesome for about 6 weeks, then stopped working completely. I was stuck with it at that point. I bought one on Amazon, and same thing....great for few weeks, then suddenly stops working. They sent a replacement, which is currently charging, so we&#x27;ll see how this one goes. I&#x27;m giving it so many chances because when it works, I really like what a good job it does. I use mouthwash in the reservoir and it feels very thorough and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing a much better job of flossing than I do, even though I use regular floss right before I use this.</li>
            <li> Product died after 60 days of use.  This is my 5th one and they have all died - no functionality after a short period of time.  When working they were great but reliability is aweful.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  However, you have to keep your tongue out of the way because it stings if it hits your tongue.  Also, inside of cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love, I have braces so I can&#x27;t clean between my tooth and this do a great job you can filled whit you prefered mouthwash.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM FAILED AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE. I failed to keep the packaging and the paper work.</li>
            <li> I should have taken the reviews seriously before I purchased this.  As others have said, it worked great for as long as it lasted--which for me was less than three months.  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> battery does not hold a charge more than 1 1/2 uses unless I use it sparingly. Have to charge it every day.</li>
            <li> Worked OKt when ordered and delivered on time.  However, it is less than a year old and no longer works.  Need to check warranty to see if is still under warranty.</li>
            <li> RE: WHY ENTITLED TO IMMEDIATE REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH A RETURN. Permofance, results as described &#x3D; 1, using a 1 to 10 scale. For example, a tooth pick form a Chinese resteraunt is better than this product.</li>
            <li> Throw your string floss away and buy this air floss. This air floss is worth every penny, it cleans between teeth so much better and softer than any string floss. It has a reservoir you can fill with mouthwash and it will burst streams of mouthwash between your teeth for a much cleaner and fresher feel. You can choose auto burst or single burst with the push of the button. The battery is very long lasting, it can be utilized numerous times on a single charge. Overall this is a great flossing system that is easy on the gums and does a great job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows the importance of flossing but most dentists will tell you most people don&#x27;t do enough of it.  We&#x27;ve gotten better about it around our house over the last few years but the fact still remains that no one seems to like to floss.  We several different types of string floss in our bathrooms as well as [[ASIN:B00488A9VU DenTek Complete Clean Floss Picks, Fresh Mint 75 ea]] but we&#x27;re always looking for ways to make flossing easier and more enjoyable.  Enter the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser.\\&quot;  Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Good for those areas with braces or wires where regular floss is difficult or near impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Both water and mouthwash can be used in the rinse reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Quick floss time of approximately 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Air floss bursts are quick and powerful removing most leftover food quickly from between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Air flossing mechanism is very strong and definitely not for use by those with sensitive teeth or gums even though it says it&#x27;s gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Recharge stand is very unstable when the flosser is attached. The slightest bump and the whole unit instantly tips over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Flossing unit size is a bit larger than it really needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used nothing but manual string floss and dental floss picks in the past, I was in for quite a different flossing experience with the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX8211 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser.\\&quot; You definitely see flossing in a different manner as the air floss bursts do take some getting used to. Once you become accustomed to the quick bursts you can feel an improved clean feeling after each use. While I&#x27;m not sure how long the flosser heads last I did notice that you can replace them rather affordably here, [[ASIN:B0086VIAB6 Philips Sonicare HX8002/30 Airfloss Replacement Nozzles, 2 Pack]].  My main issue when using this flosser was it was just a little too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.  My long years of night time teeth grinding has caused a lot of enamel loss as well as gum recession so this flosser wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.  My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  Given the mixed reception, the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX8211 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser\\&quot; gets a solid 3 stars from our household.e too much for my overly sensitive teeth and gums.

My other half however absolutely loves it since he absolutely hates manual flossing.  Given the mixed reception, the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX8211 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser\\&quot; gets a solid 3 stars from our household.</li>
            <li> Flossing.  It&#x27;s one of those things we know are good for you but what a chore it can be.  Philips Sonicare brushes are such a joy to use so when I saw they make a gadget for flossing, naturally I figured this could be the answer to my flossing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism is a little loud once you engage the button to release the shot of water.  May be best not to use this while a sleeping baby is in the vicinity.  There seems to be a little getting used to it, as it can feel a little unsettling at first.  I feel a bit underwhelmed since I was hoping the effectiveness would be more on par with floss but alas it seems either more experience using the device will make one more adept or perhaps it&#x27;s more of a supplement to brushing and flossing regularly.  A piece of food that is stuck in the gum, such a skin from an apple didn&#x27;t pop right out, this seems to be more useful for plaque between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This tool has one function; to clean in-between teeth from the front only with a burst of air and water or mouthwash. It would be marginally better than not flossing at all but just shooting a burst of mouthwash in between your teeth is not a real substitute for flossing. I use a Waterpik as part of my routine and that is capable of cleaning under the gums around all surfaces of the tooth. A Waterpik can even remove something like a piece of popcorn hull from under your gums.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is very small; 1 1/2 teaspoons. But for the amount that&#x27;s is used with each burst it will last through about 2-3 bursts for each space. They recommend replacing the nozzle every 6 months&lt;br /&gt;You can buy additional nozzles for other family members but aside from the included travel case with this unit with one head there is no additional storage for floss heads.</li>
            <li> I chose this Sonicare Airfloss Flosser because I&#x27;ve enjoyed Sonicare products in the past and I thought this would be a good complement to my regular dental hygiene routine. I floss daily because it makes my teeth and gums feel healthy, but this flosser is a good second line of defense to make sure I get all the areas between my teeth. I also recently found that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a great option for when there is a super contagious stomach virus going around our house and I don&#x27;t feel entirely comfortable putting my fingers in my mouth to floss lest I get the virus in my system. I can use this flosser instead and feel it&#x27;s more likely that I won&#x27;t get sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the flosser is easy. Either mouthwash or water can be poured into the reservoir and it shoots out in a gentle stream when the button is pressed. It&#x27;s not streaming too hard, but just enough to feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done. The whole process reminds me a lot of the Waterpik I used many years ago when I had braces. The unit is comfortable to hold and keeps its charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust this as a good alternative to flossing, but it has its place. It&#x27;s a good complement to flossing or better than not flossing for those times when you might worry that your hands can&#x27;t be cleaned well enough to be germ-free and you don&#x27;t want to risk getting sick.</li>
            <li> I am not a flosser, never have been, and never will be. This is my compromise with my dentist. It works well, but not perfectly. There is definitely room for user error to become an issue in how accurately this works. That being said I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;I typically use mouth wash and do a couple of pumps between each tooth. This leaves me feeling very minty. Unfortunately, the little reservoir is not quite large enough to do your entire mouth like this so I do end up having to refill it about half way through. I always seem to make a mess if I try to fill the reservoir to the top in the way of it splashing out when I close the little door.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a month I can say it is worth using. I do still find stuff between my teeth, but the majority of it is gone. I&#x27;m hoping for the price it will last a long time and make it worth such an investment.</li>
            <li> It seems that, yet again, the battery is inadequate. I will try the product for some more time but it looks like it is going on the same negative direction as my sonicare toothbrush and the glosser&#x27; predecessor also by Philips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy for me to clean and keep my mouth fresh within 1 min, I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent flosser and does a good job. It is well designed.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s parents bought him this, but he never used it. When I got braces, he gave it to me. It&#x27;s perfect for braces. Fossing is really difficult and time consuming with the wires. I usually finish flossing in under 2 minutes with this.</li>
            <li> Flossing has never been so much easier ! This product comes highly recommended and clinically you can notice the results after a few uses. Compact and portable ! This is a must have for oral health ! As a dentist, I highly recommend this product to all my patients. What beautiful results I see! Dr. Alexandra Chan Katz, Chappaqua, NY</li>
            <li> I have never found a better flosser.  The Philips Sonicare Air Floss has proven itself over and over.  My dental hygienist had me purchase one for her, as my gums and teeth have never looked better, and I&#x27;m 70 years old, with no dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the Airfloss does have a tendency to die, either from hard water (I recommend that it be used with a periodontal preventive rinse) as the one that I use has lasted, but my wife&#x27;s has not.</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and had high hopes for this, but it exceeded my expectations. I had always imagined that an air or water pick would not be as effective as floss. They are not even c9lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nighttime tooth cleaning routine now leaves my teeth very nearly as clean as when I see the dentist. I start with my Philips Sonicare toothbrush with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Cinnamon-Clove toothpaste. I then use the Philips Flosser filled with ACT mouthwash. As a final rinse I use Oraltonin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will end by saying that one thing I learned from using this is that simple flossing doesn&#x27;t do as thorough a job of cleaning as you might think. But the Philips Sonicare flosser in conjunction with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is better than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s the best for flossing of all sold. I&#x27;m still getting used to the tendency to spew all over my countertop and mirror. But I&#x27;m glad I own one. This brand was recommended by my dental hygienist after a $500 periodontal cleaning, so I was motivated to buy one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to floss- I just think it&#x27;s gross.  So I got this thinking it could be a replacement for flossing.  No, it is not.  I used it for 2 months and then used floss again.  Bleeding all over the place!  So I would add this to a daily routine with normal flossing, not a substitution.  It does leave you mouth quite minty.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It did not work.  This is the second one I purchased (from a different store) that was defective and had to be returned.  The one I wound up with is fine and I like it, but I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is good for those times you want to floss with mouth wash or just air puffs. Also for those pop corn bits that get stuck in your teeth. It shoots air between your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use. The pressure point that activates the pulse spray can not always be found.  When it does work it does a great flossing job.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing. I never remember and am not too good at it sooo this little number&lt;br /&gt;helps get the job done.</li>
            <li> This product looked great. I received it as a gift.  After about 5 uses the switch became unresponsive. I returned it and it was promptly replaced.  The new one worked great for about 5 uses and the switch once again became unresponsive.  A friend who purchased one had the same issue. I am very  disappointed. I will try to return once again but I am unconvinced a 3rd replacement will make me happy.</li>
            <li> I tried water pic and it was all over the place. This I&#x27;d simple and you can Dee and feel the difference after using.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for people who don&#x27;t like to floss. it doesn&#x27;t take much time &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so great.  I use it 2-3 times a day.  Even after regular flossing, this dislodges tiny bits of material.  And with the mouthwash, it keeps my breath feeling fresh for much longer than just brushing.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but I am guessing she is going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> New concept, works very well.  Needs refilling too often, and the well is a biatch to refill without spilling - but if you have problems with floss it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t floss regularly, this is the ticket.  You can feel real improvements in less than a few months.  Can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist &amp; see her face.</li>
            <li> This product broke after six months, apart from that we were very happy with its performance. I called Amazon who directed me to Phillips as it was purchased back on Jan 2014 and it is now Sept 2014. Anyhow the customer service young man at Phillips was very helpful and understanding had my replacement sent out immediately and we were back in action within a week. Their customer service was a hundred percent. Could not ask for better service.</li>
            <li> OMG, I&#x27;ve had a couple pockets my last 2 dentist visits that would not go away. My dentist recommended this and the pockets on my back molar healed since I started using it. I&#x27;ve noticed a fresher difference in my mouth. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about these contraptions but I&#x27;m sold. I would like to see a combination of this, a toothbrush, and razor on one charger. Outlets are at a premium in most bathrooms</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great for travel</li>
            <li> I got this for my family, it cleans pretty well but it&#x27;s really powerful, so don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good idea if you have weaker teeth, maybe ask your dentist before you get it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough. Literature claims reservoir is large enough for 1 or 2 uses. Maybe I just like to splash a lot but I have trouble doing all my teeth w/o refilling in the middle. Seems to do a fine job of cleaning but I&#x27;m still weighing the Airfloss against my longtime buddy, WaterPik.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this because the pockets in my gums had become a little too deep.  After using it nightly for 6 months, my gums were greatly improved at my next cleaning.  Using the Airfloss is easier and faster than flossing, and I immediately developed the habit of of using it daily, whereas I would blow off flossing often enough that my gums were affected.  If you already floss daily you may not need this, but if you have trouble making yourself floss every day, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this water pik, it works well with my teeth implants.</li>
            <li> stopped working after only 4 months of use</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. I purchased second nozzle so my husband can use it too. You can feel it doing good.</li>
            <li> As with others, the IDEA might be good, but the way this works is ineffective.  It doesn&#x27;t floss properly.  I have been using a Water-pic for years and wanted to try this because the Water-pic is messy.  I thought that this would be better, but after using it, I find that it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented several times by using the Airfloss and then cleaning the washbowl and putting the stopper in.  Then I would use my Water-pic and I found that every time, there was debris from my teeth in the bowl after the Water-pic had done its job, sometimes quite a bit.  I made sure that I was giving the Airfloss a fair chance by being very careful and going over every space two or three times until the reservoir was empty and still got debris with the Water-pic.  I have a bridge with two teeth missing and flossing under this is easy and complete with the Water-pic, but the Airfloss just doesn&#x27;t seem to work in these spaces.</li>
            <li> Battery does not recharge.  Wasted half an hour with Sonicare customer service - they needed serial number, model number, etc.  Then there they went through the list of trouble shooting questions, including some questions that were beyond comical.  Gave up and returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well run and very comfortable, very clean teeth cleaned. The capacity of the tank is too small.The capacity of the tank is too small.</li>
            <li> I had it for a month now. But today was the first time I have used it. It is different, it is not like a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34;. The water does not stream out of the tip. When you push the button on top the nozzle will blow out a strong puff of air, along with a small jet of water or mouth wash. The jet of liquid is enough to dislodge  almost anything between the teeth..&lt;br /&gt;I DO like it better than a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; which I have two of.&lt;br /&gt; There is one item that they should tell you thought.&lt;br /&gt;In buying mouthwash if you use it with the flossier be careful not to buy mouthwash containing &amp;#34;ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE&amp;#34; as it will damage the &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare Airfloss&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I will be checking back in a month to let you know how I REALLY feel about the Airfloss.</li>
            <li> This device is totally awesome. Great and fun way to floss.</li>
            <li> Seller is good and got item very quickly. Item is working very nice</li>
            <li> Have used unit for about 3 weeks.  Units works OK.  I do wish it had a little more power behind the discharge of liquid  (mouthwash) used in the flossing.  Also, the liquid reserve could be larger.  I have found that the unit barely holds enough liquid (mouthwash) to complete one round of flossing.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I have gone from never flossing to using it every day. Well worth the money. Your teeth and your dentist will thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife and I purchased this flosser and liked them. After 3 months, the trigger mechanism on both units stopped working. Philips was great and replaced both units. Mine worked for 5 months, but now the unit will not recharge. My wife says that her unit is working for shorter and shorter periods of time between recharging. While I liked my flosser, I hesitate to get another one because of the problems we have had.</li>
            <li> I got this before in a  periodontist&#x27;s office and it was recommended to me since I have gum problems.  It really does help getting food particles out between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Recently, I bought a Sonicare Air Flosser. I have used the Oral B water flosser for several years and though I liked it very much I found the design bulky.  Plus, being a fan of the sonic are toothbrushes I assumed their product would be an upgrade.  It is like I threw my money away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today to test it again I ate some popcorn and then used the air flosser.  All in all, gargling with water was more effective at getting the stuff out of my teeth.  For the expensive price I just expected more.  I am kicking myself cause I threw out the box assuming it would be much much better than the Oral B.  It isn&#x27;t and now I am just stuck with a useless bit of technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I floss after using the new air flosser and can&#x27;t believe the stuff regular floss removes that this useless invention doesn&#x27;t even touch.  I am positioning it correctly -so that&#x27;s not the issue.  Also the water chamber that is billed as lasting 3 uses only lasts for half my mouth and I am not a mutant with double the teeth.  DO NOT BUY this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After writing this review, I called Sonic care and they have a 45 day return policy -even if you no longer have the packing materials or the box.  Excellent...</li>
            <li> Best tool to clean teeth with or without braces.</li>
            <li> Use it ,its very much!</li>
            <li> This review is a reprint from one I left for the 2-Pack I bought for my parents as a Christmas gift, but I&#x27;ve owned an Airfloss for a couple years now. These things are amazing, and in my case, corrected problems with my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use alcohol-based mouthwash in mine, and in very little time my &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; under my gums began to shrink. In some cases I went from a 6 to a 2. Sorry for the dentist speak, but if you have this problem you probably know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS which I use in conjunction with the Philips Sonicare Airfloss. Both serve a purpose, but too me have a different mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prep for brushing with the Waterpik. It gushes a lot more fluid than the Airfloss so using mouthwash is not practical. After I Waterpik, I brush, then I finish with the Airfloss, and then a final rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I have dropped off how much I use traditional floss, but the current routine seems to get me good reviews every time I see the hygienist. In fact, after she noticed my pockets were shrinking, and she realized it was from the Philips she went and bought one, and now recommends the Philips Airfloss to her clients.</li>
            <li> Dentist advised against using it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to give as a gift for my partner and his dentist advised against using it if he was  flossing correctly. It could cause damage to gums.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth I use the flosser and it really cleans between the teeth and makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good product until it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 60 days of using this it no longer charges. I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of damaged rechargeable battery cells or if water somehow leaked into the electrical circuit. There is really no way to open and examine without destroying the unit since it&#x27;s very much a product of the &amp;#34;Disposable Generation&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between teeth most of the time. Sometimes you still have to use real floss and of course that doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much to replace when it breaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this does a better job when you have a tiny bit of space between your teeth. If you have spots where even thin floss barely makes it through then the Airflosser will make a loud noise signaling no water (or mouthwash) is making it out of the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I preferred using a 50/50 water and mouthwash mixture solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend it, but keep your box and warranty near by!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give special mention to Amazon, who replaced ours even though it was a bit over the return window. They go above and beyond sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try and update this review if we have any issues with the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 03/18/2015&lt;br /&gt;************************&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Air Flosser when I noticed the unit stopped shooting out mouth wash with the air. I drained it and ran some warm water into the reservoir. It didn&#x27;t help, then I noticed it stopped shooting air as well. I tried a few more times and heard a loud **POP!!** and felt something hit me in the glasses. It was the rubber button + hard plastic connectors. Luckily I was wearing my glasses or else it would have hit me right in the eye!&lt;br /&gt;It hit my lens hard enough to leave a mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the button that flew off at me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When contacting Philips I was asked if I had dropped the unit, which I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;From what I could gather from other comments, if anyone says they dropped it, even just a few inches, they refuse to honor the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a replacement on the way and will keep this updated if anything else should happen to my THIRD REPLACEMENT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/11/2015&lt;br /&gt;************************&lt;br /&gt;Well. Now we have another defect on our hands. We use this product very gently and are extra careful to only have water touch the reservoir. So this one has to be replaced as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 01/20/2016&lt;br /&gt;************************&lt;br /&gt;Here we go again!... We used this maybe 10 times before the charging light went out and never came back on again!&lt;br /&gt;At least this seems to be a DIFFERENT problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to think Philips has no interest in actually fixing the flaws with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always ask &amp;#34;Have you dropped this or submerged it in water?&amp;#34;. Oh course I haven&#x27;t, but who would actually admit to if it they had?&lt;br /&gt;They should be asking their product development team &amp;#34;how can you make a product which doesn&#x27;t die in a matter of weeks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried explaining that these have a high rate of defects and they denied it. I suggested they take a look at the Amazon ratings to see for themselves.I do have a replacement on the way and will keep this updated if anything else should happen to my THIRD REPLACEMENT...   *********************** UPDATE 11/11/2015 ************************ Well.

            <li> can&#x27;t figure out how to use it, you probably need an engineering degree&lt;br /&gt;should have returned it a long time ago</li>
            <li> We have had three of these fail.  one jammed.  another just quit working a third works, but the tip no longer clicks in and its therefore useless.  One we had replaced under warranty and the replacement failed within a year.  I would avoid these - or make sure you save your receipt.  Philips will not replace them under warranty without the receipt - even if you register the product at time of purchase on their website.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use than manuel flossing or using a Waterpik.  I used my first one 2 years and then it would not recharge so I bought a Waterpik  ( too messy) and then an Oralirrigator by Toilet Tree (too messy and hard to aim on the bottom teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am back to the Sonicare Airfloss.  Worked great for about a month then it developed a small crack just below the water reservoir.  I called the customer care service number listed in the booklet enclosed with the product.  I was told to wait for a new Airflosser which should arrive in 2-3 days and use the enclosed label and the box the new Airflosser came in to return my cracked Airflosser.  No hassle what so ever.  The new Airflosser arrived and I returned the cracked one.</li>
            <li> My son had brought his AirFloss for me to try, as I have special needs when trying to care for my teeth. Since I can&#x27;t stand for brushing my teeth, nor can I get close to a sink when sitting on my rolling walker. I was having a hard time trying to keep my teeth clean. With nerve damage to my right arm, and neuropathy in both hands, the waterpik I was trying to use was making a HUGE wet mess every time. Impossible to use!&lt;br /&gt;This AirFloss unit seems to be the answer for me. I just used it after my lunch while I was sitting in my lift chair in the livingroom. I can keep a small plastic cup by my chair for the small amount of fluid the AirFloss produces. PERFECT!  The unit did get the areas between my teeth clean in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I am so relieved to have something I can use more than once a day along with brushing with an electric toothbrush to help with my teeth. Using floss by hand was so difficult with the impaired use of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I did read ALL the reviews, so know that there is a possibility the unit may fail, but I have registered on-line and have uploaded my purchase receipt to the registration page, so will just make use of the long warranty if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased with how the AirFloss works, and look forward to what my dental hygienist thinks when I go next time. She is aware of my many physical limitations and has tried to find ways to help me. I am thankful Sonicare offers an easily used unit!</li>
            <li> Fast service and a great product.</li>
            <li> Quite a powerful blast. Pretty darned good but I still occasionally use regular floss.</li>
            <li> everything broke, then it stopped working...</li>
            <li> We bought this for my son when he got braces because flossing is difficult. He tried this twice and on the second try it cut his gum open. So now it just sits. I don&#x27;t know what to do with it, I guess I will just through it away. Just like tossing cash in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best floss more convenient, the only bad side about it was I used to own one but after using it for more than 3 months it just broke I tried to e-mail the company for the warranty did not get any answer. Hopefully this one will last</li>
            <li> FAIR, AT BEST.  WAS DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT.  DOESN&amp;#34;T APPEAR TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY REPLACE REGULAR FLOSSING WHICH IS A BOOR.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this does not get the job done. Many dentists recommend it because of the Sonicare name; definitely hasn&#x27;t lived up to that name. A quick google search will render a class action suit for this product. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying, merely a toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either you floss, or you don&#x27;t. This product isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I would&#x27;ve found this years ago. Like most, I hate flossing; messy and floss shreds. This is so quick and easy, and I&lt;br /&gt;feel like it cleans as well if not better than floss. You do still need regular floss as this will not get stuff out below the gumline. Bought one for my 81 year old mother&#x27;s birthday and she said it was the best gift ever! She also wishes she had this years ago.</li>
            <li> Batteries die. I had two that I bought from Costco in a two pack -  BOTH of them died not long from each other!</li>
            <li> At first water just splashed  all over me when I used it.  After trying it for a while I finally got the hang of it.  You have to figure the angle to press it against your teeth.  It works really good once you get that.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> If you leave water in this device or if you don&#x27;t clean the head after every use you invalidate the warranty. It worked 1-2 months, not very well. Didn&#x27;t charge well and is now useful. No one can repair it, total waste of $80. I have never been more disappointed in a product in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this.</li>
            <li> Flossing does much better.  Flossed after using and there was still food between my teeth.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but after that it&#x27;s easy and so much better that string.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - It doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  Get a water pik instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped this product might be good, but it was a complete disappointment.  The main problem appears to be the battery and the execution of the &amp;#34;air flossing.&amp;#34;  The battery doesn&#x27;t pack enough punch for the air flossing to do anything.  Tiny puffs of air don&#x27;t seem to clean anything, and if you use dental floss after &amp;#34;wind flossing&amp;#34; you quickly realize how little cleaning is actually taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the documentation it indicates that it doesn&#x27;t replace actual flossing, so I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is.  In the end, it&#x27;s a great idea but it just doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Complete waste.  If it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; product I would return it.  Absolute, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never had any doubt that a Sonicare product would work well for me.  It has.  I think I read in another review that the flosser was only intended for the front teeth.  What I remember reading was that the flosser was only meant to be used from the front end of the teeth; in other word, not from behind the teeth.  I have braces so this is much quicker than flossing.  I place the nozzle between my teeth and the burst of air and water really cleans out the spaces between my teeth.  Just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t being fooled I brushed and then I flossed.  Once I was finished I started using the Airfloss.  It removed a lot of additional debris that I probably couldn&#x27;t reach very well with floss.  I have been very serious about my oral health for many years and this product is great.  Personally, I don&#x27;t feel that it completely replaces floss, but it does such a good job of cleaning that I feel safe just using this as a substitute for a couple days at a time.  My oral hygienist and my orthodontist&#x27;s office always compliment me on my healthy gums and oral hygiene.  Nothing has changed and I&#x27;m still complimented on how clean I keep my teeth and braces.  It&#x27;s not like a traditional water pick so don&#x27;t expect it to be one.  It shoots an airy high-speed blast of water through your teeth. It feels amazingly clean.  It was worth the money to know that I am helping my cause of trying to keep as many of my teeth as possible when I get older.</li>
            <li> Really love this product!</li>
            <li> Bad: If you plan to replace regular flossing with this, don&#x27;t bother. Device only works from outside, air &#x27;pulse&#x27; is too weak, takes too long to recycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: But if you don&#x27;t floss, then this is probably better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing: You&#x27;d be better off buying a Sonicare toothbrush, floss and mouthwash and just using them properly</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it.  Her boyfriend is ordering one for himself.</li>
            <li> My daughter had perfect dental hygiene appointments for the first 11 years of her life.  She was diligent with brushing and flossing.  Then she got braces and it&#x27;s been a struggle ever since.  She brushes - with a timer.  And uses the waterpik that the orthodontist gave her.  But I&#x27;ve found myself needing to pick out food particles that cling stubbornly between the wires and her teeth.  Her gums have gotten red and puffy.  Costco had this item in one of their flyers and I thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first two days she jumped every time she set off the jet and she found that her gums hurt for about a week.  But her teeth have been spotless for the first time in ages!!  Usually the orthodontist has her brush and waterpik after the wire is taken off.  Not this last visit.  There was nothing to clean off that had been caught under the wire.  The dental hygienist was shocked at how much better her gums and teeth looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;ll continue to use this after her braces come off.  I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll go back to physical floss.  But I highly recommend this to anyone who has braces and has problems getting their teeth clean with a brush and waterpik.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this flosser.  I don&#x27;t think it has enough power to do the job I was expecting.  I feel it performs as described but feel that it doesn&#x27;t have the power I was desiring.</li>
            <li> works well but suffer from water ingress. not very well sealed from water</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and plan to get one for my husband.  I use it addition to regular flossing.  I prefer it to the Water Pic.  It is portable and convenient to use.  It recharges quickly.  I use Colgate oral rinse to fill the reservoir.  My dental hygienist noticed the improved oral care too.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that the flosser does not hold much liquid at all, I always have to refill after each floss.  Small but inconvenient price to pay for a good product........not as messy as the conventional water flossers.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- sends a percussive burst of fluid through the interdental gap&lt;br /&gt;- I use it with Listerine rather than water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- as the fluid gets partway used it must be held straight up and down or it starts to pump air&lt;br /&gt;- you cannot set it down while the fluid cap is open (say to open the mouthwash bottle). The &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; side is curved and it will roll over and apill the current content.&lt;br /&gt;- reservoir is more than half used up in a single treatment; effectively you must refill it each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find plenty of evidence on-line comparing this to the WaterPik. Different sites favor one or the other and sound equally convincing. Clearly the reviews were paid for by the vendors. The most honest seem to say &amp;#34;any gadget that gets a patient to pay attention to interdental hygiene is better than nothing; none of them are as good as flossing; since most patients refuse to floss I recommend the gadget.</li>
            <li> You get a good feeling after using this. The liquid container could be a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> My unit has quit taking a charge after only 6 months.  Unfortunately, I only had one month to return it to Amazon.  I like the unit, just unhappy with it&#x27;s short time functioning!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I like this very much. However I feel the price is twice what it should be.</li>
            <li> Apologies to the designer, but I can&#x27;t find anything good to say about this outrageously overpriced machine.  The so-called automatic pulses have an unnecessary pause between them, and they hit the teeth like a little hammer with an unpleasant amount of force.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could like this non-user-friendly contraption.  I have returned mine and ordered a different brand with more options.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic. I&#x27;ll never be without one.</li>
            <li> Waterpik hands down the best. This is a joke.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Bought one for my wife and I and we both love this. Better than floss and gets food out that nothing else can.</li>
            <li> REFERRED TO THE SONICARE BY DENTIST.  NOT AT ALL LIKE THE WATER-PIC.  EASY TO USE AND VERY LITTLE TIME.  WHEN HOME, USE IT AFTER EVERY MEAL.</li>
            <li> I bought this at dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I have used it a couple of times a day for two months.  Never thought it did much, flossed first anyway, messy.  First the flap holding the mouthwash broke off, only partially able to return to functioning.  Now the air wand has starting leaking and spraying mouthwash all over my face, on the mirror, big mess.  Going in trash.  Not worth effort to try and get a replacement as the thing accomplishes almost nothing in the dental hygiene department.</li>
            <li> Retuned. Once the fine print was available.to read.regarding the.operation..</li>
            <li> Great buy....quick delivery.</li>
            <li> the sound.click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click is bad!</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it flossed, but just quit working within 4 months.  Won&#x27;t  charge.  For the price it should last much longer.  Very, very hesitant to order another due to very poor quality.  Maybe they should have a replaceable battery as to replace with new unit is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the best practical purchase I&#x27;ve made in awhile. I hate flossing, and I neglect it all the time. This Airfloss makes it very easy and quick which makes me not mind doing it. Now I do it every night before bed. If you are not a big fan of traditional flossing and neglect it like I have get this product. Additionally if you have known about this product and have been thinking about getting it all I can say is just pull the trigger you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use once you understand how to use it properly. (I recommend reading the directions first rather than just trying it) Open up the box put the head on, (additional heads can be purchased color coded as well so multiple people can use it) charge it for awhile, fill up the reservoir with water or mouthwash it doesn&#x27;t take that much, and you&#x27;re good to go. It takes a few times to get used to the way it&#x27;s meant to be used, but once you get that down it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product if you want to save time or hate traditional flossing. Don&#x27;t forget to register for the warranty and make sure you read the direction!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;works&#x27; between some of my back teeth, but my front teeth both top and bottom are more crowded, and this stops Airfloss in its tracks. If you have ideal spacing between teeth, the I think I could see this being more effective. Also, it doesnt store as much fluid as I thought. It claims to have 2 uses or 2 days worth (I forget) but i needed to refill after 1 and 1/2 uses (tried to make this work every day for a week, then gave up. I will convert this to a finger nail cleaner or load it with engine greaser or something until it dies).</li>
            <li> I also was pleased with this product, however, agree the pressure shooting into my bridge was like a &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t usually write reviews but have this product since December and paid less than $70 for it - now it is completely dead and price has skyrocketed!</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended flossing every time i wen. It never happened. Someone once told me learning to floss regularly is harder then quitting smoking. This makes it easy. I fill it with mouthwash and use after I bush at night. Only complaint is I wish the reservoir for water/mouthwash was a bit larger. I tend to use it all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my sister n law told me how good it works.  It seems to be working well and easy to use.  Gets more out between the teeth than regular floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for three days now.  I like the results when I&#x27;m finished with this nightly chore, but my medicine chest mirror is always splattered from the liquid in the reservoir.  Maybe I have to improve my technique.  As others have commented, it would be better if it held more liquid.  I&#x27;ve been using mouthwash in the gadget, and I like the results.  An air-flosser was recommended by a dental hygienist when I complained that conventional flossing was difficult and even painful for me because of an arthritic hand and shoulder.  She was right; this is so much easier.  FOLLOWING UP MANY MONTHS LATER: I purchased one of these for our FL home and months later a second one for our CT home. Today  I&#x27;ve downgraded my four-star review to three. The FL flosser just died after having been used for a total of 9 months.  I thought I could replace the rechargeable battery, but that&#x27;s not possible.  The item is warranteed for two years, so I contacted Amazon and was advised to contact Philips directly. That suggestion proved worthless, as I couldn&#x27;t send email to their site, nor could I &amp;#34;chat,&amp;#34; although I made several attempts.  A phone call to their customer-service department was left unanswered, and now I&#x27;m thoroughly disenchanted with Philips at this point.  It&#x27;s a shame because I really enjoyed using the product while it was working.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness- have gotten great gum health reports from my dentist since using it, so even though the engineering is imperfect, I will continue to use it faithfully. My biggest complaint is that it leaks from the wimpy filling flap and from the joint where the nozzle stem attaches to the device. I suppose that to keep the price down, certain sacrifices had to be made. Hopefully they can improve it over time.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended the Airfloss to be used instead of my Water Pik. I like that the Airfloss in quiet and less messy than the Water PIk, I don&#x27;t think that it is getting the job done. I still have stuff between my teeth after using it, so still have to use regular floss, as well. The water in the little reservoir runs out before doing all my teeth, so I have to stop and refill i. The instructions said that the water would last for the whole mouth cleaning&lt;br /&gt;t. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this appliance again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dual-pack and paid close to $100. The idea was for me to have one, and my kid to have one. I was able to use mine around 10x&#x27;s before it stopped working. My kid used his once and then stopped because he didn&#x27;t care for it. For that kind of money, it better last a couple of years. As far as the results went, nothing impressive for that amount of money. A water-pik works better, IMO, and for half the price!</li>
            <li> Have had great dental checkups since started using this 2 years ago. My hygienist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I liked the device. I got it because I had a tooth with gum irritation. It helped.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is that the battery goes dead and won&#x27;t take a charge.&lt;br /&gt;This happened about 8 months after purchase. Sonicare replaced that one free of charge,&lt;br /&gt;but now the same thing has happened with this one after about 2 years. If they made it&lt;br /&gt;so I could replace the battery for $20 that would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;As it is it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle at over $100 and I won&#x27;t  be buying another one.</li>
            <li> This product rocks really. I recommend using liquid Mouthwashes instead of water and you&#x27;ll feel much better. I highly recommend this to whom want to have healthier mouth and better teeth</li>
            <li> After the first few attempts, I finally mastered using this flosser without spritzing most of the bathroom. Now I think it does a fantastic job. With the correct technique it is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK but it is a little messy to use.  If you forget to turn it off you wind up spraying your face and everything else around you!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the dentist office , after a week it stooped working , then I got another and it has stopped working again.  I&#x27;m very upset that this is breaking down like this , I use the water pik which I love and this which was recommended by my dentist . I like it when it works</li>
            <li> Did not find product easy to use  instructions not clear will have to consult with dentist on hoe to use .</li>
            <li> The thing that I have not learned by daily use to overcome is the messiness of the whole operation.  Evidently I have not learned to keep all the media inside my mouth.  Perhaps with time it will be better  But three weeks of daily use is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell me that a twenty four hour charge would last me through two weeks of usage,  It lasted a little over a week.  I have started the routine of using it, cleaning it, putting it back on the charger, daily.  Now it never stops right in the middle of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warranty requires the presentation of a receipt to validate the warranty.  I did not receive a receipt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for travel use because the home dental irrigater I use nightly is larger and heavier. This Phillips Airfloss does not do a comperable job removing small particals remaining after thorough brushing. The design is made for only front surface irrigation and the fill chamber for holding water or mouthwash is too small for thorough cleaning. I did not expect this unit to replace flossing and it does not. I plan to continue to try using this Airfloss when away from home; after one months intermittant use I am unable to rate this higher. I am a three year pleased Phillips electric toothbrush user.</li>
            <li> I have two bridges that I couldn&#x27;t floss. I told my dentist that I just can&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;treader&amp;#34; into the bridge work. She suggested I get an &amp;#34;air flosser&amp;#34;. I had never heard of them.  Although a little expensive, this flosser workes great!!. Just fill it with mouthwash and you not only clean out the spaces in the bridge but you are getting mouthwash protection too.</li>
            <li> conked out after 2 months. this is my second one. first one conked out after 3 months, do not waste your money total waste</li>
            <li> Just loved the Philips Sonicare Airfloss, makes your teeth feel so much cleaner , so easy to use</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 3 years that recently died.  I purchased a new one from Amazon.  It was defective - it did not pulse water.  Amazon has replaced it twice.  Numbers 2 &amp; 3 worked but a charge only lasted for 3 uses vs. the claimed 14 uses.  I give up.  I think it is the best device of its type on the market, but Philips obviously has manufacturing problems.  I might wait 6 months or so and try it again, but for now I am returning it and not ordering another.  I also contacted Philips.  They sent out a replacement unit but it was the old design - like my 3 year old one that died.  I sent it back.  I don&#x27;t know if they were sending out used or refurbished units, but why replace a new design with the old design?  PHILIPS, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.  Thanks to Amazon for the excellent and understanding customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric flosser to go along with a Sonicare electric toothbrush. It works great. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone considering a purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> Great water pick. Easy to use  and love the chamber you can fill with mouthwash or water based on preference.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed. Still need to floss after using this. Not as effective as tradition flossing.</li>
            <li> I love air flossing so much better then floss....Im hoping it last for a few years.....</li>
            <li> It was an interesting idea but poorly built.  I used it one to three times a week.  After three months it completely died!  I think that there was something wrong with the battery.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my dental health.</li>
            <li> The airflows by Sonic are works well</li>
            <li> It was not very effective at all.  After a few uses it just quit working for no discernible reason.  It was promptly returned.</li>
            <li> It is awkward to use and I consider it no more value than a toy. Water Pik is ten times better.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.  My dental hygienist recommend this, claimed it was better than water flossed.  It&#x27;s not!  If I use it without water, it does next to nothing.  If I use water with it, it sprays all over me and the bathroom.  I gave it many tries and still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my mom and she loves it. Very easy to use and makes the teeth a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and the flexing of the nozzles has caused them to split in two. The split looks like it&#x27;s right down a manufacturing mold line.  I called Phillips who at first said just to clean it!  I informed them again it&#x27;s split in two and useless. They simply said these are not covered under warranty. I explained the nozzle hasn&#x27;t been damaged but due to flexiing it&#x27;s split due to a manufacturing fault and they should review the manufacturing process.    All I got back from Phillips was the nozzle wasn&#x27;t covered under warranty but they could send me a one time replacement nozzle and wanted the unit serial number. I was at work and had originally registered the product, so I requested they review my registration. They said the registration doesn&#x27;t have the serial number. I told them the registration specifically asked for the unit serial number so it must be on my record. They abruptly said call back when you have the serial number!  Sounds like the registration is simply a method to get your e mail and bombard you to buy new products    Very poor customer support from Phillips.    UPDATE  It is now October 14, 2014 and the thing has simply quit working. Six months is a very poor return for such an expensive piece of equipment. I did register it so will call the support people but I don&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li> Great item!!  I like it because I can take it anywhere in the house and not be chained to the sink to clean in between my teeth.  For instance, using it while watching TV or after you get in the bed.</li>
            <li> I love this electric flosser.  Whenever I tried to use the standard water irrigator, I would gag and choke most every time.  When I use this Sonicare flosser I don&#x27;t have that problem and I am amazed at the amount of food particles that come from between my teeth.  I have even used it after a regular flossing and still had particles come out from between my teeth.  My mouth feels much cleaner since I have been using this device.  We have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for about 20 years and this is a great addition to their product line.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t practice good dental hygiene practice as a kid, so I got this as somewhat of a new year&#x27;s resolution to improve the state of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have pretty good flossing skills, you can skip this and do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have a horrible gag reflex and I can only floss in between 1 gap at the back of my mouth before I almost puke. Airfloss does take out quite a fair bit of gunk and doesn&#x27;t make me gag. The first time I used it, it did make my gums bleed but after that it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside though, the replacement heads are pretty expensive, and you cannot floss from the back. The automatic burst is also a little bit silly - it is way too slow and you would probably be better off just hitting the button yourself.</li>
            <li> I love it! Not sure if it&#x27;s working until I go to the dentist, but until then....</li>
            <li> Great product.  Second purchase</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work.  Had to return.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, but I tried it.  It&#x27;s handy in that it is not connected to a huge water tank, but you run out of water fairly quickly.  The water comes out in timed bursts...I expected a continuous stream.  I get that with a small water source in the handle you cannot have a continuous stream...would run out of water instantly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband to help with sensitive gums at the recommendation of our dentist, and we both have loved it.  I do wish it were a little bit more stable when installed on the charging base, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged very often.  The replacement heads are pricey, but do seem to last a good long while.  Our dentist stated she saw improvement in my husband&#x27;s gums in just a few months, so I would definitely recommend as an addition to regular brushing and rinsing to help with gum problem!</li>
            <li> Love it- It&#x27;s the second one I own, but unfortunately, the first one only worked about 2 years that&#x27;s why I to purchase another one.  Can&#x27;t live without one .</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  So easy to floss and using the mouth wash makes your mouth feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.Hope it helps my gums. Time will teel. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend,Like i said doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.</li>
            <li> awesome product which gives me floss free. I hate flossing because so messy when doing it and painful so this airfloss is perfect</li>
            <li> this works really well</li>
            <li> The Airfloss works pretty well, but only works from the front of the teeth. It is convenient in that it is a compact cordless design. However, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the other leading product. If you check reviews and professional tests you&#x27;ll find that they prove that out, for both cleaning and gingivitis prevention. We purchased our first Airfloss a little over two years ago. It began malfunctioning about the time the warranty ran out and Philips sent us another one. That one worked about a year then also died. Philips declined to provide another replacement - advising we would have to purchase another. Why would we do that after two died? They aren&#x27;t cheap.......</li>
            <li> I purchased this product new and received it USED!  Still water on the flosser from use, and food particles on the head!</li>
            <li> It only has very short periodic bursts of fluid/air pressure which do not seem to do much - glad I bought it on line &amp; didn&#x27;t pay the asking price in the shops ! I would then have beed vey disappointed.</li>
            <li> Overall this works as intended. After each use my mouth and teeth feel cleaner. It is easy to use and take care of. The only problem I have is the spray back it causes. Not sure how they could even be fixed, but when used on front teeth it causes spray and it will get all over the bathroom mirror. I have minimized this by make sure to close my lips as much as possible but it can still spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that issue I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great does the job easier and better then the waterpik</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and this item makes me want to floss a lot more and take care of my teeth. Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and I found the price to be better that the local stores.  Would recommend the Airfloss.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time, I only wished I&#x27;d started using it sooner. It is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth purchasing.  Does not work as well as regular floss and you end up having to floss the old fashioned way.  I was thinking it was going to be more like the old water pick, but the little burst of water is just not enough to get the job done.  It&#x27;s also messy, lots of water everywhere, although being able to use mouthwash in the reservoir was nice. Save your money and buy regular floss.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good for tooth</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it. It is much easier to use then the water pick I now own. I fell it does not do as good a job as the water pick, but is much  easier to use.</li>
            <li> I had one previous Sonicare airflosser and I LOVED it...... but this one was defective :(  Will send it back and hope to get a better one!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these through a professional trial offer,one for me and one for my mom. After watching the animated video on the website I thought this was like a simple version of a waterpik, just short stream of water at a time instead of a continuous flow. Wrong. It just provides a quick spritz of water mist, no where near enough to be effective @ plaque removal. my mom said she&#x27;d pay for the one I opened and give it a try, but the other sits in my closet, unopened. For a brief moment I thought of getting it out for my daughter who just got braces, decided against it and bought another waterpik. I&#x27;ve even thought of just giving it to a patient but have decided against it. For better plaque and debris removal just get a real oral irrigator. (unless you want to use this while driving down the road... I&#x27;ve seen people brushing while driving... so, why not?)</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as floss.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  My hygienist suggested this.  Love it.  Works great in getting gums clean.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums at all and they seem much healthier than before with regular flossing.  Has worked great for me for several months.  Can use either water or mouth wash/rinse.  Keep your mouth closed when using or it will get all over the mirror.</li>
            <li> Best new product ever</li>
            <li> What in ingenious idea!  I love this...so much more comfortable than regular flossing!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good so far. Only owned it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Its like floss in that even your gums bleed.  But now that I&#x27;ve used it for a month they don&#x27;t bleed, just like you were actually flossing for real.  You know you don&#x27;t really floss.  End the dentist asking if you floss and you don&#x27;t so you awkwardly respond like you actually do sometimes cycle.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare.  I bought the first at my dentist&#x27;s office and liked it so much that I used it after every meal since I work at home.  The push button stopped working after about 3 months.  However, I hadn&#x27;t registered the product or saved the paperwork, so I bought it again from Amazon and this time registered for the current 2-1/2-year warranty when I received it.  This new one is working fine so far.  Unfortunately, there seems to be nothing else on the market that competes with the Airfloss (Water Pik is a different process, I&#x27;ve read).  Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with this one.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a replacement reservoir door:  [...].    Here is the part # 423502059321</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the same reason most others seem to have bought it: Forgetting to floss. However, I didn&#x27;t find any noticeable improvement over using just the Phillips Easy Clean Tooth Brush. However, I doesn&#x27;t take much time to use and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding gums, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if any improvement on my next dental visit in three months.</li>
            <li> It did not have the &amp;#34; flossing power&amp;#34; of one previously purchased. Love one previously purchased.</li>
            <li> I have a dual bridge implant that requires constant attention. My dentist heard about this product and said it was worth trying. The product is just OK. It does an OK job with the &#x27;surface&#x27; cleaning but does not work at all for the deep cleaning (I still need to use floss). I have had some issues with the power button and charging stand. Also it takes twice as long to use this product as you have to clean both the inside and outside of your teeth. The last issue I have with this product is the mess. It is very messy to use. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> The spaces between my teeth were never so clean. I had one gum surgery and will soon have another one.  Phillips electric flosser and also their electric toothbrush are the duo that I need for healthy teeth and gums.  I wish I would have had an electric flosser 20 years ago!  I possibly could have avoided gum disease and receding gums.</li>
            <li> Not so good as expected. Except saving water, I see no advantage against Waterpick&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in mid December was delivered to my son&#x27;s address in Orlando. In February 2014 my visited me and brought the flooser to me in Costa Rica. I used the product on and off and today I tried to use it it DIED ON ME ( possibly of 4-5 month use). and since the seller has 30 day return policy , I can not exchange it. It is so sad that a product like this is not guranteed for full year AS DESCRIBED BY SONICARE. Now I am stuck with a non working flooser and no recoursr for a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;Thisproduct is not what has been advertized, DON&#x27;T ORDER IT YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY.....&lt;br /&gt;i HOPE THAT SONICARE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT , YOU PAY LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE PRODUCT THAT HAS 4-5 MONTH LIFE SPAN. IT IS NOT WORTH IT......</li>
            <li> I have had 2.  Love them until they died within 6 months.  Stick with the WaterPik</li>
            <li> GREAT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li> it does not work when i received it</li>
            <li> I used this for only three weeks before my 6-month dental cleaning, and the hygienist said my gums had improved over the previous visit. I recently received a bridge, and feel this removes food debris as well if not better than threading the floss. My hygienist did comment that not everyone responds as well as I did.  Had something to do with the type of gum tissue you have.  It is much easier to use than the tank flossers.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price!!!  Love the  sonic care Flosser. Easy to use, and something that doesn&#x27;t take long but gives great results.  So much easier than floss!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic help for healthy gums.</li>
            <li> As a one who has suffered from receding gums, and now ione whose condition has not only stabilized but it improved,  I will never be without a Phillips airflosser. I use it with peroxide andor various mouth washes.  My dentist complements me on the improvement in the condition of my gums.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first one died because I was using mouthwash instead of water in it...The manual even stated mouthwash. I got it replaced here through Amazon, and everything so far has been great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t floss and this is the perfect solution for me. I brush well but even so, this gets out stuff I missed....Flossing would probably be more through but using this in my opinion is much better than doing nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill it up after every use and recharge it once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flosser for almost 5 months. It was working great and I got great reviews at my most recent check-up.  A month ago, at the base of the unit, it started cracking. The flosser has never been dropped. Now air is entering the chamber and it&#x27;s not shooting pressure. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Having used the Sonicare system for about a year, I have had to return these units 2 - 3 times.  Each time, it just stopped working but  I was always able to get a replacement of these non-working units.  This last time, it would not stop working - it kept pumping air and would not stop until it ran out of battery charge.  It is now out of warranty.  These units are not user repairable with too many failures.  I would not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The pack was opened before, very obviousely.</li>
            <li> Love it when i first got it. Purchased in February of 2015, lasted until March 2016. Not willing to spend $70 on a flosser that can&#x27;t last longer than that.</li>
            <li> UNIT FAILED 4 TIMES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the results of this unit. But boy, in my experience, these units are prone to failure!!&lt;br /&gt;Original unit bought 8/&#x27;11&lt;br /&gt;failed and replaced 6/&#x27;12&lt;br /&gt;failed and replaced 10/&#x27;13&lt;br /&gt;failed yet again 7/&#x27;14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, Philips replaced my unit twice although the warranty is just one year. They refused to replace my unit the third time. See if the unit lasted some two years, I might tolerate repairing or buying a new unit. However, given such a history, that it fails just around the warrany expiration period, I have NO FAITH that the unit that I buy or repair will last a year! The device is not exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use it everyday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;available to be used overseas</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. This was the second one. The problem from the first one was a crack on the body I got after accidental drop from the sink three times and it stopped working. Had to get a new one. Try not to drop.</li>
            <li> on of the best products I have every purchased.  First one lasted 2 years - can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li> I think Philips is able to design very good products.  Unfortunately, they then fail to produce a product that will last.  I have owned a number of the Philips Sonicare tooth brushes and liked the way they worked.  So, I thought that I would give this Airfloss a try.  My wife loved this product.  But, not long after we purchased it the nozzle started leaking then the spare the provided also started leaking.  A couple of replacement nozzles also didn&#x27;t last long.  After a bit the nozzles wouldn&#x27;t stay in device.  Pressing the trigger would eject the nozzle across the room.  We had to resort to taping the nozzles in place.  That worked for a six or eight weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night the device just stopped working. Pressing the trigger just produces a buzzing sound but no results.  We&#x27;ve owned the Airfloss just six months.  As I said I&#x27;ve owned a number of the Sonicare toothbrushes as well.  I&#x27;ve found that they also don&#x27;t last.  Great designs but they don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for both types of device.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon but I&#x27;m so mad and disappointed in this product that I have to prevent someone else from purchasing. First off, it was awful even when it did work. Painful and unreliable. Even when using it you still need to use floss. Worked for a month or so and was securely packed away during a move and once unpacked it never worked again. It makes a sound when the button is pushed but no water or even air comes out. Biggest regret buying this heap of junk. Shame on you Sonicare! Clearly these are defective and break after a month or so.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work correctly from the beginning.  The area at the top that you press down to activate it would not budge.  I had a identical Phillips Sonicare HX8211/02 from my dentist and loved it but after a year it developed the same problem (the area you press would not move) so I decided to replace it.  I would like to return it for one that is not defective but no receipt came with the product.  How do I go about exchanging it?</li>
            <li> This is the best. Good power and portable</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!! Padded!!</li>
            <li> great while it worked; handle case split after 5 months, water got into the electronics and....&lt;br /&gt;now I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get it repaired under philips&#x27; 2-year warranty.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss is an excellent compliment to brushing and flossing. The three pronged attack is extremely effective against plaque. To date, the Sonicare product is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> very good, fits as expected,thx everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended...just like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> For an oral irrigation device, this is a pretty nice alternative for people that don&#x27;t like flossing.  It does a good job of cleaning in between teeth provided that you don&#x27;t have too much cap work; otherwise, the product isn&#x27;t going to match the cleaning power of a regular flossing.</li>
            <li> Horrible.. I used the waterpick for the longest time but since I liked the sonicare toothbrush, I thought to give it a shot.I HATED IT SO MUCH. It doesn&#x27;t clean well and a complete waste of money. I returned it and bought the waterpick again. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a product that is twice as expensive and not even half as good. I take that back; not good at all</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Works great, dentist even noticed it.  The only problem I had was you must use a mouthwash without alcohol, such as Zero.  Otherwise it will clog up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the research says......but I enjoy using it and certainly have cleaner teeth.  Physical flossing is a hassle to me.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the back teeth. I have a cavity behind a crown I can&#x27;t get fixed until the crown comes of (very expensive proposition) and this works beautifully to get food out of that area. Also cleans other teeth very well. I have been very happy with it since I got it and I also really like it&#x27;s compact size.</li>
            <li> Price was fine. Delivery was as promised. We are happy</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I was skeptical, but my dentist recommended it &amp; I actually find myself using it several times a day - I make sure that I fill it with mouthwash that has no alcohol in it - I read a lot of reviews that you can easily break this.</li>
            <li> Stupid me, I left my almost three year old Airfloss in a hotel room. I had to buy a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest version of the Airfloss is slightly different from the original. The water pressure is slightly less, the pump makes slightly less noise, the water cover snaps closed tighter, and the trigger is easier to press. After using the original for this long, those little differences show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never floss. I hated flossing. I knew I had to floss to keep my gums healthy. I brush my teeth twice a day and just couldn&#x27;t get in the habit of flossing. The Airfloss changed all that. I use this all the time before I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over three years, my checkups have been better. I did find out I&#x27;m not really brushing well enough and have to step up the game a little more. I have taken to running two laps around my mouth with this and my teeth feel a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For somebody that will never floss, me, this is the best thing in the world. Flossing is better for you; it removes more of the bad stuff. However, if you never floss, that doesn&#x27;t do any good. This device got me to take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This airfloss  is great! Works extremely well. I very surprised the first time I used it at how well it cleaned. My girlfriend and I have the same dentist and he recommended it so we each got one and she loves it. A great match to our snooker tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> This product is good if you&#x27;re too lazy to floss. It does remove food debris from between the teeth. For those of us with crooked teeth where traditional floss would get caught up and rip, this is a better option. After two months of using it, the product has replaced regular flossing. I do see a noticeable difference where plague does not build up as much. s</li>
            <li> Stopped working after two uses.  Extremely disappointing product even when it did function. Wouldn&#x27;t buy another tooth care product from them again.</li>
            <li> Every day my mouth is full of blood.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for three weeks. Now doesn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> Totally changed my habit and I love floss now!</li>
            <li> Works well and the results have met expectations.</li>
            <li> Very fragile. The flossing wand promptly broke.Flosses badly.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong force but works as expected and gets my teeth, in between, clean!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice Dental Health Product from Philips</li>
