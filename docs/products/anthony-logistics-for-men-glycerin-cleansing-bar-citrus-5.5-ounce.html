            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, so I don&#x27;t get it all the time, but it is my favorite soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just watch for pricing, because some are slightly more expensive but offer free shipping.</li>

            <li>I have their citrus gel and really like it, these are the same scent.</li>
            <li>star deduction is that its a bit expensive compared to some other products, and even though its a full bar I have been going through it pretty quickly.</li>

            <li> This is the first Anthony product I bought and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  The scent is pleasant and you get a real clean feel when using it.  Just watch for pricing, because some are slightly more expensive but offer free shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the other reviews and in tandem with the [[ASIN:B000VN8K2G Anthony Logistics For Men Astringent Toner Pads 60 count]]. Together they have been doing wonders on my face since I replaced my face wash in the morning with this Cleansing Bar. It smells great and lathers up quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about the first week or so I noticed that the bar was over-drying the skin on my arms and almost making it a bit grimy to the touch because of that. However, I would just use some lotion and would be good to go after that. My skins seems to have adjusted to the soap now as well, so this is not a problem as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only star deduction is that its a bit expensive compared to some other products, and even though its a full bar I have been going through it pretty quickly. Probably will need about 1 bar per month for daily showers. If you aren&#x27;t too worried about the cost, go for it! This thing outshines all the competition (from other soap bars to any body wash).</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. I used to use the Anthony All in One cleanser bar, which worked perfectly for me, and I was disappointed when they stopped making it. I tried a couple of other brands that didn&#x27;t work at all for my combination skin, and I gravitated back towards Anthony products and tried this. This soap foams easily yet is long lasting, and gives me a clean, fresh feeling with no drying or residue. I have combination skin and my skin feels clean for the majority of the day. Using this I have had no blemishes or break outs at all, which had been a problem when trying other brands. This is a perfect all round soap and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money for a great glycerin bar. If ordinary soap dries out your skin you will love this. Been using it for years and years.</li>
            <li> great. refreshing. gentle, citrus fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite soap, I hope we will be able to continue to get it from one source or another.  Great service; keep it up</li>
            <li> good I think this is a good choose. but I think if have same sale is really good.&lt;br /&gt;good good.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this bar. I LOVE Anthony products. I use ton&#x27;s of stuff by them daily. This soap smells amazing. Same citrus scent as all the Anthony line. Gets you very clean without drying your skin. Now for the only flaw. But a flaw large enough for me never to buy this soap again. I keep my soap in a covered soap dish to allow the bar to dry completely after each use. This bar of soap turned into mush in about a week and a half. Felt like Jello. It got so soft i could no longer hold it in my hands without it falling apart. I ended up just throwing away an almost full bar of soap. I will be sticking with Jack Black or Lush bars from now on.</li>
            <li> It has a real strong nice smell to it</li>
            <li> I am getting old and it helps to retain youthfulness just a little longer. So when you have no time, I must make it up with money...</li>
            <li> I did not find any benefit over cheaper glycerin face bars like this one: [[ASIN:B0000AN9L9 Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar Bonus Pack, Original Formula - 6 ea]]</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It smells very nice and he&#x27;s very happy with it. Love that its 100% vegetable based.</li>
            <li> I too saw this product in a magazine article a few years back. It was featured alongside a few other glycerin soaps, some more and some less expensive. I bought this one as it said you could also shave with it. I didn&#x27;t believe it as I have fairly sensitive skin and get razor burn quite easily no matter how good of a wet razor I use. However, this product really did work! I read one reviewer who said it made him break out...the only thing I can think of is that he must have been allergic to glycerin or another random ingredient. Anyone I&#x27;ve recommended this to has absolutely loved it and had no problems. My fiancé even began using it...now, it&#x27;s become a rather expensive habit ;-). In fact, she uses it to shave her legs and other sensitive areas and swears it&#x27;s better than any gel/cream she&#x27;s ever used. We both HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time purchasing any Anthony Logistics products - I think the soap is amazing and look forward to trying more products.  The seller shipped my order quickly and it came as expected.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I received this product within 4 days and it is better than I thought. I love how it makes you feel so clean without any soapy filmy feel to your skin. Try it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap, but for your face, and for men. Light on scent, foams well, seems to clean well too. I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, so I don&#x27;t get it all the time, but it is my favorite soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> So I just got tired of the safe---- and the irish---- and all the other over the counter soaps made for men. I went online and found this guy who reviews mens products, and tried many of the ones he tested, some he liked some not. I found him to be spot on when it came to this soap. I was buying this from a resource on the west coast but there supply sometimes was light, I would buy ten they would ship six. I now buy it through amazon and have no issues. I turned my dad onto this soap and my cousin, and they both now use it exclusively. When I have company stay over they always comment positively about it. Now it&#x27;s pricey, has actually doubled in price since I started buying it, but it lasts and I don&#x27;t need shampoo it does a great job on my reasonably full head of hair. I won&#x27;t use anything else again.</li>
            <li> This is some great soap. I just wish that they didn&#x27;t stop making it!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap that does not dry your skin. I only use this for my face and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have really come to like the brand and most of their products. I have their citrus gel and really like it, these are the same scent. Their ph balanced and fancy shmancy formulas work well with my dryer skin. Cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out, give it a try</li>
            <li> I took other user review recommendations and got this for my face. As a single guy I&#x27;m constantly looking for ways to keep my face clean and breakout free without all the oily girly products out there.  So far this as been awesome and it smells amazing in the bathroom. Very smooth to touch the bar and not hard to wash off. So far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
