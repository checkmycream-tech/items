    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the perfect solution</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for guys with finer waver hair.</li>
            <li>Best pomade I have used.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for the price!</li>
            <li>Good luck washing it out of your hair tho!</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Great for summer as you can swim and still style your hair after without reapplying.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for my Macho hair......</li>
            <li>Although it has a great hold.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>this works great for my pomp/pompadour, wether</li>
            <li>Got warm it up a bit in your palms doesn&#x27;t take a lot.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to style either which is nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and better than Murrays, but if you want to see a good oils based pomade, spend the $15 on a Lockhart&#x27;s Good Grease or Schmiere Hart.</li>
            <li>does not wash out very easily with shampoo though.</li>
            <li>strong hold, nice shine.</li>
            <li>and it was just a huge hassle to work with!</li>
            <li>just wish it had MORE wax.  </li>
            <li>Hold really well and has a great shine.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>However it did hold up through for the day so that was a ok</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and this was more manageable as well.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love dax wave and groom</li>
            <li>This product is okay....</li>
            <li>To me the most important thing for a pomade is the hold.</li>
            <li>I spent alot of money looking for the perfect bottle</li>
            <li>Been looking for a strong product for Curley hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, cheap &amp; trustable pomade.</li>
            <li>I have to use a top coat of a water soluble to get exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>and like my top with a style and sides slicked back aniways its pretty good</li>
            <li>This wax pomade is pretty good has a good wax firm hold and smells goood!</li>
            <li>Overall good stuff</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Both are easy to apply and easy to wash out, and both are heavy&#x27;s with FAR better hold and slickness than Dax.</li>
            <li>Two stars off because there are others in the same price range that I feel worked better for my course hair.</li>
            <li>Great at achieving my medium, thick hair a surfer look.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to make my hair how I want it</li>
            <li>my hair is really curly</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to get the style you want.</li>
            <li>GG has more shine and slickness while Scmiere has more hold, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with either.</li>
            <li>classic.  </li>
            <li>This is very good for you if you have hair thats hard to style with other gels, pomades, or waxes.</li>
            <li>You can use as much of it in as you want and your hair will still be soft.  </li>
            <li>Extremely great hold, but it is difficult to get out of hair.</li>
            <li>he has thick hair and liked it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is tough to apply, doesn&#x27;t have amazing hold or shine, and won&#x27;t keep the stray hairs in.</li>
            <li>Works great and is actually not too difficult to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li>it has a baby soft sent.</li>
            <li>but my hair is still soft on touch.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I might mention is it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have complete control of you hair though.</li>
            <li>Works great and you only need a little, this tin should last me a few years.</li>
            <li>I want high pomp or low</li>
            <li>Compared to the synthetic solutions from Axe and old spice, it does a slightly better job and is less than half</li>
            <li>I ride a motorcycle and it even keeps hold after a full day of riding I apply with my hair fully dry and usually wash out every 2 or 3 days with regular shampoo and conditioner</li>
    </ol>

            <li> my cousin didn&#x27;t like it but doesnt mean its bad its pretty good.</li>
            <li> First used it and used a very small amount, maybe a finger tip amount and rubbed it between my fingers and slid it through my hair</li>
            <li> and ive been using it as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle for daily use.</li>
            <li> You must dry shampoo ur hair, rinse, repeat until all of it is gone!</li>
            <li> and ive finally found it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy, greasy wax, but it works and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> feel like the hold was not strong and it stayed in my hair for 3 day .</li>
            <li> The smell is non-existent &amp; shine is very little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the odor, but it&#x27;s not offensive.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well as other oil base pomades like Murrays but still has all the down sides such as being difficult to remove without shampooing half a dozen times.</li>
            <li> Hard to take out of your hair.</li>
            <li> (: (only bad thing is that its hard to wash completely off)</li>
            <li> Too thick and hard to comb through to style!</li>

            <li> This stuff is tough to apply, doesn&#x27;t have amazing hold or shine, and won&#x27;t keep the stray hairs in. Yeah it&#x27;s cheap and better than Murrays, but if you want to see a good oils based pomade, spend the $15 on a Lockhart&#x27;s Good Grease or Schmiere Hart. Both are easy to apply and easy to wash out, and both are heavy&#x27;s with FAR better hold and slickness than Dax. GG has more shine and slickness while Scmiere has more hold, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with either. Give them a try guys, get away from Dax and Murrays.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price!</li>
            <li> classic.  just wish it had MORE wax.  my hair is really curly</li>

            <li> Hold really well and has a great shine. Good luck washing it out of your hair tho!</li>
            <li> This wax pomade is pretty good has a good wax firm hold and smells goood! it has a baby soft sent. i ordered one for me then another for my lil brother bcuz he has thick hair and liked it. But it seems to not be for everione my cousin didn&#x27;t like it but doesnt mean its bad its pretty good. Im a girl and I have curly wavy hair slicked back on a bun and like my top with a style and sides slicked back aniways its pretty good i might order another can (: (only bad thing is that its hard to wash completely off)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for guys with finer waver hair. I can use it to spike or comb. Love it</li>
            <li> I use this hair dress for ever. It is strong enough to make my hair how I want it but my hair is still soft on touch.</li>
            <li> Got warm it up a bit in your palms doesn&#x27;t take a lot. Overall good stuff</li>
            <li> Great at achieving my medium, thick hair a surfer look. Great price too. Great for summer as you can swim and still style your hair after without reapplying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget the stripping shampoo for it tho or it will stay in your hair for a while</li>
            <li> Works great and you only need a little, this tin should last me a few years.</li>
            <li> First used it and used a very small amount, maybe a finger tip amount and rubbed it between my fingers and slid it through my hair and it was just a huge hassle to work with! Too thick and hard to comb through to style! However it did hold up through for the day so that was a ok plus. HOWEVER to remove it was a nightmare! You must dry shampoo ur hair, rinse, repeat until all of it is gone! i had to wash my hair several times to remove it all! Not worth the hassle for daily use.</li>
            <li> Works great and is actually not too difficult to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my Macho hair...... I used Murrays but I didnt get the hold that I get with Dax. I have wavy hair and this was more manageable as well. I would recommend this product over a water base anyday because of the flexibility, hold, and it just looks great overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best pomade on the market!!!</li>
            <li> A greasy pomade. Hard to take out of your hair. Although it has a great hold. The smell is non-existent &amp; shine is very little. To me the most important thing for a pomade is the hold. So this pomade is a plus for me. You can&#x27;t beat the price, cheap &amp; trustable pomade. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dax for a while as a mustache wax.  It&#x27;s a heavy, greasy wax, but it works and it lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the odor, but it&#x27;s not offensive.  The only drawback I might mention is it is very greasy.  You&#x27;ll need to wash your hands or carry a handywipe if you&#x27;re going to use it.  Note-the can is larger than it used to be-you probably don&#x27;t want to carry it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> This wax is awsome. I love it. Its oil based so it gives an awsome shine and hold. It styles my hair any way i want and ive ordered 5 bottles already. I always get compliments on the shine and the way it holds. I love dax wave and groom and ive been using it as long as i can remember. This is very good for you if you have hair thats hard to style with other gels, pomades, or waxes. I spent alot of money looking for the perfect bottle and ive finally found it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is okay....feel like the hold was not strong and it stayed in my hair for 3 day .</li>
            <li> strong hold, nice shine. does not wash out very easily with shampoo though. You don&#x27;t need a lot to style either which is nice</li>
            <li> Best pomade I have used. You can use as much of it in as you want and your hair will still be soft.  You also don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to get the style you want. Doesn&#x27;t have complete control of you hair though. I have to use a top coat of a water soluble to get exactly what I want. But for the price and how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; my hair stays and feels after I use it. I will come back and buy this every time.</li>
            <li> Extremely great hold, but it is difficult to get out of hair. Will have to use some heavy-duty shampoo to remove. No smell.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a strong product for Curley hair this works great for my pomp/pompadour, wether I want high pomp or low it works and keeps it&#x27;s hold even in sun and humidity I ride a motorcycle and it even keeps hold after a full day of riding I apply with my hair fully dry and usually wash out every 2 or 3 days with regular shampoo and conditioner but Dax does sell a shampoo and conditioner that they recommend, well worth the money</li>
