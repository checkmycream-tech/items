            <li>child perfume, I just love it!</li>
            <li>It is a lovely, light fragrance especially good in warm weather.  </li>
            <li>and they even included nice samples.</li>
            <li>My best friend introduced mt to this in high school and have been wearing it since then</li>
            <li>This is a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>And I love the free samples they send with your order!!</li>
            <li>I get to enjoy a whiff of this unique and beautiful scent because when one wears it themselves, the scent becomes unnoticeable to the wearer, though not to others.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY</li>
            <li>Every woman should have this lovely fragrance in her perfume collection.</li>
            <li>I love this sent</li>
            <li>Child is my favorite fragrance ever, and I purchase it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love the perfime and I am really glad it was not a phony item</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>this perfume and love to have my lady friends put it on as whenever they walk by</li>
            <li>I think 95% of people ordering this will fall in love.</li>
            <li>and men love the smell.</li>
            <li>lovely on everyone</li>
            <li>So glad to see it is still being sold.  </li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with this perfume the moment she tried it on 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Just a beautiful soft smell</li>
            <li>it is so unique!</li>
            <li>She finds it easy to put in her purse when she goes to a more formal occasion.  </li>
            <li>The roll-on makes it easy for travel.</li>
            <li>and it goes on easily anywhere unlike spray bottles</li>
            <li>This is clean, musky, floral and fleshy (for lack of a better term).</li>
            <li>When I think of a &amp;#34;child&amp;#34; they never smell this strong.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like this since i was buying it without smelling it first, but i just love it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy my perfume on a daily basis and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li>Everyone says this scent is fabulous but it reminded me of how my grandmother smells.</li>
            <li>All I can say to guide you is that if you&#x27;re into light floral scents, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s medium rich with maybe under notes of musk.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully clean and fresh.!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Really nice and soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I think it actually started to smell better the more I used it.</li>
            <li>(1 1.3oz bottle lasts me about a year, even with my nightly aromatherapy &#x27;fix&#x27;) and Susan Owen&#x27;s \\&quot;Child\\&quot; perfume oil is worth EVERY PENNY.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Child perfume for over 10 years now, since long before it was easily available.&lt;br /&gt;Child and Coco Chanel are my 2 favorite scents ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right over it.</li>
            <li>or twice, don&#x27;t put your nose right on it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered right away and as soon as i received it I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Everyone stops me and asks what I&#x27;m wearing, and I&#x27;ve probably been responsible for a dozen or more &#x27;new fans&#x27; (can I get a commission?</li>
            <li>Bought without smelling first.</li>
            <li>I massage it in first THEN put my shirt on.</li>
            <li>I first encountered it at heri bendel&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get just as many compliments now as I did back then</li>
            <li>While the smell was really good, it felt a bit too heavy for me</li>
            <li>It smells a little different on every woman who wears it, but ALWAYS delicious... a subtle, soft, lingering and bewitching scent!</li>
            <li>First let me say that beautyhabit shipped my order so fast I</li>
            <li>and I can tell you it certainly does.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy from them again.</li>
            <li>In all, I spent over $250 that first &#x27;try&#x27; at getting my hands on a GENUINE bottle of Child, but it was WORTH IT.   </li>
            <li>Thanks for the hand written card Jackie.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Omg I can&#x27;t really put my finger</li>
            <li>like samples you really want, and the gift certificate to use on&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t use it all that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feminine and very creamy.</li>
            <li>I wore it occasionally but it wasn&#x27;t my go-to scent, and my boyfriend didn&#x27;t love it more or less than my other perfumes.</li>
            <li>The oil formula is strong to slightly overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and seductive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It took me a YEAR to find it, and then via Ebay, where I paid WAY TOO MUCH for a tiny roll-on the size of a lipstick (from a not-so-honest seller who had watered it down!), then finally from a reputable shop in Beverly Hills (Fred Segal).</li>
            <li>She always makes sure that she has at least one bottle in her vanity kit.  </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle yet  still quite potent.</li>
            <li>Really wanted the spray but heard it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really wanted the spray but heard it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous Jasmine Sambac (Pikake) with an undertone and dry down that is difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of the jennifer aniston fragrance which i also like, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as this oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle can really lay it  on thick, so be careful with application.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is unlike any other tropical floral that I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> the don&#x27;t spray when upside down when perfuming all over.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Co-workers have told me they can smell my perfume after I have walked down the hallway.  </li>
            <li> Later, I had to undergo major surgery (car accident, suffered spinal injury and nerve damage), and recuperation was terribly painful, took over a year to get back on my feet.   </li>
            <li> A little goes a looooong way,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> It absolutely drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> I was hypnotized by this scent almost seven years ago, when at a movie (San Diego, visiting friends); it distracted me so much I HAD to ask the lady seated in front of us what she was wearing (my friends thought I was CRAZY).   </li>
            <li> if you are heavy handed, just roll the ball over your wrist&lt;</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming though.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive but it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;could hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is an exclusive, hard to find scent</li>
            <li> It is my secret.</li>
            <li> I like to dab it behind each ear</li>
            <li> and I hate to review it because I prefer it to be my secret.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re disappointed in the scent, I don&#x27;t understand you.  </li>

            <li> The best perfume I have ever smelled on my wife. It absolutely drives me crazy. Just a beautiful soft smell</li>
            <li> This is one of the most beautiful florals that I have ever had the pleasure to own. It&#x27;s soft, feminine and very creamy. It is unlike any other tropical floral that I have ever come across. It lasts all day and people stop me and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing all the time. Every woman should have this lovely fragrance in her perfume collection.</li>
            <li> I love this sent it is so unique! Everyone compliments and ask what the sent is! I love Beauty Habits store! Always 100% satisfied! And I love the free samples they send with your order!! Definatley a must-have and must-save store!!!</li>
            <li> Child is my favorite fragrance ever, and I purchase it at Amazon.com. It has a beautiful floral scent that does not overpower. Yes, it is expensive but it lasts a very long time. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I was hypnotized by this scent almost seven years ago, when at a movie (San Diego, visiting friends); it distracted me so much I HAD to ask the lady seated in front of us what she was wearing (my friends thought I was CRAZY).   It took me a YEAR to find it, and then via Ebay, where I paid WAY TOO MUCH for a tiny roll-on the size of a lipstick (from a not-so-honest seller who had watered it down!), then finally from a reputable shop in Beverly Hills (Fred Segal). In all, I spent over $250 that first &#x27;try&#x27; at getting my hands on a GENUINE bottle of Child, but it was WORTH IT.   Later, I had to undergo major surgery (car accident, suffered spinal injury and nerve damage), and recuperation was terribly painful, took over a year to get back on my feet.   My Child perfume worked MIRACLES on my spirit, though, and it became my nightly ritual to roll a dab on my wrist before going to bed at night, as it helped me through the chronic pain and into blissful sleep.    I&#x27;ve been through five bottles now (1 1.3oz bottle lasts me about a year, even with my nightly aromatherapy &#x27;fix&#x27;) and Susan Owen&#x27;s \\&quot;Child\\&quot; perfume oil is worth EVERY PENNY.   Everyone stops me and asks what I&#x27;m wearing, and I&#x27;ve probably been responsible for a dozen or more &#x27;new fans&#x27; (can I get a commission? LOL).     It smells a little different on every woman who wears it, but ALWAYS delicious... a subtle, soft, lingering and bewitching scent! Makes me feel like I&#x27;m floating on a Magnolia and sugar-dusted Honeysuckle cloud...</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second bottle I have purchased for her. Everyone tells her how great she smells.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the hand written card Jackie.</li>
            <li> I love the perfime and I am really glad it was not a phony item</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever!!!!!  Love love love it!!!  I get stopped and asked what scent I am wearing all the tim.</li>
            <li> Bought without smelling first. Mistake. Everyone says this scent is fabulous but it reminded me of how my grandmother smells. Not the vibe I was going for.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong scent. When I think of a &amp;#34;child&amp;#34; they never smell this strong. The roll-on makes it easy for travel. The oil formula is strong to slightly overpowering.  I could go either way on this product. But will probably not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it. People stop to ask me what perfume I am wearing. It is my secret. Very soft and seductive.</li>
            <li> This is not an overbearing fragrance.  It stays on all day and is sensual but not imposing.  Very nice Spring scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Child perfume for over 10 years now, since long before it was easily available.&lt;br /&gt;Child and Coco Chanel are my 2 favorite scents ever.&lt;br /&gt;The roll on is the best choice and it goes on easily anywhere unlike spray bottles the don&#x27;t spray when upside down when perfuming all over.&lt;br /&gt;Love this perfume and love to have my lady friends put it on as whenever they walk by I get to enjoy a whiff of this unique and beautiful scent because when one wears it themselves, the scent becomes unnoticeable to the wearer, though not to others.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> Really wanted the spray but heard it doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s like $175!  I order this like once a year just die to the price. But this is a 4 seasons all color scent. Yes, I match my perfumes to what I&#x27;m wearing....don&#x27;t judge😂. The roll on is convenient. It is a bit oily so don&#x27;t roll this on n put a silk blouse right over it. I massage it in first THEN put my shirt on. I actually put it all over my legs n then put jeans on. Makes em smell yummy for quite a while. Haha. The scent is subtle yet  still quite potent. Not overwhelming though. Oh I wish I were an expert so I can describe the smell. All I can say to guide you is that if you&#x27;re into light floral scents, don&#x27;t get this. It&#x27;s medium rich with maybe under notes of musk. Omg I can&#x27;t really put my finger I it. If you&#x27;re disappointed in the scent, I don&#x27;t understand you.  I think 95% of people ordering this will fall in love.</li>
            <li> First let me say that beautyhabit shipped my order so fast I&lt;br /&gt;could hardly believe it.  The samples they left me in the box&lt;br /&gt;are like samples you really want, and the gift certificate to use on&lt;br /&gt;my next order, I&#x27;m turning cartwheels over.&lt;br /&gt;About child perfume, I just love it! A little goes a looooong way,&lt;br /&gt;so if you are heavy handed, just roll the ball over your wrist&lt;br /&gt;once or twice, don&#x27;t put your nose right on it.  Move your wrist,&lt;br /&gt;in front of your nose, so you get an intoxicating whiff of child.&lt;br /&gt;  The jasmine in it must be what I&#x27;m drawn to.&lt;br /&gt; I first encountered it at heri bendel&lt;br /&gt;about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using Child perfume for about 10 years now and will never use anything else again.  I get complements on a daily basis.  Co-workers have told me they can smell my perfume after I have walked down the hallway.  It is suppose to attract the oposite sex and I can tell you it certainly does.  I enjoy my perfume on a daily basis and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous Jasmine Sambac (Pikake) with an undertone and dry down that is difficult to describe. This is clean, musky, floral and fleshy (for lack of a better term). The bottle can really lay it  on thick, so be careful with application.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I got this years ago because I saw some infomercial that claimed this was the best perfume ever and men love the smell. I believe some celebrity was promoting it as well. While the smell was really good, it felt a bit too heavy for me and I didn&#x27;t use it all that much. I wore it occasionally but it wasn&#x27;t my go-to scent, and my boyfriend didn&#x27;t love it more or less than my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully clean and fresh.!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent that lasts all day but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Smells lovely on everyone I know who wears it.  Oil adds additional complexity to scent.</li>
            <li> I like that this is an exclusive, hard to find scent and I hate to review it because I prefer it to be my secret. Everyone loves this and I will wear it forever. Had to review in order to give credit to the seller, as the packaging was so beautifully done. They even included a handwritten note, which is uncommon with most web purchases. They also saved me a trip to Bendal when I began to run low! Will certainly buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I wear this because my husband loves it.  It is a lovely, light fragrance especially good in warm weather.  Wonderful seller.  Wrapped perfectly, shipped quickly and they even included nice samples.</li>
            <li> I purchased this years ago and loved it.  Recently thought about this perfume again and did an internet search.  So glad to see it is still being sold.  I ordered right away and as soon as i received it I put it on.  Memories came back.  Now I remember why I loved it so much&lt;br /&gt;Really nice and soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume around. Doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. I get compliments constantly when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> My best friend introduced mt to this in high school and have been wearing it since then (I&#x27;m 35 now)!  I get just as many compliments now as I did back then</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this perfume the moment she tried it on 5 years ago.  Since then she has never parted with it.  She always makes sure that she has at least one bottle in her vanity kit.  The size is not that big but it makes up in scent.  She finds it easy to put in her purse when she goes to a more formal occasion.  Its a must have perfume for women!</li>
            <li> This seems to smell different on everyone. I think it actually started to smell better the more I used it. A little goes a long way. I like to dab it behind each ear so when your hair moves you get a hint of the beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like this since i was buying it without smelling it first, but i just love it.  it&#x27;s fresh and lasts a long time.  it reminds me of the jennifer aniston fragrance which i also like, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as this oil.</li>
