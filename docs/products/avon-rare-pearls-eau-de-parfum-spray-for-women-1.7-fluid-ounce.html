            <li>This is one of my most new favorites.</li>
            <li>thanks !!</li>
            <li>I have bought this perfume ever since it first come out!</li>
            <li>To me, this scent smells like an upscale perfume would, and it would be very nice for everyday and special occasions.</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it the scent is light and very lasting.</li>
            <li>They are not selling Rare Pearls.</li>
            <li>The other sellers may be good but not OSPANEL.</li>
            <li>This is  a sweet and  floral scent, very feminine and pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a soft warm fragrance not too loud</li>
            <li>I want to make a large Rare pearls perfume</li>
            <li>My husband must love it too because he is actually the one who bought it for me!</li>
            <li>Product was Avon product, full bottle, new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have had a lot of positive comments about the scent.</li>
            <li>T wore this perfume in high school still smells the same l love it.</li>
            <li>Does not smell strong enough to carry at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains pure heart of magnolia and plum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>STAR , THANKS.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>bought this for my friend as a gift she loves it so much</li>
            <li>This has never been offensive to anyone that I&#x27;ve been aware of, and it makes me feel fresh and totally feminine.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from the seller OSPANEL and received a perfume that came in a damaged previously opened Rare Pearls box and smelled like cheap mens cologne.</li>
            <li>I chose this because the description of the scent sounded soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, I was very happily surprised.</li>
            <li>a classic for me</li>
            <li>I have bought Rare Pearls through local Avon sellers for over 5 years and it does not smell like this junk.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty scent, and is not a heavy perfumey fragrance like some other scents I have tried.</li>
            <li>Trust me, if you don&#x27;t like this scent, then I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for in a soft feminine perfume.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 84 year old mother in law as a christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time around groups of seniors who can be sensitive or even upset by perfume.  </li>
            <li>That was such a surprise to me, I have such a hard time getting any kind of perfum to stay on me, even if I spray it on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I paid for and expected.</li>
            <li>I have tryed ever trick in the book, even sprayed  so much on my clothing that I became wet.</li>
            <li>If someone tells you this stuff smells good, they&#x27;re a bad friend.</li>

            <li> If you like the smell of mold, dead roses, and sweat, this is the scent for you.  </li>
            <li> and it was a gift for someone I am not happy about this at all</li>
            <li> She hated it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this perfume a lot.!</li>
            <li> I used it before. My boyfriend likes it. That is why I bought it one more and I think I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great transaction, fast service. Got this perfume for soooooooooo much less then from Avon directly with no avon rep bothering me. Will absolutely order form this vendor again. :)</li>
            <li> I love it! &amp; get a lot of compliments:)</li>
            <li> This Rare Pearls perfume is even better than the Rare Diamonds. Both are great, soft and pretty. But Rare Pearls is even better and more gorgeous. This is one of my most new favorites. Absolutely great smell. Trust me, if you don&#x27;t like this scent, then I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for in a soft feminine perfume. It&#x27;s Good stuff! Great price too. Get it.</li>
            <li> This product is the same as you purchase from Avon and at a much less cost to the consumer.  I will purchase the item from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, and the fragrance lasts a while too!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 84 year old mother in law as a christmas gift.  The scent is nice and she seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> Came as described, I love  it</li>
            <li> After switching favorites for years, I&#x27;ve settled on this one.  Most scents don&#x27;t work with my chemistry.  A few floral combinations or single floral scents are good to excellent on me, but this one always gets compliments.  Combined with the body lotion and shower gel, it&#x27;s even better.  I spend a lot of time around groups of seniors who can be sensitive or even upset by perfume.  This has never been offensive to anyone that I&#x27;ve been aware of, and it makes me feel fresh and totally feminine.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the speedy delivery.  Love this perfume and I was not disappointed.  I will buy this again.  My husband must love it too because he is actually the one who bought it for me!</li>
            <li> Was a gift. She loved it.</li>
            <li> Love, love. Love! Very pleased with product and with seller.  Product was Avon product, full bottle, new bottle.  No negatives.  Just spray and enjoy the complements!</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume , my wife likes it very much ,will buy more avon products.i would recommend to anyone who wants good quality perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my wife. She hated it. It smells like a heavy cologne.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an everyday scent because I have an expensive perfume that I received as a gift and use for special occasions. I chose this because the description of the scent sounded soft and pretty. When I used it the first time, I was very happily surprised. It is a very pretty scent, and is not a heavy perfumey fragrance like some other scents I have tried. To me, this scent smells like an upscale perfume would, and it would be very nice for everyday and special occasions. I have also received many complements and many \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot; questions. When I start to run low on this fragrance, I will definitely be purchasing another bottle!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of mold, dead roses, and sweat, this is the scent for you.  A woman that works in the office wears the stuff and it gags everyone.  I ended up buying it as a prank to get someone back that pranked me.  If someone tells you this stuff smells good, they&#x27;re a bad friend.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me one year, I was so amazed over the comments that I received when I wore  &amp;#34;Rare Pearls&amp;#34;. That was such a surprise to me, I have such a hard time getting any kind of perfum to stay on me, even if I spray it on my clothes. I have tryed ever trick in the book, even sprayed  so much on my clothing that I became wet. With this perfum one spray and I good for the day. Try it you will love it the scent is light and very lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY , THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT I WANTED.&lt;br /&gt;5 STAR , THANKS.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY , THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT I WANTED.&lt;br /&gt;5 STAR , THANKS.</li>

            <li> My most favorite perfume!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and it&#x27;s still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I paid for and expected.</li>
            <li> bought this for my friend as a gift she loves it so much it&#x27;s all she wears now!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from the seller OSPANEL and received a perfume that came in a damaged previously opened Rare Pearls box and smelled like cheap mens cologne. I have bought Rare Pearls through local Avon sellers for over 5 years and it does not smell like this junk. When I contacted the seller they said it was the correct product and refused to refund. They are not selling Rare Pearls. It is a scam. Do yourself a favor and buy from real Avon sellers or at least try a different seller on Amazon. The other sellers may be good but not OSPANEL.</li>
            <li> Hello I was very disappointed bc I really love this perfume when it got to my house the box had been opened and the perfume had been used I have not contacted sooner because I did not know how to notify anyone and it was a gift for someone I am not happy about this at all</li>
