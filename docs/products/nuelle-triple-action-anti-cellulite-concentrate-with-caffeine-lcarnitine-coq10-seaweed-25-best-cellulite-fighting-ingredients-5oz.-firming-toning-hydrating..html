            <li>Kind of wigs my dogs out!</li>
            <li>So It was like about 3 months ago that I decided to commit myself to exercising, drinking more water, eating healthier and LOOKING FOR THE BEST CREAM to get rid of cellulite....</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to reduce the appearance of cellulite and this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>i have tried many cellulite creams and find this one to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have found what works for me!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn but it almost feels like you have a warm heating blanket on!</li>
            <li>I have tried many anti-cellulite creams (including the \\&quot;the best seller\\&quot; finulite... what a scam!!)</li>
            <li>It works and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li>Impressive list of healthy ingredients that work.</li>
            <li>I felt absolutely confident that my body looks great!</li>
            <li>Very good smell, and perfect consistency for a quick massage with no residue.</li>
            <li>After reading all the wonderful reviews I was very excited when I received my product.  </li>
            <li>Cellulite has never been something pleasant to look at or have –</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, but it not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>On top of it the price is very good, it comes in a discrete packaging and</li>
            <li>I love it, smells nice and does the perfect job!</li>
            <li>It smells great and applies nicely.</li>
            <li>Size is good too.</li>
            <li>did my research and after trying another product for 2 months, I didn&#x27;t get any good results ....  </li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good cream.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Its as good price, too.</li>
            <li>Cellulite runs in my family, and after the good results I even bought one for my sister</li>
            <li>It smells really good and works.  </li>
            <li>One good thing about it is it smells good.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like I am getting a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Of course like everything you have to help the product having a good diet and doing some exercise.</li>
            <li>I tried it because of all the good reviews it got; but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it also smells good.</li>
            <li>It has great smell, nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I saw as good of a result.</li>
            <li>nothing good to say, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>But, no matter how good I am, I always have some cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I think NuElle cellulite cream is a good product.</li>
            <li>Like I said, not a miracle product, but still is good if your cellulite isn&#x27;t too</li>
            <li>This product is really good.</li>
            <li>Even after a gap of 2-3 weeks it still looks good.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients and incredibly effective product.  </li>
            <li>I loved the results and I&#x27;m even buying this product for my mother now.</li>
            <li>But it smells good, good consistency and good absorption.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue to use the products and see just how great my legs can look!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s too soon to tell how effective it will be, I can say that the cream is pleasantly fragranced  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Also I was very happy with how quickly the product arrived.</li>
            <li>Great product. :-)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Exercise, diet, massages and healthy life style will pay you off greatly.</li>

            <li>There is an impressive list of all-natural ingredients which includes all the most effective anti-cellulite and circulation boosting extracts I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li>The great smell and easy pump bottle is also a plus.</li>
            <li>If it smells like rosemary mint or something, it would be more pleasant.</li>
            <li>What makes this product even better is the pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The lotion smell good and it leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It took about a month to notice great results, I was fine with this.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li>Combined with Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz I have been getting amazing results.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star because it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>I had honestly given up all hope of any help or cure .</li>
            <li>The lotion does have a nice warming sensation, it smells ‘spa-like,’ and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li>lotion has a nice fragrance and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>but after you get used to it, it is kind of Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to be honest when I say it works.  </li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>If used effectively this product can show signs within 2-3 week of change.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, use everyday - works and smells great!</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>my skin looks thigher (kind of like wearing a pantyhose)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled and will continue to buy this if I keep seeing this difference.</li>
            <li>Nice smell,</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like lemons to me).</li>
            <li>The bottle says it may create a warm sensation, but I didn&#x27;t get anything like that.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say NuElle</li>
            <li>I order this product for my wife, and it works effectively on her skin problem.</li>
            <li>The company really appears to be excellent with customer service.</li>
            <li>I will now use it on my stomach and waist area  and see what kind of results I will get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for skin firming/ anti-cellulite purposes, but it is also an awesome lotion.</li>
            <li>Regardless, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>tube comes with a handy pump</li>
            <li>Feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I&#x27;ll never stop purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>and it did spread nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li>im a workout diet kind of girl, still have cellulites...and tried everithing out there.</li>
            <li>(it reminds me of lemonheads candy) and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I was horrified and have tried all kind of products in the market since.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This cream does a nice job.</li>
            <li>Just the effect of a nice lotion over your skin.</li>
            <li>I am fair and well lets just say that cellulite looks better when your are olive.  </li>
            <li>will say it smells nice</li>
            <li>but it did not cause any type of irritation or side effects of any kind.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell though your skin will feel gooey for about 30 minutes after application.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it is working well.  </li>

            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>However, all opinions are honest and my own and are not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>It kind of puts me in a nice space before I hit the pillow.</li>
            <li>A nice aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it, and will continue to buy...good luck...</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an effective Anti Cellulite cream for years, and this is absolutely the BEST product on the market.</li>
            <li>this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try since I saw many good reviews on Amazon... and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>The cream is organic, light and fast absorbing;it has great ingredients and a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The cocktail of 25 plant extracts is unique among cellulite treatments and provides great moisturizing effect in addition to cellulite blasting.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it in the mail!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it - very light and pleasant...</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the great thing about this product is that it does more than just reduce cellulite (which after continued use) will be visible to see.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells lovely, absolutely lovely, a wonderful sort of fresh citrusy smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and is also super conditioning</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t worked for me and has a very strong smell</li>
            <li>This cream has shown the best results by far!</li>
            <li>This item seems to contain the right ingredients to fight cellulite, but the best I can say for it is that it does make your skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream about 2 month ago, and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely so far the best product I&#x27;ve tried for the prevention of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I used to use another kind more but it takes forever to soak in.</li>
            <li>I thought because I paid more it would work faster and have amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product well over a year now and can honestly say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The best anti cellulite cream so far.</li>
            <li>As far this is one of the best anti cellulite products I have used.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far have gone through one bottle.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely erased&lt;br /&gt;my cellulite, but the appearance is greatly improved!</li>
            <li>This one by far, works the very best.  </li>
            <li>I remember when I was at school my aunt was in direct sales and was introducing women beauty items, and that time she told me that her anti-cellulite products were her best sellers.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective product to reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I liked and like the way she looks because I love her, and I don&#x27;t understand why all women are so preoccupied with cellulite.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I love this product along with the scrub.</li>
            <li>It smells good which is a plus, it feels light and all that deserves 4 stars for now.</li>
            <li>I am a competitive national bikini competitor, so I live a healthy lifestyle of exercise and perfect diets.</li>
            <li>It is super refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li>love the light pleasant scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, has many herbal ingredients, and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>but I was happy I am doing the right thing in my fight with cellulite.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent, REALLY work and work so quickly!</li>
            <li>for quite a while, and Nuelle by far is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>Of course, I believe you should also complement the cream with some exercise and/or a kind of healthy diet to help the product work better.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous, the consistency is perfect, andbest of all it really reduces cellulite.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product contains top 20+ well known botanical cellulite fighting ingredients, which is amazing in and of itself.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and it makes your skin even more soft and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy absorptive  and smell god ,and after using  him ,my  skin look  better.</li>
            <li>This product had a very rich consistency that made it very easy to massage into my skin..</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also very refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that the size is pretty generous for what you pay.</li>
            <li>I bought this item fair and square, full price plus shipping, no discount or incentive from this site.</li>
            <li>It is very important for me that products I use are organic and work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy but very light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, 120 lbs and very fit.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and rubs in easily</li>
            <li>This product is easy to rub in and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>BUT IT DID NOT ONE BIT OF GOOD FOR MY MILD CELLULITE.</li>
            <li>This cream absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice scent and seems to work nicely.</li>
            <li>but I do see a huge difference in my stomach!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have noticed firmer more toned skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>Before this one I was using Vichy&#x27;s products, and I think this is better.</li>
            <li>I also love all the healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Cellulite Looks about 50% better with using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it does look better.  </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing to your skin.</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;re all looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that makes us feel better about ourselves.  </li>
            <li>I am sure as I continue using Skin QR Organics –</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love the sample eye cream I receive with every purchase.</li>
            <li>This lotion contains a cocktail of 25 well known &amp;#34;flub Busters&amp;#34; that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction like caffeine, Butchers Broom, Bladderwrack, ivy and many others.</li>
            <li>ok, its supposed to feel that way.</li>
            <li>I also know, that I need to hydrate more than I do.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am gaining muscle where it was a lot of fat, but the jiggle tightened up and to me that is a magic.</li>
            <li>I would keep using until I attain the desired goal and recommend this to anyone dealing with jiggly areas :)</li>
            <li>so hopefully as I continue using it it&#x27;ll go away even more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I scrub the better outcome will be.</li>
            <li>and I want to see more results.  </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that after I put it on, it had an interesting heating effect.  </li>
            <li>but u also need to workout to see the better result.</li>
            <li>They state that you should eat healthy and exercise for this product to work.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found organic works better for my body.</li>
            <li>I was %100 satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with this cellulite treatment cream.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better</li>
            <li>I apply once a day after I shower and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>the cherry on top...</li>
            <li>Update after one month of use: While NuElle won&#x27;t make your cellulite magically disappear, it does have a noticeable effect after a month of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully satisfied of this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t  replace healthy  eating and exercise to lose weight.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>effect to make you sweat more in areas you apply it to burn fat.</li>
            <li>have been looking better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy and has a kind of shininess to it that almost looks like it</li>
            <li>did receive this product free from Tomoson but the experience and opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing</li>
            <li>But it has to be team work, eat healthy and exercise.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i recommend  it a 100%</li>
            <li>and I eat in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>However, all the ppl saying it smells refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even close to refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good natural alternative also, so you can feel good about that as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I did do what another person did and use it with the Avalon Organics CoQ 10 firming lotion and got lovely results.</li>
            <li>so I can stay on top of it and not run out.</li>
            <li>Smell is OK, but who cares, I like the results.</li>
            <li>My legs need a bit more work, but there has been improvement.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using with some sort of skin massager for faster and better results.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions though, for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li>and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This product contains over 20 botanical cellulite fighting agents to help give you the best looking skin possible for your body.</li>
            <li>I love having a product that is organic that I can use.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Will use it more to see how well it works on cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, and have ordered multiple bottles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that helps as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered more</li>
            <li>ok but didn&#x27;t do anything for the cellulite.</li>
            <li>I also love the seaweed scrub</li>
            <li>I love wearing shorts now.  </li>
            <li>Must try for banishing cellulite!! :)</li>
            <li>Had better luck with Nivea.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are not laden with chemicals, looking forward to trying more products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year now, and totally love it.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of NuElle&#x27;s cellulite tx, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>, seeing these results I have ordered more bottles today.</li>
            <li>With continued use 2x a day, skin tone gets better and better.  </li>

            <li>This is definitely the best cellulite lotion I have come across.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients</li>
            <li>, I also tried the body scrub and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I noticed this one works way better</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>and i see a difference in my thighs this product really works and it smells great.</li>
            <li>This one beats the others for sure.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the body blaster to my routine to see if the results are even greater.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that I will see even more results by the spring.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, even my husband noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It really works and feels great.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best cellulite product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This has helped her a lot reducing the cellulite, of course it isn&#x27;t magical.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
            <li>There was a product I tried before that worked much better.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>It gets better with time.</li>
            <li>It has many ingredients which are proven to help eliminate the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for a while</li>
            <li>Anti-Cellulite sounds like a magic to me.</li>
            <li>Even my jeans seem to be fitting better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to be more pro-active</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I use to work out a lot more</li>
            <li>so the more</li>
            <li>I guess it would be better</li>
            <li>, you must change your lifestyle as in eating healthy and working out...</li>
            <li>Although I am within a healthy weight I have had cellulite in my legs since age 12... and nothing has worked until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been more than 20 lbs over weight nor have I ever had a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have also applied around the eyes to some effect but a dedicated caffeine based eye-cream works much better.</li>
            <li>I have also applied around the eyes to some effect but a dedicated caffeine based eye-cream works much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used SO many products that claim to work, but I have never noticed results like this before.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I have had a better outcome with their seaweed scrub.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best cellulite products on the market, and for the price</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and smells great.</li>
            <li>But most of us deal with it, so what are we supposed to do about it?</li>
            <li>The company says the combination of these ingredients will reduce the appearance of cellulite within 2-3 weeks for most users.</li>
            <li>but then most experiments are a hit or a miss</li>
            <li>I will use this bottle twice a day, and I hope to receive even better results.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will continue delivering with continuous use.</li>
            <li>so I need lots more work with them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also make sure I exfoliate my skin in the shower because I feel that the cream absorbs better that way.  </li>
            <li>This product is my favorite from Amazon to date.  </li>
            <li>Sure there is some noticeable improvement but with the eating regimen(use  </li>
            <li>not buy again, will just exercise more, cut out a lot of carbs and massage tush/thigh area with a massage mitt.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product that I have come to really enjoy.</li>
            <li>If you are sitting on the fence, give this one a try because unlike many products, this one is a no brainer.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t ever stop making it please :)</li>
            <li>So, I feel like I am trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>I am sure that helped too.</li>
            <li>and I will surely pick up another bottle once this one runs out.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>My skin was so much more radiant and shiny, felt tighter and softer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products that promise results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to do more lunges and squats &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I think I sweat more this way</li>
            <li>so it probably works better.</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>By now I have tried many cellulite treatments under the sun and this one takes the cake, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Of course, I used it together with a workout routine (I jogged 3 miles 2 to 3 times a week) and was more mindful of my diet.</li>
            <li>Not only have I seen improvements in the 4 weeks I have been using it, but I love that it is made with all the very best ingredients!</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products and this one truly made a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this and will never switch to another product again.</li>
            <li>and after a week I was able to see my skin improving.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle</li>
            <li>My legs look more defined.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying the way my legs feel</li>
            <li>, they feel smooth and my skin texture is nice and supple.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using to take advantage of the improved circulation and more toned look</li>
            <li>The smell is ok with me, and I don&#x27;t notice a tingle.</li>
            <li>Much better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to try yet another creme.  </li>
            <li>I am a fitness bikini competitor and I have been looking for a product the reduce my cellulite or make it disappear (even better)</li>
            <li>I love the mint smell</li>
            <li>and I love this spa quality product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen many results.</li>
            <li>AND I TRULY TRUST AND LOVE</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I simply love it.  </li>
            <li>I received another order of this today and will continue to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>and I love its smell, too.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the products in market.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this cellulite, body cream.</li>
            <li>I have maintained a healthy weight, and try to stick to a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li>5 Stars, more like 100 Stars.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>As I have used more than one bottle, I see the results work every time I use it.</li>
            <li>When I returned the cellulite had returned to her buttocks/hip area, but the front of her thighs looked better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t factitiously claim that the fat will go away even if you stop working out or managing your healthy diet and that this product will miraculously burn away your fat forever.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having tried many products over many years, I had settled on St. Ives cellulite shield, which I did think helped somewhat, then they stopped making it</li>
            <li>They are smoother and firmer and look much better.</li>
            <li>ripples I had are not so visible any more.</li>
            <li>The lemon citrus scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance...absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li>...looks better...</li>
            <li>this makes you feel better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You have to use it continuously, but you should moisturize anyway, so you get an awesome double benefit!</li>
            <li>it has it in more things to fight the flab than any I have used yet .</li>
            <li>My mistake, my goofy self should of read more on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do try to eat healthy all the time, but have to admit those potato chips and soda</li>
            <li>It also gives your skin a fresh cooling feeling which I loved.</li>
            <li>My skin looks a lot more even and my skin looks firmer.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>After reading some more, it did say that it has a diuretic effect and it works both on the surface and in depth.</li>
            <li>I think with continuous use there may be even more improvement.</li>
            <li>Glad I chose this product</li>
            <li>This gives me approximately 2 more months.</li>
            <li>I used to just deal with it because I knew it was mostly genetic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the exercising has helped as well.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and more toned.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel nice and smooth with some of the best  quality products on the market definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li>AND I APPRECIATE THE INGREDIENTS ARE HEALTHY</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feel tighter for sure.</li>
            <li>so I know it will take a lot more than wearing this lotion to reduce them.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 6 different brands of cellulite creams and this one works the best!  </li>
            <li>It not only takes care of cellulite, but smells great and is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just love it and started to see results in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product when used and understood properly, and by that</li>
            <li>It does work, I have just ordered 3 more bottles, even though I have to pay delivery to Madrid</li>
            <li>My best friend later on bought me</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using it and buying another one just to be sure that improvement continues.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this lotion for about 6 months now and love it a lot.</li>
            <li>After a month, twice a day, I seen results, my skin looked better.  </li>
            <li>i like this lotion and probably will buy more when i finish my bottle.</li>
            <li>use it every day with a cellulite brush and along with an intense exercise routine, it has greatly helped me reduce my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have always eaten in moderation, maintained a healthy weight, and exercise 5-6 times per week; but that did not prevent me from inheriting my mom&#x27;s cottage cheese butt/thighs.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell (smells like a spa) and the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>Their concentrate boasts 25 of the best cellulite fighting ingredients such as: Caffeine, L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10,</li>
            <li>Then it magically felt better and healed faster.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>While the results aren&#x27;t drastic, I&#x27;m confident I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin look much better and healthier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>For the cost I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to work for me :)</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and pleasant and goes on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>But this product has definitely made an improvement, along with the massager which I love!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant to use--a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This kind absorbs much more quickly so I can put on pants instead of standing around forever or having my pants stuck to my legs when I stand up.</li>
            <li>This creme goes on very smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>Not too strongly fragranced, goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet smell also which I like.  </li>
            <li>and they both loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cellulite cream for over a month now and am so excited with the results!  </li>
            <li>and yet I would still see significant results!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>New great find for me.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is strong though.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean and refreshing and the texture fells smooth and warm.</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of a strong scent that may not be appealing to everyone</li>
            <li>well I should&#x27;ve known better when most reviewers were given free stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this product line is the best I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li>I only use once per day with very good results.</li>
            <li>Very very cool.  </li>
            <li>I love how light this cream is when applied.  </li>
            <li>I have also tries fat girl slim and cellulean and this is the best!</li>
            <li>but I am totally happy with the #NuElle Cream so far.</li>
            <li>my skin DID look and feel more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think what&#x27;s most important is that the product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy that I found NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate from Skin QR Organics.</li>
            <li>Not only it is made just with NATURAL ingredients but also has the perfect consistency to perform a good massage in my problem areas. ....</li>
            <li>I will update and happily change to 5 stars, if by chance; this product completely exonerates my \\&quot;problem.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream smells great and leaves skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to watch your fat and sodium intake, fighting cellulite takes more than slapping on a cream.</li>
            <li>and I am noticing my skin becoming firmer and the dimples disappearing</li>
            <li>It was great to see that the instructions were clear of when to apply lotion, so that you get the results.</li>
            <li>and I foresee this becoming a permanent part of my beauty routine akin to night cream and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I came across this NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it&#x27;s not sticky, and makes my skin feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>but after one week I noticed my skin becoming firmer from using this product.</li>
            <li>Loved the results and ran out and really saw the improvements that the product made since I ran out.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered another bottle to have when I finish this one.</li>
            <li>good and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It also has a nice fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are super clean , amazingly effective and I love how my skin drinks it in.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft and smooth plus it smells great.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome and my skin looks more tight.</li>
            <li>I also have purchased the seaweed scrub, which I use all over my body, and is great on my face since it&#x27;s a fine grain scrub and has natural oils that moisturize also.</li>
            <li>I had the best results with thing product comparing to other brands.</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to use more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of amazing how soft it made my skin feel,</li>
            <li>It’s easily lasts a month and twenty something dollar investment per month is nothing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the scrub mitten because I am an easy bruiser.</li>
            <li>Definitely got the results and more And a great deal too.</li>
            <li>I get up in the morning, take a shower, put the cream on, and wait one hour (which is easy because I&#x27;m fixing my hair, putting makeup on, getting dressed, etc.)</li>
            <li>2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal (easy for me because I eat 6 meals per day, every 3 hours).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordering was easy and I received the product promptly.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser made it easy to use and portable</li>
            <li>When I applied it, it smelled great, and I was able to feel it actually working!</li>
            <li>I think this works good as a skin tightening cream more than a cream that gets rid of cellulite completely...</li>
            <li>And they are VERY quick to deliver they&#x27;re products as well.</li>
            <li>and it has a strong odor</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s strong when you apply it but does stay in your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural which I love and it works which I love more!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, it smells good</li>
            <li>service is also great, i had an issue with one of the bottles i ordered and they replaced it right away, very friendly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the pump bottle is really nice and gives you a consistent amount each time.</li>
            <li>This organic cellulite firming lotion is the first I have tried in its kind.</li>
            <li>It is also very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>This treatment is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and looking forward to trying other products!</li>
            <li>While exercises can bring significant upgrades to cellulite areas, I know that I should consider the right and effective products for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you want a little help smoothing out your skin in problem areas (mine are thighs), this product does a great job in conjunction with healthy eating and focused workouts!</li>
            <li>it really helps you sweat more and shed the bloat!</li>
            <li>So much so that I started using it on my neck, I love that tightening feeling!</li>
            <li>I rated this cream a 3 because it does a great job of making your skin super soft</li>
            <li>I like the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate citrus smell, light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>and it dries super fast!!!!  </li>
            <li>The main indicator for me that something is happening is that when I stand in strong overhead light (sunlight, some dressing rooms--what are they thinking?!?!)</li>
            <li>I think it works best on people who needs to tone up their body a little.</li>
            <li>I ran out and ordered 3 more containers before the first one I ordered ran out!  </li>
            <li>How amazing to have a smooth, tight skin and proudly wear your swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a huge bottle at 5oz, 150 ml.</li>
            <li>Love it... feels nice on skin and not messy... tightens skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement with her cellulite.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed the huge difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my thighs by just looking</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t see a huge result yet, but</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a huge reduction in mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, twice a day every day as suggested on the label, and haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but there is a difference.</li>
            <li>Not only have a noticed a huge change in my cellulite, but this product smells great.</li>
            <li>The bottle you get is huge.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz twice already, and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The cream is light, smoothing and absorbent.  </li>
            <li>It is a smooth cream</li>
            <li>I used it at night before bed and used an electric light heated massage in a circular motion to hopefully increase the acceptance of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I got this product free for a review.</li>
            <li>and I have DEFINITELY seen great results.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love the outcome so far..</li>
            <li>Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiant Skin Gradual Tan Moisturizer all over just to make sure the product gets fully absorbed on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can proudly wear short shorts and a bikini without hesitation.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for this review.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>It spreads well and leave my skin feeling hydrated and look smooth.</li>
            <li>I was chosen to try a bottle of Skin QR Organics NuElle Anti-cellulite Firming Concentrate for free through a promotion.</li>
            <li>I have no problem with that, as it takes 10 seconds to rub it on both legs simultaneously, and actually smells great.  </li>
            <li>Still smells clean and not too strong after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The application is easy and clean.</li>
            <li>If you are are struggling with advanced cellulite, go ahead and use the cream it will still work to your advantage.</li>
            <li>And I feel you should do more research and take more action on top of it.</li>
            <li>, my thigh looks toned and the skin is smooth and taut.</li>
            <li>This fantastic product contains a working combination of 25 well known flub busters to help in weight loss and reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li>I even think it helped smooth out my stretch</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a cellulite cream that is gentle, no heat sensation and yet effective on my skin.</li>
            <li>: I also apply the lotions to my face and neck with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>: I also apply the lotions to my face and neck with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>All in all, celulite is not yet a primary nagging problem, but I like to be proactive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the last year or so, and it&#x27;s delivered some great results.</li>
            <li>I got this product free via tomoson.com, but I WILL NOT let that affect the integrity of this review.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product that actually performs as per the description.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month now and the bottle feels light already.</li>
            <li>That was great to hear from a critical bunch like them.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I actually re-ordered it.</li>
            <li>Makes your legs feel smooth and not oily</li>
            <li>I feel as though this product is helping smooth things out.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not have a scent.</li>
            <li>I give this a 4 because it does have a light fish odor combined with a ginger odor.  </li>
            <li>Product is packaged well ensuring it remains secure during the shipment.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience</li>
            <li>smell very nicely- smooth to apply .</li>
            <li>(I see it is now available again).</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li>My butt, thighs and stomach are cellulite free</li>
            <li>As soon I got my free bottle</li>
            <li>I am using this primarily on my thighs an gluts</li>
            <li>However, I like its scent and makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for second time ,and all i have to say is i&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I received the product free* to try and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*regardless of getting this product for free</li>
            <li>Pump dispenser is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got this free and it works.</li>
            <li>Only been using for about a wk now and have noticed firming a really great product</li>
            <li>It make my skin soft and elastic, smells good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I like that the product is natural, it smells and feels good.</li>
            <li>It has nice, soothing, soft sent that helps me relax even more.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 3-4 cellulite creams/lotions/gels over the years and this is by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Treating cellulite is an ongoing process, meaning I&#x27;ll have to continue using something to keep the monster at bay, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found two new products that work so well for me and at pretty reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I use this on an empty stomach right before I work out, for some reason I fell that does the best for me, since I am already burning fat while working out, why not have it consecrate on the areas the cream is.</li>
            <li>It delivers the right amount with no waste, and is great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Love the pump - and that it dispenses the right amount.</li>
            <li>After working out and eating right to lose more weight in hopes of getting rid of them when that didn&#x27;t work I almost gave in to getting another costly cosmetic procedure to repair the damage...</li>
            <li>and it definitely has been a huge improvement!!!</li>
            <li>this is the first review I have ever written...and I am writing about it because it works!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Very intriguing.</li>
            <li>Pleasant forest-like fragrance, easy absorption and along with exercise, proper diet and water intake</li>
            <li>believe getting up and rubbing my torso vigorously as I apply the lotion would have its own steady effect; that light exercise raises the body temperature,</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try it out since I am a huge skeptic</li>
            <li>I did not do any special exercise or diet, I actually stopped going to the gym for some time and still saw great results.</li>
            <li>I have never felt more confident in a bikini and this will be my new necessity every summer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for awhile and have noticed a significant difference</li>
            <li>I do see some improvement though and feel like I&#x27;d get additional results if I was more consistent.</li>
            <li>my results will only get better and better!</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working or not.</li>
            <li>received free full size product in order to review.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>had a bit of saggy skin on my arms which has tightened up significantly.</li>
            <li>I have, though, significantly upped my workouts</li>
            <li>Out of all the lotions I have used this one seems to work the best without spending a small fortune on lotions</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>As before, I continue to go to the gym, drink tons of water and eat healthy so everything has been consistent except the product used.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered the set with the scrub and massager.</li>
            <li>I was sooooo excited when I read all the reviews about how this worked for people who were athletic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I wasn&#x27;t sure it  that this would work as I have never tried this type of product before  </li>
            <li>Even my sister made a comment that my legs looks significantly smoother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I do work out 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy, so</li>
            <li>I am the first time buyer, will need more time to evaluate it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for 3 months while continuing my exercise and healthy diet</li>
            <li>Update: in my original review, I wrote: ...</li>
            <li>On thing to note: I packed my first bottle in a checked bag, and when I got it out after the flight, the top had popped off the container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with cellulite and this product is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I would have success with it!</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this with the sewed scrub and massager balls.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is light and absorbs fairly quickly, the smell is a bit swampy but not the deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It has a light lemon fragrance that quickly faded away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable, clean, and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best anti-cellulite creams I&#x27;ve used - at a far lower price than the ones from the \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; counters at the big name stores.  </li>
            <li>lets keep it clean.</li>
            <li>love that this is a light cream, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li>plus the smell &amp; texture are far better than many competitors.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply just like lotion and its worth the buy</li>
            <li>I am working out and eating a fairly clean diet as well.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have had to purchase a lot of this kind of product &amp; this one is the best .</li>
            <li>was given the opportunity to try Skin QR Organics, NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite for free in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li>I would love to put a positive review but ....</li>
            <li>So far love this product!</li>
            <li>The Nuelle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite treatment is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>In fact, I actually kind of liked the light and natural scent of this concentrate and it made my skin feel really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and leaves my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to use and provides the right amount of product for me.</li>
            <li>what i really love though is that the product is very clean and all natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most consistent user and I should be because I love it so much, but I use it as often as I use any of my beloved &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products and this has definitely become one of them.  </li>
            <li>Though not 100 percent gone (and I don&#x27;t expect it to be right away), I do have to admit WHAT A DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>I have to start right off with it WORKS!</li>
            <li>buying right now - AGAIN!</li>
            <li>The first week I didn&#x27;t see any significant change but by the second week it was AMAIZING love love this product, it works wonders, my skin looks better and feels tighter as well.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the fact that it&#x27;s full of high quality organic ingredients as well!</li>
            <li>The NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It has a really refreshing smell that&#x27;s very spa-like</li>
            <li>Well, they&#x27;re full of you know what.  </li>
            <li>i noticed it does make me sweat more during intense activity.</li>
            <li>It really tightens up your skin and the smell is almost intoxicating - love it.  </li>
            <li>Good product and bought my second bottle so that I don&#x27;t run out before I get my replacement.</li>
            <li>I LOVED it and bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li>to sure how much it helped with my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, but it is sooo nice, and I know it is natural because of the brand.</li>
            <li>Now I am a true believer of Nuelle.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but none has given me the results as fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having never \\&quot;treated\\&quot; the area before, the results really popped at first, with me seeing a good deal of tightening within the first three months; the rest of my results happened gradually, sometimes in bursts</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about literally every product Ive used from these folks.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Currently, we’re testing the NuElle Anti Cellulite Concentrate to see how good of a job it does on the “flub”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different creams and really loved this one.</li>
            <li>and that is so true,</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will wait to see if good on cellulite, it has only been a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves your legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I would honestly recommend this product to anyone who is self conscious about their cellulite without any hesitation.</li>
            <li>So, my thought is that it has to be used on a regular basis to maintain good results.  </li>
            <li>It kept my skin soft and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>I started to use it 2-3 times a day making sure to run it in really well.</li>
            <li>Good quality, last a while</li>
            <li>Feels good actually using something with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>With so many on the market I really did my research</li>
            <li>I must say that I am a big skeptic when it comes to cellulite creams or any creams that promise results that are too good to be true.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it absorbs nicely and is not sticky like some other products.</li>
            <li>Loving this actually needing to buy some more because I&#x27;m running out of first</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and with all the good reviews I decided to go for it - WELL, it did absolutely NOTHING!!  </li>
            <li>At first the smell bothered me and now its fine and doesn&#x27;t even phase me.</li>
            <li>Does work better than anything else I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different creams, workouts</li>
            <li>I noticed results fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Both products went quickly though.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived quite quickly, and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>The deal breaker is that it didn&#x27;t do much for my actual cellulite, its a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>Now I am on my second and love it even more.</li>
            <li>Mild smell, not offensive.</li>
            <li>This is more noticeable on my upper arms, but it gets a lot better on the thighs too.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more :)</li>
            <li>but that might be just because it doesn&#x27;t absorb quick at all.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome is the second bottle I ordered and for sure is working I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has been a blessing in disguise where my cellulite is concerned.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the benefits of this product and look forward to even greater results with it in the future.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how quick this works.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how quickly I started to see an improvement.</li>
            <li>Skin QR Organics Anti Cellulite cream has a mild scent, but it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks the cream rather quickly</li>
            <li>I have a mild amount of cellulite/dimply skin around my thighs but work out 5-6 times a week.</li>
            <li>(it is not available in Europe, you guys have it good:) ).</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.  </li>
            <li>It does suggest not using it while pregnant I would suggest this for men who just like to reduce their cellulite.</li>
            <li>You can tell all the ingredients are high quality and I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>I just resisted the temptation to write a review right away as I wanted to see if the magic continues, thanks to my skepticism.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how many fabulous ingredients and how it worked, You don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural and made with organic ingredients!!</li>
            <li>I started using it, I first noticed the scent which was pleasant and reminded me of wintergreen mixed with lemon grass.</li>
            <li>but in the first week I could see a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Triple Action - Does an excellent job compared to the product that is twice as much with same results.  </li>
            <li>Upon the first application I noticed how light the cream is.</li>
            <li>I found that the best way to use this, it was to apply every other day using the massager and wrapping my  legs and butt with the Clear Plastic wrap ( Yes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wasn&#x27;t very consistent with the use</li>
            <li>I saw some very interesting before and after of women who totally transformed their bodies.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and have placed a second order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went with another product not to long ago because of the reviews and though a boost would be good</li>
            <li>Tried several lotions, gels and creams without any results but can honestly say that NuElle Triple Action is effective in treating Cellulite.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a great product to help you break down some unwanted cellulite or help you aide in your weight</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:After contacting the suppliers concerning the cap problem, I received top service and a new product was sent to me asap.</li>
            <li>This product is better than a majority of the products I have tried, and I, like you, read the reviews before trying new products.  </li>
            <li>It is great that I have also noticed that previously I retained water and this has helped with water retention as well.</li>
            <li>it smelled great and had a light texture to it when I released a small amount to try.</li>
            <li>I has quite a strong smell, and I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>I also been taking pole-dancing fitness classes 3-4x/week (super fun BTW)</li>
            <li>I really like this product, not greasy, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very moisturized (like all day!!).</li>
            <li>amazing lotion is only the &amp;#34;icing&amp;#34; on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic too.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and I intend to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Triple Actions Anti Cellulite is the ONLY reason I am able to wear shorts this summer!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>And it really works!!</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;Phat QR Body and Cellulite Massager Waterproof&amp;#34; and the combination of all three has really improved the appearance of cellulite on my legs!!</li>
            <li>I have just purchased my second bottle and look forward to seeing even more results!</li>
            <li>Pleased so far!</li>
            <li>On top of that, right after the first bottle have finished, I already saw a large difference.</li>
            <li>This is a light cream texture, easy to apply, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I do however, recommend that when you rub this in, be prepared to wait a good 5-10 minutes if your schedule allows for your skin to air dry to help the &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation to go a way quicker, than if you were to trap it in your clothing right after rubbing this product into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is amazing, this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle because I&#x27;ve witnessed amazing results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have been using if for a few weeks now</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about this product is that when i put it on it makes my skin really smooth, theres no reason to dislike this it.</li>
            <li>gives amazing soft skin, i really enjoy!not</li>
            <li>I have tried many things, but recently I found this product and liked the organic and natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Amazing results within a short time period.</li>
            <li>The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s really helped smooth out my thighs and bum.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to change their skin into silk and have it be smooth.</li>
            <li>like the way it feels and the fast absorption into the skin, and it also has a light fragrance too.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh</li>
            <li>I receive products complimentary to review, all opinions are 100% mine and after use of product</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and almost cellulite free.  </li>
            <li>and it’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and i am rubbing it in morning before my waist trainer and evening after i take my waist trainer off, no crazy results yet</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>It does create a warming sensation, which lets you know the product is indeed working, but I feel I need to use it more frequently, before I notice the results I am hoping for.</li>
            <li>you but fewer lumps and bumps which alone was worth it there.</li>
            <li>Smells great  and left skin soft but didn&#x27;t notice any change in appearance</li>
            <li>The cost is WELL worth the response you will get</li>
            <li>I prefer more of an open top so that you can scrape the insides of the bottle to get every last bit of product vs. a pump design with a top that can&#x27;t easity be removed.</li>
            <li>(I am not just writing a favorable review for the chance of free product), and will order more in the future.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product not knowing of what kind of results to expect.</li>
            <li>The product itself just seems so healthy, organic and natural.</li>
            <li>As is a problem for many fit males, I had deep smile parentheses that have all but vanished by now, leaving a far more rested and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>As is a problem for many fit males, I had deep smile parentheses that have all but vanished by now, leaving a far more rested and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>So, absolutely worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>So, again, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say and agree that this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I love that its natural</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>This one is so different and effective</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell.</li>
            <li>This 5oz bottle of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate was used as my lotion day and night to make sure I can receive maximum results.</li>
            <li>so I would say it is safe for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the product&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I liked it, and already ordered my second one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in firmness and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I continued to use the product and now that I have been using it for a good amount of time I have definitely been able to see and feel the changes, and I can definitely vouch for this miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any woman who is looking after her figure in a more natural way.</li>
            <li>The seller is awesome, I&#x27;ve received all my orders on time or earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I am not big fan of the smell but for smooth skin I will do anything:)</li>
            <li>Just by looking at the ingredients, there are so many great oils that are ofcourse amazing for your skin, such as: Aloe, Sunflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Geranium essential Oil, Rosehip Oil, Evening Primrose Oil.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other oils and ingredients that were interesting because I have never really noticed them in lotions.</li>
            <li>Pump bottle is high quality, easy to disoense.&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li>After having tried many other anti-cellulite lotions on the market, I can say  unequivocally that this anti-cellulite concentrate has the most popular anti-cellulite ingredients in a natural formulation that works very well at reducing the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Works far better than anything else I have tried and at a good price compared to the other products out there.</li>
            <li>I began using this product about 3 months ago and unlike all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this definitely reduced the appearance of my cellulite (plus it&#x27;s organic and smells awesome too!).  </li>
            <li>i go through them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product, but it is natural without perfume, which is more important to me.</li>
            <li>even completely finishing the first bottle I ordered a second one and I will continue using this product since I am absolutely happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I do think it will take more than a few weeks for the Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to be able to take full effect.  </li>
            <li>The smell is surprisingly pleasant and the lotion feels like any other lotion (no weird tingling).</li>
            <li>use it right after we get out of the shower and rub it in.</li>
            <li>If it is burning in any way wash right off.</li>
            <li>My loyalty stays right here.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT look at my right side</li>
            <li>I also work out about five times a week, and I like to put this cream on right before I work out.</li>
            <li>and you get the right amount every time.  </li>
            <li>The product also is greasy, so if you are going to put on some clothes right away</li>
            <li>Info work out and eat right</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, as cellulite can be very stubborn, and I will likely recommend this product to any woman with cellulite.</li>
            <li>The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother just in time for my first cruise to the Bahamas.  </li>
            <li>Out of all others I tried in the past year, this one so far is the best.</li>
            <li>After all I am aware that it will take more than a month or two to see any considerable change.</li>
            <li>I TRIED MANY MANY MANY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, BEING NAME BRAND HIGH END PRODUCTS (CLARINS), AND</li>
            <li>&#x27;s, first start out by a funny story though about me testing this out!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and would highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with cellulite.  </li>
            <li>Remember that cellulite is a strong enemy and usually no one thing can beat it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did, as the new choices work much</li>
            <li>I have previously used Cellutherm (8oz) which worked well, but last time I tried to order, my security system said &amp;#34; dodgy website.&amp;#34;  This is an excellent alternative &amp; I trust Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was not looking for miracle, a small difference would of been great, but I got no change at all.</li>
            <li>Great size bottle and just a small quarter size amount does the trick.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I recommend you pay a higher price for this product because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The smell is not so good but seems to die down after it dries up.</li>
            <li>I was delighted when I opened my package to see that they had sent me some samples of their other products!</li>
            <li>I will not say that your cellulite will disappear overnight, but with consistent use and a little time, the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>I still want to see more improvement but husband saw a notable difference in as little as 3 wks time, using once a day (with a massager).</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product after trying other products in the past and not having any visible help with reducing cellulite, I am happy to say that this product does work.</li>
            <li>The best part is that this product is very competitively priced compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li>I am certainly going to continue and find out!</li>
            <li>The product appeared to tighten skin and was easy to dispense with the pump action dispenser bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more soft and much smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite for my entire life, even when I am in great shape, and this is the only product that has worked.</li>
            <li>Yes, I claim 100% responsibility for my lack of self-control, but I am oh-so happy to find a product that actually gives my skin back some of its lost youthfulness.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>a slight tingle--which is good....</li>
            <li>The texture is great, smell is minimal, and leaves your skin feeling so soft that you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The smell is surprising but quite fresh and green.</li>
            <li>This is the best firming lotion I have ever used, and I have used numerous others, including Clarins and Heavy Duty (by Jocott) brands.  </li>
            <li>the company is easy to deal with, communicates well and offers very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Other than that I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>the formula is non-greasy and soaks into the skin really well with no unpleasant scent or stickiness.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is organic and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>I like this one very much</li>
            <li>I think the price value of this product is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been using this in 2 different spots and I am Loving the results, that I may try a few more spots!</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong for me personally, but once applied the cream absorbs quickly, and the scent disappears.</li>
            <li>use consistently enough to determine results but high quality ingredients packaged nicely that will keep ingredients stable</li>
            <li>I even think I was only applying it once a day on week one, which might be why it took a while to work but do it twice a day and stick to it even if it looks like it&#x27;s not working because my cellulite is hereditary and I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it since puberty hit more years ago than I care to say</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>can/bottle, I&#x27;m breastfeeding, eating healthy,  waisting training and exercising and with this as extra help</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update i purchased more since last year</li>
            <li>This is just my second time using it, but I am 100% sure that I will continue using it over and over again.</li>
            <li>and I have seen results the first week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much it costs - I will pay for it because it WORKS!</li>
            <li>and I would only buy again if I for sure followed the recommended use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since April &amp; will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Works great, not too thick.  </li>
            <li>I did within the FIRST night.</li>
            <li>Thank you I for one will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>First off – I’m not a blogger</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Also the fact that it has all natural products is important to me too.</li>
            <li>I just finished using  my first bottle</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper to do it at home!</li>
            <li>So this is a real gem!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase, I researched a lot before I bought it, the ingredient list was exactly what I was looking for and being mostly organic  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>product when I first opened</li>
            <li>The key is also to continue a healthy fitness routine as well as staying hydrated to receive a maximum benefit.</li>
            <li>I have used many different creams over the years to help with my cellulite.</li>
            <li>In the two weeks, I saw more cellulite come back.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, products as described, hope this works!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I never go to the beach without first putting this product on.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first bottle of this</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered, and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever review.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
            <li>This product in my eyes is well worth the money and the time to really try this out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t totally remove it, but for me I think my stomach looks 50% better in the sun.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this and totally love it.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li>I work out avidly and just wanted something to help with the dimples in some problem areas.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>but you need to do a lot of squats, butt exercises, exercise overall and eat healthy.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much silkier and smoother as well!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to try longer.</li>
            <li>, I had already noticed the skin on my stomach looking so much smoother!</li>
            <li>Okay so I just started my second bottle of the Nuelle cellulite cream and on my 4th week of using it</li>
            <li>so much I am going to try another item from Skin QR Organics!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and soft without leaving it sticky.</li>
            <li>I literally cannot believe how much this reduces the appearance of cellulite!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m officially ready for vacation!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results, it not only helped but my legs look better than before I had my injury.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it daily over a month</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion in combination with the scrub and massager of the same brand and was able to see results within a week of using them (applying every night after a shower).</li>
            <li>cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out.</li>
            <li>cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out.</li>
            <li>Much Peace!</li>
            <li>When I first saw this NuElle</li>
            <li>I tried this cream for the first time</li>
            <li>I am almost at the end of my first bottle and repurchasing another now.</li>
            <li>This cream delivers exactly what it promises, it firms your skin and reduces the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft, supple, and smooth.</li>
            <li>to prevent it from plaguing me too much!</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li>Cellulite isn’t a pretty thing, my friends.</li>
            <li>I changed this from a 3 star to a one star because the company contacted me, trying to bully me into giving them a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I am seeing my middle, love handles and stomach a bit</li>
            <li>is my first bottle</li>
            <li>so I will give myself more time after the second bottle where the thighs are concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am also seeing more results on my middle and thighs</li>
            <li>I am now on my 2nd bottle, and hope to see more improvement as I go.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>My girlfriends who haven&#x27;t seen me for a while noticed it first.</li>
            <li>Love the scrub, body creme, and facial foaming</li>
            <li>overall look is better.</li>
            <li>I like this product and most likely reorder again.</li>
            <li>and if you use it without overdoing it, this product will last you a while. :)</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients reads like a who&#x27;s who of the top essential oils and herbs used to combat cellulite.</li>
            <li>This lotion made me ready for vacation in Miami Beach!</li>
            <li>I recommend when you first use this products,put it on 2 x times a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking with continued use things can only get better.  </li>
            <li>After using the first order I switched to another brand</li>
            <li>I do also exercise daily, drink lots of water, and eat healthy about 50% of the time.</li>
            <li>and it does moisturize pretty well.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING NUELLE TRIPLE ANTI CELLULITE LOTION FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH NUELLE!</li>
            <li>I really feel that when I rub it into my in a circular motion....that it is really absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li>But this product starts to show results within a couple of weeks, You have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day.</li>
            <li>But with this cream I started to see results in the first week.</li>
            <li>The product lasted exactly three weeks using it twice a day as directed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To rid of cellulite you must eat healthy, add some cardio daily and do lots and lots of squats!!</li>
            <li>and I work out consistently.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it has done for my thighs.</li>
            <li>I bought first one and saw effect in couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>However, fairly consistent use of this anti cellulite cream has truly and noticeably tightened and smoothed the skin in these areas to where I would even consider wearing a bathing suit this summer,</li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles, and I&#x27;m just starting the first of those.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>or so I saw real smoothing results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s second purpose, is the scent, I love it.</li>
            <li>packaging is great with the negative air pump.</li>
            <li>I normally use 1 full pump for each of my thighs, which is where i needed to focus on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no miracle where cellulite is concerned, it takes regular massaging and the appropriate product for one&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that I will see more results on my upper thighs before summer.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I am ordering my second bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seemed as if I could see a difference within the first week ( the Finulite could have contributed to that).</li>
            <li>I bought an entire set a couple of months ago and replenishing for sure now.</li>
            <li>higher end $60</li>
            <li>saw many complaints about the pump of the bottle, but I personally had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>You must be consistent though to see results.</li>
            <li>This was the first anti-cellulite cream that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I had an issue with the product when i first got it</li>
            <li>The first smell I smelled when I put it on was aloe.</li>
            <li>One of the first ingredients is water and then aloe juices.</li>
            <li>After the first week, you start noticing the difference.</li>
            <li>I see results for sure, and the product arrived 8 days prior to estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>lotion twice a day everyday plus exercise and good eating habits, has been a miracle to me.</li>
            <li>Worth it by far!!!</li>
            <li>NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate really works!!!</li>
            <li>So far this product has worked better that any other cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried, an I&#x27;ve tried many others.</li>
            <li>The amount of the cream should be more due to multiple times use to be effective.</li>
            <li>First of all, as other reviewers have mentioned, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>This cream has a very faint fragrance, it&#x27;s a very light beautiful smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells like old limes but is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Within first week it makes your skin super soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and happy so far.</li>
            <li>its easy to use and goes far beyond what others do to not only fight flab but make the skin you apply it to look smooth and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have re-ordered numerous times from this same company (quick shipping and nicely packaged).</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product, I would say give it some time with daily use and you&#x27;ll definitely see some good results.  </li>
            <li>Nice tightening action after only 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>…I&#x27;m a real brat about them because I just simply don&#x27;t like most--I love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought that because of the price it was going to be much stronger than the Nivea Cellulite serum (which actually works better)</li>
            <li>A good choice compared to so many products that say they do the trick although fail at it every time.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty decent and it does tighten the skin well!</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a positive difference in terms of water retention and circulation.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I chose to try this one based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Best on the market, like the other reviewer wrote - hands down!</li>
            <li>soooo pretty much</li>
            <li>The cellulite is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that minor issue, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing the lotion for the summer :)</li>
            <li>So, I guess I was too eager to get started, and didn&#x27;t read the directions very well at first.</li>
            <li>Give it time, patience and perseverance, I have noticed the first real results after around 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s all natural and is chalked full of ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I lost my muscle and developed what looked like a bag full of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I feel that I can see improvement on the cellulite on my legs and it is thick and creamy with a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of this products as other body lotions to cover an entire area, making it a really great value.</li>
            <li>I do some dry brushing before hand to make sure it penetrates well.</li>
            <li>I like to put a thicker layer, let it dry and then put on cotton leggings for better results.</li>
            <li>To get rid of cellulite is not that easy as it seems, it needs discipline, regular exercises and a quality skincare.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and is not artificially scented but smells so pretty.</li>
            <li>Usually they would SPREAD ALL OVER  the place, but now they look more fit and trim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have been using this product over 10 months and only after three months of use I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my upper arms, which now seems more tone and less crinkly.</li>
            <li>I have used NuElle products for the last six months, and I have already recommended this product to my family and friends and would strongly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>After being using this product for over a month I can certainly say I&#x27;ve seen the results.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly large amt.</li>
            <li>I did not have much hope to start with but after reading all these positive reviews I decided to try the product.</li>
            <li>Not usually writing reviews, but this product is worth all the bragging and effort to write it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to tell a huge difference after using this product, feels nice on my skin but has a very weird smell.</li>
            <li>you can pretty much FEEL the cream for at least a good couple hours after...</li>
            <li>The only problem is that you really need to put a lot on because it soaks in so easily.  </li>
            <li>Me and my husband were so delightful to notice a little result already the next day after only one time of using .</li>
            <li>It has a dual feature, for 1 it really works; keeps the skin tight and really does play a preventive role on top of eating right and exercise when it comes to fighting cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference on the back of my thighs after just a couple weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>it really works as I just bought this.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works, in fast period of time.</li>
            <li>My cellulite has definitely diminished and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>But cellulite is something that always wants to be at the party.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I have used up the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I continue to use this post shower, and really like the moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>Firms up the skin and works very well.</li>
            <li>My cellulite on my thighs has improved better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference; however it does state</li>
            <li>I had to pinch myself to see if really worked.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast as well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much difference.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very grateful.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everybody!</li>

            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I was very surprise with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent of this cream is very soothing, almost like a lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li>I think I really like it.</li>
            <li>this product along with sensible nutrition and exercising REALLY helps to detox  and diminish cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get rid of cellulite since I was a teenager without much luck.  </li>
            <li>It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I used it as directed until the whole bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>but cellulite is still very visible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>you have to be diligent and really massage it in.  </li>
            <li>i think that really helps too.  </li>
            <li>and I am really seeing a difference.</li>
            <li>I do not exercise much</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>I saw noticeable results after a few weeks and when I run out I&#x27;ll most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have cellulite</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I have read so much on these creams</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of any difference.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>But you have to put time into doing the whole process.</li>
            <li>My belly also seems much firmer.</li>
            <li>And I have seen that his really does work, we have since always been going to the gym but the cellulite was still there on her hamstrings.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I use it on my upper legs to tighten and smooth them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Product came fast even though is not prime.</li>
            <li>Really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>but after a month, I absolutely did see a difference there, too.</li>
            <li>but this product really helps.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>over whelming at times.. really don&#x27;t see an improvement at all</li>
            <li>It really does diminish the appearance of cellulite, results can be seen after about 3 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off and on for a couple years and can really tell a difference when I am using it.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to get rid of it and try to find the ways to do so.</li>
            <li>I really want that all beauty products were the quality of Skin QR Organics.</li>
            <li>This came so fast</li>
            <li>and I really want to get the body wash</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks with a combination of light cardio</li>
            <li>Much Peace!hin</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING for cellulite - this stuff works - and very well.</li>
            <li>ABOUT 30%.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING, BUT</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite to begin with, but I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my stretch marks have started fading.</li>
            <li>I think the combination of the 2 are what has really started making the difference.  </li>
            <li>That’s the whole process!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>You sweat a bit with it on at night but that tells you it is really working.</li>
            <li>This product feels very greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can put up with it....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a loss of about 1/4 inch on each arm and about that much on the thighs and butt.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use, but like any product that gives you visual results whether instant, or progressive results consistency is the key.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot)</li>
            <li>Looks promising to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do much exercises</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting help with this thanks to this NuElle Cellulite product.  </li>
            <li>I prefer pump dispenser and the NuElle is very sleek</li>
            <li>I will need to check into those to enhance my already promising results.</li>
            <li>Really like this product for temporary tightening of my thighs after a shower.</li>
            <li>it blends really well.</li>
            <li>what really sets this product apart.</li>
            <li>Really hoped for some visible change ...</li>
            <li>this really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also find the scent very spa-like</li>
            <li>and I really look forward to applying after my bath.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I can use some help, to be ready for the beach.</li>
            <li>It really tightens the areas where you apply it</li>
            <li>Nothing I have done has ever helped and I really didn&#x27;t believe in products claiming to do what this product claims it does.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much of a difference with this</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much cellulite.</li>
            <li>I had always used Clarins,but since using Nuelle I am much happier with the results.</li>
            <li>that’s how much of a difference I have experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does look better but not really the desire effects for the cost.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li>Really you can see results.</li>
            <li>but one must remember you really cannot get rid of Cellulite with a cream  </li>
            <li>and I was really</li>
            <li>, I got up in the morning and decided to look at the ingredients more carefully</li>
            <li>I am not seeing drastic difference, but don&#x27;t have much of a problem, but I am continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference with the appearance of my cellulite on butt and thighs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  really  care for the scrub?</li>
            <li>Results might vary based on size and skin type, so if you really want to know how it works you really need to try it for yourself to find</li>
            <li>works really well on the skin of my arms.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite</li>
            <li>this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, the product feels light yet firming up my skin.</li>
            <li>I really didnt think I had a chance.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much expectations after trying others, but there is hope in cellulite department when it comes to this one.</li>
            <li>It ships really fast and well</li>
            <li>and I am like really for that price and that much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend! &#x27;</li>
            <li>I tried this product and so far I liked the results, is not a miracle but slowly is helping a lot to smooth my skin and to minimize my cellulite.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly bad, but it is noticeable in the sun light and whenever I bend down.</li>
            <li>I have clearly seen a difference in my skin!!!  </li>
            <li>I didn’t have cellulite on my stomach, but I can tell my stomach and love handles are less bloated – this lotion really draws out water from your body because of the caffeine in it!</li>
            <li>My order came quickly the first time, a bit longer the second time</li>
            <li>I run out of my first bottle and ordered a new one that was delivered on Friday.</li>
            <li>Also a little bit goes a long way because it goes on so smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>not sure how much of it is the lotion, but definitely  want to try it some more to see more results</li>
            <li>I got the first bottle as a trial from a friend, loved it so much that I bought a second; saw a smoother appearance in just a few days.</li>
            <li>This has a light cream texture, it is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, it is also fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I think it takes a strict daily regimen to see a significant result.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love that sometimes they send samples of their other products that I now buy and love!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream based on other reviews andimI&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product several times and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>However, there is not enough significant difference for me to reorder this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my next step:) don&#x27;t be lazy, join me:)</li>
            <li>It works way better than other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it can feel tacky against form fitting clothes, like boxer-briefs, or the underarms until it absorbs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a tall bottle that blends in well on my bathroom counter top with my other products</li>
            <li>Love this, other than the scent 4 stars because of the scent.</li>
            <li>Skin QR Organics recommends using 2 of their other products with this Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate, after reading how the products work together it makes sense that the results will be even greater using the scrub and massager.  </li>
            <li>Everyone has a unique chemical make up and there may be some people who respond differently</li>
            <li>I am pleased with that, since I have not seen any results at all with other cheaper products.</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds but this one works!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is reasonable and I was surprised at how long the bottle lasted.</li>
            <li>I exercise every day and I am sure that helps too, but I have always been active and no other product left me as satisfied as this one.</li>
            <li>I have seen very minimal changes along my thigh area and these changes are for the better.</li>
            <li>one drawback i have to mention is that you do have to use it everyday for best results, and the bottles are rather small for the price.</li>
            <li>When used in combination with an active lifestyle and healthy eating choices, I SEE a visible difference.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I always want to put in my body, face and hair natural staff, so why not Natural and Helping to Reduce Cellulite? :)))</li>
            <li>I think the skin is more responsive after a bath or shower to the active ingredients.</li>
            <li>After my first bottle of this cream, I felt it was actually working and decided it was worth trying another bottle.  </li>
            <li>Finally something that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave any type of rash or dryness, it&#x27;s all natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Argania sent me a 5oz complimentary NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate product to test out and review, and I have been pleasantly surprised at my results!</li>
            <li>im pretty excited about that, especially since im a lot smaller than what i was before when first buying this product.</li>
            <li>Then I take 3 full pumps of this NuElle cream and 2 pumps of Nivea Gel and mix it in my hands and apply it all over my thighs, buttocks and any left over</li>
            <li>The skin definitely looks more smooth, firm and elastic.</li>
            <li>It is pretty natural for women to have cellulite</li>
            <li>It should be used twice a day what was the most was challenging, apply on thighs, buttocks and stomach every day, no matter if you are tired or busy.</li>
            <li>It may take a while longer to see its full potential but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;willing to stick it out for a while.</li>
            <li>it leaves a tiny bit of a residue but not bad.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering this product, I consider myself very fit, but I still have some cellulite on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>Thighs are slimming down a lil more and the cellulite appearance are reduced some and skin does feel firmer.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjuction with the New!</li>
            <li>Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  </li>
            <li>Regrettably, this is not a MIRACLE product and so far, after my first bottle, has not completely rid me of my unsightly cellulite (hence, the 4 stars), however; it does significantly improve the appearance, and for this I will re-purchase.  </li>
            <li>It appears to me the less fat and cellulite for the area being treated the faster this product works and the greater the cellulite is minimized.  </li>
            <li>My legs have less dimples and appear more toned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The areas we use it are: upper legs, upper arms, glute area, love handle, and stomach.</li>
            <li>This stuff not only works, it works quickly.</li>
            <li>Use only as directed and it is not recommended if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would say, is I would love it if the company offered a larger size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review early so I can get a free bottle, will update once I&#x27;m done with 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li>I see the most difference in the back of my thighs, under upper arms and neck and chin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and this is the only one that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>No results after few good everything is the same</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products, all with the same results --- nothing!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend NuElle to anyone looking for a cellulite reducing cream that works quickly.</li>
            <li>Most products haven&#x27;t worked in the past but this one does REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried NUMEROUS similar products over the years and have never been satisfied until NuElle.</li>
            <li>It helps if used daily after skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is quick and the product comes wrapped well in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>As i get older and my body isnt how it use to  be , i started looking for a product to help tighten up my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smell and hasn&#x27;t left a sticky residue after application.</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that I am buying twice, and I am definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>being organic is a plus, I am not much on chemicals, It is a pleasure knowing what I am putting on my skin is natural ingrediants made by God, and put into a lotion :)</li>
            <li>Nuelle provides lots of moisturizing, instantly makes my skin look more plump while ongoing use has definitely reduced my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I recently became proactive because I wanted to start focusing on being and looking healthy ( not getting any younger).</li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing, makes my skin soft and firm</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again; I love this stuff, it actually works.</li>
            <li>a final piece of advice, don&#x27;t place all your eggs in the same basket :).</li>
            <li>must say, I was very surprised by my results!</li>
            <li>I have been trying out several cellulite creams, being very aware that NO cellulite cream can cure this unsightly condition.</li>
            <li>Highly</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream given the reviews I read on here</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the vendor too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>However, I am used to high tingle tanning products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying NuElle.</li>
            <li>I am very toned and healthy &amp; the back of my thighs are the only area I have been self conscious about.</li>
            <li>This is really amazing, especially because I&#x27;ve tried a number of other creams with no noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine what will happen after a couple of other bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>&quot; Answer: worse than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li>Right away I could notice how smooth and firm my skin was getting, and after a month of use I can definitely say that this product is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one with really noticeable results; however, I have also been training for my first half marathon, so that may be having an effect as well.  </li>
            <li>Works a little better than working out without it.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m thinking that for someone like me I might need a little more time or work to get the results that I would like to get from this cream.</li>
            <li>While I did see some minor improvement with other products, this one is superior by far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I was getting a huge result from this product because I wasn&#x27;t serving dramatic results and was eexercising more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on her very liberally, twice a day, but since other reviewers are using it 1x daily and getting good results, I will cut back.  </li>
            <li>It does help firm up the skin which in turn helps with a more active lifestyle and being more conscious of what I eat.  </li>
            <li>It does smooth and firm up the skin nicely and gives a little confidence boost when headed out in bathing suite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other anti cellulite creams that don&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li>It blends in fast and rubs in to a clear gel like cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is all natural and organic and contains 25 cellulite fighting ingredients, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not experience any greasy residue with this product and after showering just applied it as a mere moisturizing agent and its worked great.</li>
            <li>have not quite used the product long enough to know if it works or not, but i do love the smell, texture, absorbability &amp; natual ingredients.</li>
            <li>I got very itchy and red bumps after first use that continued for days...</li>
            <li>After years of trying different products and a lot of money thrown out of the window, I finally found this product that I absolutely love so far (and it is not to pricey either).</li>
            <li>I did notice firmer skin after a few days, but better results will hopefully be shown after weeks of continuous usage.</li>
            <li>not sure if it really reduced cellulite, but you can feel how smooth the skin is!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product even if you dont have problem with cellulite, makes skin so firm:-)</li>
            <li>I rarely, if ever, eat fried foods, but struggle with my weakness which is definitely sweets.  </li>
            <li>in my opinion if its working its worth it though so will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try, I wish they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li>I only recommend products I think are worth sharing.</li>
            <li>If you always apply a cream nightly just place this where you would normally use your routine product.</li>
            <li>As for cellulite results, I will have to wait for a few weeks to be able to pronounce my verdict.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any burning, though it&#x27;s kind of thick and almost sticky after putting it on</li>
            <li>This cream is kind of thick</li>
            <li>The cream is nice and thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>Use as little because its concentrated and it works great to my skin and less my weight, although i am not overweight</li>
            <li>nivea gel works MUCH MUCH better and costs much less so learn from me and save your money!</li>
            <li>After using this lotion, within 4 weeks, the back of my thighs were much more smooth, very little dimpling, and only visible in certain lighting.</li>
            <li>Well I was totally floored by the amazing results I received from just using this product in less than 2 weeks along with using the body blaster scrub and massager.</li>
            <li>I have seen a slight improvement in cellulite so far, and hope to see more.</li>
            <li>it is super well protected so you can be sure you won&#x27;t be receiving a broken bottle.</li>
            <li>I mean nothing, has worked as effectively as this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your skin feel warm which I take to mean that there is some sweating going on, which could lead to a decrease in leg circumference.  </li>
            <li>NuElle was the next product I used and right away</li>
            <li>Buy it right now, I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I also have to start right off with I only did one ARM</li>
            <li>You should also wash your hands right away because they will feel gross.</li>
            <li>Also have been putting it on my double chin, couldn&#x27;t hurt right?</li>
            <li>This cellulite concentrate is rather different from others in a positive way!</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth trying I&#x27;m excited to see the difference after using it for a few months!</li>
            <li>That being said, it does seem that the ingredients in some firming lotions, including this one, do promote a firming of loose skin and accelerate subcutaneous fat loss more so than a standard moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li>Overall, I think NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate brings pretty much all the results it claims.</li>
            <li>but now it looks smooth and matches my other leg.</li>
            <li>My first bottle malfunction,  right away seller answer my email and in two days I received the other bottle.</li>
            <li>improve alot new results every week&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really feel it helps smooth and firm my legs and also seems to draw out some of the water weight.</li>
            <li>, it goes on light and absorbs quickly as long as I dry myself off well first.</li>
            <li>came today, the 10th, earlier than expected, so I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if this products actually works, it smells so much like a lemon scented cleaner (which I really don&#x27;t care for) that I won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed improvement in approximately two weeks and am happy to say that I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li>and I have tried and spent alot of money on many different products throughout the years.</li>
            <li>My problem area was mainly on one leg (thigh area) where I could clearly see the cellulite dimples under my skin</li>
            <li>I cannot really tell that it has really removed my cellulite, but I think combined with workout and proper food it will work well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle top can fall off and get this cream everywhere, so you have to be careful not to drop the bottle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell or the sticky feeling left on my skin which stayed that way even by the next morning.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference as far as cellulite.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will help you out with your confidence this product can definitely help at a decent price!!</li>
            <li>Rather than that, it makes it feel moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin very soft also.</li>
            <li>Your skins feels tacky for awhile until the lotion fully absorbs, then your skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>Made my skin very soft, so the crepy look is now gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and my cellulite are somewhat diminishing, however I have plenty of cellulite</li>
            <li>I eat clean, exercise and am not large but have always had issues with cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li>it was a little less expensive, but let&#x27;s face it the best products cost more.</li>
            <li>Within the first three days of using, I starting noticing my skin was firmer.</li>
            <li>First off let me say im one big skeptic for anything like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products but none come this close where I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a small difference, but mostly reordered it because I noticed a difference when I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>The cellulite in my upper arms have significantly diminished and the measurement around the upper arm area has shrank about 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this is the only anti-cellulite cream that really works!</li>
            <li>When my daughter was home for spring break last week, I was wearing shorts and it was the first thing she noticed -</li>
            <li>Like most cellulite creams, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I have now noticed a bigger improvement since I first reviewed the set.</li>
            <li>and it is such a hot topic among women.</li>
            <li>NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate contains a cocktail of 25 well known flub busters that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction!</li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s extreme \\&quot;silkiness\\&quot; is better tolerated with female&#x27;s skin than males.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t take long to see results too…and I must say that it is worth checking out and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have ordered 3 so far!</li>
            <li>As for my contribution, I eat lots of fruits and vegetables, drink mostly water, coffee in the morning and an occasional glass of white or red wine at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now with consistent and noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle and have ordered a second.</li>
            <li>I bought similar products in Europe and was excited to see this on the American market.</li>
            <li>I am going to stay with this now, but you have to be aware that no cream will take away your cellulite totally</li>
            <li>The first time i used it,i was surprise by the lasting diuretic effect</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin feeling soft!  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin is so soft from this product!</li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still there, but I am confident that with the continued use of this product I&#x27;ll  be able to wear me some short shorts this summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty big girl</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Like many other women out there, I have tried every product you can possibly imagine for cellulite treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Still, the seller gave me full refund minus shipping.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using it and highly recommend anybody who wants to get rid of cellulite to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>states that it firms, tightens, detoxifies skin inside and out, reduces water retention, improves circulation and the look and feel of your skin, which are all common needs for the average person and this is great if it does all</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply, within a few weeks I saw a drastic difference.</li>
            <li>There is a controlled pumped for the amount of the product released, and that is nice so that you don&#x27;t overuse the product (believe me a little goes a long way!).</li>
            <li>I only use organic and natural oils and creams on my skin/face/body, and that is what first attracted me to this cream.</li>
            <li>Nuelle Triple Action Concentrate actually does work, I have been  surprised and the price is so much better than&lt;br /&gt;the other product.  </li>
            <li>The price is right for this considering that it goes a long way and shows results!</li>
            <li>Less expensive than some others that call themselves ‘best’</li>
            <li>actually are looking more toned and way, way less dimples than when I started</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with clear instructions and I noticed results within a few days.  </li>
            <li>It kind of just sits on the skin making it very hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>My tip is to place it in the shower so when you are done and dry off you can apply it right in the shower.</li>
            <li>I work out consistently and eat right and have actually started working out even harder and still no difference.</li>
            <li>but I have opted to use it solely on certain areas such as my thighs, butt and stomach.</li>
            <li>The thights feel different, more tight</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in the areas with little dimples.</li>
            <li>I like the texture, non-greasy, soaks into the skin but not too quickly to enjoy a little massage.</li>
            <li>So, thank you to the attentive seller for the correct information, and for a little lesson in engineering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using cocoa butter and nivea ultra concentrated serum before this and was starting to see some noticeable results so decided to spend a little more and buy this.  </li>
            <li>The cream is thick and a little sticky but absorbs great.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it has only been a little more than a week, so</li>
            <li>For 100% results it will take100% of hard work and dedication, not just a magic cream.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday on my stomach and thighs and within a week I can see a huge difference in the tone and cellulite .  </li>
            <li>You are not gonna waste anything, a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a HUGE improvement in the tone/texture of my thighs and waste line.  </li>
            <li>I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  </li>
            <li>I have been using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate as part of my daily routine to get in beach ready shape.</li>
            <li>So far I have used 3 bottles, and after the second one, I really started noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>So far I like this</li>
            <li>Using this will keep that person you don&#x27;t want at the party busy on someone else&#x27;s thighs, butt, arms and gut.</li>
            <li>The cream also makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Although no product will completely take away cellulite, I can see it helps in the reduction in appearance.</li>
            <li>Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li>my skin felt amazingly soft...</li>
            <li>I have been using #NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Firming Concentrate with 25 flub busters for 2 weeks now,  in place of my nightly lotion.</li>
            <li>So far this is working for me.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks there has been no change as far as cellulite but my skin tone has Improved some.</li>
            <li>it takes several weeks, so I did purchase another bottle to really give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thin, work out 6 days a week, drink a butt ton of water, &amp; generally eat pretty healthy</li>
            <li>This is so far my fav creme &amp; i have been experimenting for years.</li>
            <li>which I was really surprised about.  </li>
            <li>Since using this, my skin feels softer and smoother, but I can&#x27;t say the dimples are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream&lt;</li>
            <li>I rub it in until it completely dissappears into my skin.</li>
            <li>I am almost 40 years old</li>
            <li>It does smooth and firm up my arms and never want to be without it again.</li>
            <li>However, I am still a woman, 38 years old, and have had a baby.</li>
            <li>They ship extremely fast and its shipped proper.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve noticed my legs are firmer</li>
            <li>I am very slim, but there is cellulite dimples on my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this product based on the reviews but the &amp;#34;odd smell&amp;#34; lingers with you for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>leaves your skin silky soft and does help diminish cellulite and tighten the skin on my thighs if used every day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife, she is using it everyday, and i have seen the results, her skin looks thighter and looks smooth..</li>
            <li>I have been using the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for over a month.</li>
            <li>I use it religiously two times a day For two weeks straight.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin ridiculously soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have used the concentrate for several months now and i can really tell a difference when i go without applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I  am 40 years old and about 20 lbs.</li>
            <li>The one perk that I did like about this was it made me feel soft for an extended period of time-</li>
            <li>BTW, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and weigh 112 lbs - have had cellulite since my late teens and workout 5x/week, eat a healthy diet but still cannot get rid of the cellulite.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only so much that can be done against the forces of time</li>
            <li>Oh also my skin has never felt so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>You should definitely try both if you can because the skin feels really refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smoother and nore soft.</li>
            <li>That time I did not pay much attention to it, but years passed, a baby appeared in our family and all those cellulite spots became obvious.</li>
            <li>, I like how my skin becomes firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>To my delight, the combo really helped and I saw encouraging results in a relatively short time (three weeks).</li>
            <li>I had to go back to my 3d product that really gave me that look and confidence after 15yrs to wear shorts again.  </li>
            <li>Triple Action Anti celluite concentrate</li>
            <li>I try to exercise at least 3 times a week and eat healthy.</li>
            <li>My cellulite is almost gone, and I am over 30 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a ton of natural ingredients, like caffeine, flower extracts, herbs and vitamins.</li>
            <li>Before I came across with NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate, I used Clarins products, the oil and the cream.  </li>
            <li>I am a fit person with a few stubborn areas of cellulite, so I had hoped this product would help me out.  </li>
            <li>It even stays soft after showering again.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff has won by far.</li>
            <li>Plus it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thighs felt like a silk and skin became smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>It was like it had not dried.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products with ingredients from nature which has not been tampered with.</li>
            <li>NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate creates a sauna effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About me: I&#x27;m a 25 year old male(guys get cellulite too)</li>
            <li>I started noticing cellulite on the sides of my stomach, near my arm pits, and on my stomach.</li>
            <li>Now let me say, this doesn&#x27;t get rid of cellulite completely, but I can already see a drastic improvement in the way</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>At night, after using the scrub on my hands, I apply this concentrate and wear gloves to keep my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>One should find what works for him/her and stick to it, only then we can achieve real result.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the clear difference on my skin looking after I used the product for probably 6 times.</li>
            <li>However, as far as reducing cellulite, it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a cellulite -free skin even after having my kid.i&#x27;m heavily into fitness and consider myself a bit of a workout \\&quot;freak\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I also  believe the effects of NuElle Triple Action Cream will be complimented by diet and exercice.</li>
            <li>Well, surprise, surprise, surprise after using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for two months</li>
            <li>with some simple diet results will be fast.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel so soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the NuElle triple action anti cellulite concentrate for approx.</li>
            <li>Old stretch marks and some scars have lightened quite a bit.</li>
            <li>So far, i am using for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Ive been using this formulation for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and this has not bothered my skin at all</li>
            <li>and I like all the natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>my thighs were baby soft and the cellulite smoothed out within about a week.  </li>
            <li>this is my second time using this product, and I absolutely vouch for the results.</li>
            <li>Just finished up 2 bottle of this nuelle stuff using it 2x a day, nearly every day since Valentine Day.</li>
            <li>but i was unexpectedly surprised.</li>
            <li>It has a really cool feeling that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate definitely made my thighs and buttocks area more firm.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not very good--not terrible--but it doesn&#x27;t linger after the lotion is absorbed.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, It doesn&#x27;t require wrapping, stays on the skin firm and doesn&#x27;t leave the dry after-feeling.</li>
            <li>When I use it once daily, the appearance of my cellulite reduces by more than half, but when I use it twice a day (as the manufacturer recommends), I can barely notice any cellulite dimples.</li>
            <li>, I see some improvement on my cellulite specially when I use the cream every single day ( I usually only apply once a day)</li>
            <li>Just the other day when I was sitting, I happened to glance at my thighs ( had on pants), they actually looked fit and toned.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and so far I have noticed the back of my legs are way firmer and any small cellulite is definitely reducing in appearance!</li>
            <li>far as how long this bottle would last you, I’d say it depends on how much you’re using and how much area you’re covering.</li>
            <li>I love how a little amount goes a long way</li>
            <li>I blame that due to a bad diet (I do love me some good beer!) and not being as active as I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never have thought it&#x27;d be possible for me to appear so lean, I&#x27;ve gained more definition in the last two years than I had in the previous seven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never have thought it&#x27;d be possible for me to appear so lean, I&#x27;ve gained more definition in the last two years than I had in the previous seven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff personally does not work and I barely have that much cellulite</li>
            <li>I just received my second order and I am trying the scrub that goes along with this particular product.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, because so many creams and lotions don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all when you apply them.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually ordered a second bottle of any cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I (for the first time ever) had this unsightly cellulite on my inner thighs and above my knees.</li>
            <li>I know from past experience that caffeine and seaweed extracts work for me, but I had never seen a product with so many essential oils (juniper, cinnamon, cayenne and wintergreen oils</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see more in the next few weeks!</li>
            <li>This product in particular Im using for my 2nd time around along with their skin firming cream and its a delight to put on</li>
            <li>In our era of chemical overload, being all natural is a major plus too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried two other products of lesser value, used them exactly as was indicated in the bottles, and they didn&#x27;t really do anything for me (Jergens Skin Firming and Nivea Body Good-bye Cellulite).</li>
            <li>It is a diuretic, improves circulation, reduces the appearance of cellulite overtime, firming, detoxifying, organic and all natural which is a major factor for me.</li>
            <li>The cream is not extremely greasy and leaves skin soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream if you&#x27;re looking to lighten stretch marks, get rid of cellulite and tone up your skin overall.</li>
            <li>I’m going on another cruise next year and unlike my previous cruise, I plan to look fit and trim in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li>but I noticed immediatelly that this does not dry fast enough and it smells.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a HUGE difference in how firm my thighs were!</li>
            <li>I am on my fourth bottle, and not only has my cellulite diminished, but my skin is also more firm.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, the cellulite has diminished slightly and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>As a new mom in my 30s, I am trying to get back into a bikini-worthy shape.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased based upon the reviews and used the entire bottle as directed with absolutely zero results.</li>
            <li>Its kind of crazy to think they can make this stuff to really work.</li>
            <li>noticed the diuretic properties pretty fast since it did make me sweat slightly the first few days of using it.</li>
            <li>and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very subtle, pleasant scent, sort of like a very mild green tea-like fragrance, but not overpowering at all like some green tea perfumes.</li>
            <li>little by little I started seeing more and more improvements, I have to say I use it twice a day and at least once a day I massage the area using Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed like I noticed some improved tone, but the cellulite was still very apparent.</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews on Amazon people said they liked the smell of this product, however when I read other reviews I saw comments about the smell being strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I used two different brands of anti-cellulite products immediately after the other and this product from Skin QR Organics worked better for me; the other product made my eczema flare up</li>
            <li>If you are truly looking to get rid of that Cellulite, look no further than NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>However the product is not magic, you must decrease processed sugar and high sodium foods, drink lots of water, along with exercising to see quick and lasting results.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount goes a long way and in my personal case, it has worked far better than what my expectations were.  </li>
            <li>So then I tried NuElle, with fear that I would lose more money... and soon enough, I actually started feeling a difference after a few weeks when I realized there truly was a visual improvement.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other lotions and potions-none of them firm and get rid of my cellulite like this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a creamy but not oily feel, so I can use it right after the shower and not be afraid to have to wait until it soaks in (like some other AC products) and I can put my clothes on right away (since time is always short in the mornings).  </li>
            <li>I only wish that they made a SUPER sized bottle of this stuff because 5oz does not go a long way, especially if you used it twice daily like it says.</li>
            <li>There was a slight tingle sensation which showed the product was really working to get down into the areas where it needed to be and the product left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>When clean eating and excising was not enough, NuElle helped me reduce fat and get firm.</li>
            <li>I have used several different products before and I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, only once a day usually (not the recommended twice a day) and seeing positive results!</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>I probably haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really say it works.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I wouldn&#x27;t keep coming back to purchase if I didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li>Also the price is reasonable and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>I wore it with some tights to help tighten back e flabby fats but have not seen any measurement improvements so far</li>
            <li>Actually I just bought my second bottle earlier this month because I&#x27;ve been using it so much.</li>
            <li>So far I have used one bottle of this and am currently on my second one.</li>
            <li>You can barely see it.</li>
            <li>Woman carry extra weight in the thigh area naturally.</li>
            <li>I had been using another well known firming cream and the results were only a modest 10 -15% improvement.  </li>
            <li>I recently had the chance to review a bottle of NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate.</li>
            <li>but there was enough there to make me self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old female.</li>
            <li>Barely a month into using it</li>
            <li>I am 29, so I feel old enough to start worrying about cellulite.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only found two creams that do this, this is one of them.</li>
            <li>I have been using NuElle Tripple Action Anti Cellulite cream for several years.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate because it does the job.</li>
            <li>The smell is similar to an old B&amp;BW Lemon Meringue body creams that I used to use.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;2, 36 years old BF and currently weigh 122 pounds.  </li>
            <li>But I have never had any allergies and eat very heathy (minimal salt and sugar</li>
            <li>it might be too early to give a final conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely saw any results, if any.</li>
            <li>I knew very well from last time I had managed to properly reduce it, that only a combination of factors plus perseverance can make it go away.</li>
            <li>My cellulite has not disappeared completely and I will not try to be delusional and expect that it can happen, but I believe that I see some improvement when it comes to ripple look on the back of my thighs and firmness of the skin.</li>
            <li>I used it on my upper arms, stomach, and legs and bum, applying it at least once a day in the evenings, but twice a day when I could remember, and started noticing that the areas seemed tighter and more even after around 2 weeks, and by 4 weeks there was definitely a noticable difference!</li>
            <li>It is thick, and has a light smell.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of all products of this kind</li>
            <li>can honestly attest to the fact that because I have used this product my upper thighs, and bottom now have a much decreased visual appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping it would work but prepared for disappointment since one often hears the refrain, “If something sounds too good to be true….”  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other cellulite creams over the last year and some seemed to work a little bit</li>
            <li>That other jar of cream runs out seemingly a little faster, but I had much better results and much faster results, so I will be going back to the other cream again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle which lasted 3 and a half weeks using it twice a day from ankles to butt.</li>
            <li>The cream gives your skin a &amp;#34;pump,&amp;#34; so your dimples look much less noticeable even just after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have used many other creams in the past (fat girl scrub from Bliss, homemade mixtures, Nivea anti-C serum AND lotion)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this cellulite cream, and have noticed a major difference in the quality of my skin on my thighs and butt!</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent but not strong at all, and its a scent that is refreshing to have on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a good smell like some I&#x27;ve had but not horrible and disturbing for sure.</li>
            <li>just  received some samples of other products and very exited  to test out.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t really have an answer for me, except that maybe I am allergic or retaining water due to salty food/sodium intake/ stress/ monthly cycle.</li>
            <li>Unlike other gels I have used in the past, this product is a thick, silky cream that allows a fairly lengthy massage before being absorbed completely (that in itself provides half the benefit).</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped with the little bit extra I needed since I am a clean eater and exercise regularly already.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that my cellulite is very minimal so that may be why I can already see results, but this product really does work.</li>
            <li>The product is all natural and organic and is formulated to not only work on the outside of your skin but deeper into the skin layers as well.</li>
            <li>Not a waste of money actually the opposite!!  </li>
            <li>The older I get, the harder it is to keep up with time and its consequences.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very complete formula compared to more expensive brands; I just wish there was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation isn&#x27;t very strong with this product, and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable, unbearable, or something that would prevent you from wanting to use it.  </li>
            <li>Before using the NuElle product the ripples of my cellulite were visible through some of my tighter fitting pants -- not a good look!  </li>
            <li>You will notice some firming right after using it, but this only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have tried expensive and mainstreet treatments and many in between, with little success.</li>
            <li>(Also, not sure if they do anything more or less than this one).</li>
            <li>I began using firming lotions in the beginning of 2010, twice a day, every day, in an effort to get rid of some stubborn inches around my torso left over from the years of less than stellar eating.</li>
            <li>generally apply it once a day, but when i remember to do the second application i can notice faster results.  </li>
            <li>I generally use it twice daily and massage for 1 minute morning &amp; night.</li>
            <li>The texture was a bit lighter than other regular lotions which did not make it greasy but very absorbent.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d have to use it for at least a full month or two.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt firmer after the first few applications.</li>
            <li>have tried other creams before, cheap and expensive, but have found that this one actually works better than my other current cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to stick to a regimen if I don&#x27;t see results fairly quick.</li>
            <li>i usually put it on right before yoga or work-outs.</li>
            <li>What I like about this cream is that my thigh and backside skin has become tighter, so much softer, and the dimples are a lot less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Once it soaks in, it does feel slightly tacky to the touch, but that is a small thing compared to the benefits and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, after only a week or so of using it twice daily (most days-</li>
            <li>I used the the first bottle and noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin within a few days.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many creams, gels, and serums ranging from reasonably priced to very expensive.</li>
            <li>The other reason I apply this in the morning is because it is really quite heavy; on one hand my (male) skin stays unbelievable soft, even 8-12 hours later when I apply the other, more absorbent lotion.</li>
            <li>They send you a free sample with ever purchase, and a small magazine with all of their other spa products.</li>
            <li>and that kind of restriction is a little tough to be mindful of.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I actually saw results within the first few weeks!!!!</li>
            <li>so I was so surprise when I noticed significant difference on my skin in just a few weeks, smoother and less rippled.</li>
            <li>fat?).The most amazing thing for me about this cream is its firming action.my skin is firmer and the ugly little fatty bumps are not growing any bigger.</li>

            <li> Kind of wigs my dogs out!</li>
            <li> So It was like about 3 months ago that I decided to commit myself to exercising, drinking more water, eating healthier and LOOKING FOR THE BEST CREAM to get rid of cellulite....</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to reduce the appearance of cellulite and this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> i have tried many cellulite creams and find this one to be one of the best.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have found what works for me!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn but it almost feels like you have a warm heating blanket on!</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-cellulite creams (including the \\&quot;the best seller\\&quot; finulite... what a scam!!)</li>
            <li> It works and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li> Impressive list of healthy ingredients that work.</li>
            <li> I felt absolutely confident that my body looks great!</li>
            <li> Very good smell, and perfect consistency for a quick massage with no residue.</li>
            <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews I was very excited when I received my product.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite has never been something pleasant to look at or have –</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, but it not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> On top of it the price is very good, it comes in a discrete packaging and</li>
            <li> I love it, smells nice and does the perfect job!</li>
            <li> It smells great and applies nicely.</li>
            <li> Size is good too.</li>
            <li> did my research and after trying another product for 2 months, I didn&#x27;t get any good results ....  </li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good cream.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Its as good price, too.</li>
            <li> Cellulite runs in my family, and after the good results I even bought one for my sister</li>
            <li> It smells really good and works.  </li>
            <li> One good thing about it is it smells good.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like I am getting a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Of course like everything you have to help the product having a good diet and doing some exercise.</li>
            <li> I tried it because of all the good reviews it got; but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it also smells good.</li>
            <li> It has great smell, nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I saw as good of a result.</li>
            <li> nothing good to say, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> But, no matter how good I am, I always have some cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I think NuElle cellulite cream is a good product.</li>
            <li> Like I said, not a miracle product, but still is good if your cellulite isn&#x27;t too</li>
            <li> This product is really good.</li>
            <li> Even after a gap of 2-3 weeks it still looks good.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients and incredibly effective product.  </li>
            <li> I loved the results and I&#x27;m even buying this product for my mother now.</li>
            <li> But it smells good, good consistency and good absorption.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue to use the products and see just how great my legs can look!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s too soon to tell how effective it will be, I can say that the cream is pleasantly fragranced  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Also I was very happy with how quickly the product arrived.</li>
            <li> Great product. :-)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> Combined with Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz I have been getting amazing results.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star because it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had honestly given up all hope of any help or cure .</li>
            <li> The lotion does have a nice warming sensation, it smells ‘spa-like,’ and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li> lotion has a nice fragrance and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> but after you get used to it, it is kind of Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to be honest when I say it works.  </li>

            <li> Nice smell,</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like lemons to me).</li>
            <li> The bottle says it may create a warm sensation, but I didn&#x27;t get anything like that.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say NuElle</li>
            <li> I order this product for my wife, and it works effectively on her skin problem.</li>

            <li> I have been searching for an effective Anti Cellulite cream for years, and this is absolutely the BEST product on the market.</li>
            <li> this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try since I saw many good reviews on Amazon... and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The cream is organic, light and fast absorbing;it has great ingredients and a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The cocktail of 25 plant extracts is unique among cellulite treatments and provides great moisturizing effect in addition to cellulite blasting.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it in the mail!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it - very light and pleasant...</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the great thing about this product is that it does more than just reduce cellulite (which after continued use) will be visible to see.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it smells lovely, absolutely lovely, a wonderful sort of fresh citrusy smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and is also super conditioning</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t worked for me and has a very strong smell</li>
            <li> This cream has shown the best results by far!</li>
            <li> This item seems to contain the right ingredients to fight cellulite, but the best I can say for it is that it does make your skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream about 2 month ago, and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely so far the best product I&#x27;ve tried for the prevention of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I used to use another kind more but it takes forever to soak in.</li>
            <li> I thought because I paid more it would work faster and have amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product well over a year now and can honestly say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The best anti cellulite cream so far.</li>
            <li> As far this is one of the best anti cellulite products I have used.</li>
            <li> Very happy so far have gone through one bottle.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely erased&lt;br /&gt;my cellulite, but the appearance is greatly improved!</li>
            <li> This one by far, works the very best.  </li>
            <li> I remember when I was at school my aunt was in direct sales and was introducing women beauty items, and that time she told me that her anti-cellulite products were her best sellers.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective product to reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I liked and like the way she looks because I love her, and I don&#x27;t understand why all women are so preoccupied with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I love this product along with the scrub.</li>
            <li> It smells good which is a plus, it feels light and all that deserves 4 stars for now.</li>
            <li> I am a competitive national bikini competitor, so I live a healthy lifestyle of exercise and perfect diets.</li>
            <li> It is super refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> love the light pleasant scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, has many herbal ingredients, and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> but I was happy I am doing the right thing in my fight with cellulite.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, REALLY work and work so quickly!</li>
            <li> for quite a while, and Nuelle by far is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Of course, I believe you should also complement the cream with some exercise and/or a kind of healthy diet to help the product work better.</li>
            <li> The smell is fabulous, the consistency is perfect, andbest of all it really reduces cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product contains top 20+ well known botanical cellulite fighting ingredients, which is amazing in and of itself.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and it makes your skin even more soft and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy absorptive  and smell god ,and after using  him ,my  skin look  better.</li>
            <li> This product had a very rich consistency that made it very easy to massage into my skin..</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also very refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> Another great thing is that the size is pretty generous for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I bought this item fair and square, full price plus shipping, no discount or incentive from this site.</li>
            <li> It is very important for me that products I use are organic and work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy but very light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, 120 lbs and very fit.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and rubs in easily</li>
            <li> This product is easy to rub in and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> BUT IT DID NOT ONE BIT OF GOOD FOR MY MILD CELLULITE.</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice scent and seems to work nicely.</li>
            <li> but I do see a huge difference in my stomach!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have noticed firmer more toned skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Before this one I was using Vichy&#x27;s products, and I think this is better.</li>
            <li> I also love all the healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite Looks about 50% better with using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it does look better.  </li>
            <li> It feels refreshing to your skin.</li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;re all looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that makes us feel better about ourselves.  </li>
            <li> I am sure as I continue using Skin QR Organics –</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love the sample eye cream I receive with every purchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion contains a cocktail of 25 well known &amp;#34;flub Busters&amp;#34; that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction like caffeine, Butchers Broom, Bladderwrack, ivy and many others.</li>
            <li> ok, its supposed to feel that way.</li>
            <li> I also know, that I need to hydrate more than I do.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am gaining muscle where it was a lot of fat, but the jiggle tightened up and to me that is a magic.</li>
            <li> I would keep using until I attain the desired goal and recommend this to anyone dealing with jiggly areas :)</li>
            <li> so hopefully as I continue using it it&#x27;ll go away even more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I scrub the better outcome will be.</li>
            <li> and I want to see more results.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that after I put it on, it had an interesting heating effect.  </li>
            <li> but u also need to workout to see the better result.</li>
            <li> They state that you should eat healthy and exercise for this product to work.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found organic works better for my body.</li>
            <li> I was %100 satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with this cellulite treatment cream.</li>
            <li> The smell could be better</li>
            <li> I apply once a day after I shower and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> the cherry on top...</li>
            <li> Update after one month of use: While NuElle won&#x27;t make your cellulite magically disappear, it does have a noticeable effect after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied of this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  replace healthy  eating and exercise to lose weight.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> effect to make you sweat more in areas you apply it to burn fat.</li>
            <li> have been looking better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy and has a kind of shininess to it that almost looks like it</li>
            <li> did receive this product free from Tomoson but the experience and opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing</li>
            <li> But it has to be team work, eat healthy and exercise.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i recommend  it a 100%</li>
            <li> and I eat in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> However, all the ppl saying it smells refreshing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even close to refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good natural alternative also, so you can feel good about that as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I did do what another person did and use it with the Avalon Organics CoQ 10 firming lotion and got lovely results.</li>
            <li> so I can stay on top of it and not run out.</li>
            <li> Smell is OK, but who cares, I like the results.</li>
            <li> My legs need a bit more work, but there has been improvement.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using with some sort of skin massager for faster and better results.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions though, for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li> and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This product contains over 20 botanical cellulite fighting agents to help give you the best looking skin possible for your body.</li>
            <li> I love having a product that is organic that I can use.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Will use it more to see how well it works on cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, and have ordered multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that helps as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered more</li>
            <li> ok but didn&#x27;t do anything for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I also love the seaweed scrub</li>
            <li> I love wearing shorts now.  </li>
            <li> Must try for banishing cellulite!! :)</li>
            <li> Had better luck with Nivea.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are not laden with chemicals, looking forward to trying more products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now, and totally love it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of NuElle&#x27;s cellulite tx, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> , seeing these results I have ordered more bottles today.</li>
            <li> With continued use 2x a day, skin tone gets better and better.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is organic also.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells ok by me.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best cellulite lotion I have come across.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients</li>
            <li> , I also tried the body scrub and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I noticed this one works way better</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> and i see a difference in my thighs this product really works and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This one beats the others for sure.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the body blaster to my routine to see if the results are even greater.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that I will see even more results by the spring.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, even my husband noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It really works and feels great.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best cellulite product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This has helped her a lot reducing the cellulite, of course it isn&#x27;t magical.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
            <li> There was a product I tried before that worked much better.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.</li>
            <li> It gets better with time.</li>
            <li> It has many ingredients which are proven to help eliminate the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for a while</li>
            <li> Anti-Cellulite sounds like a magic to me.</li>
            <li> Even my jeans seem to be fitting better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to be more pro-active</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I use to work out a lot more</li>
            <li> so the more</li>
            <li> I guess it would be better</li>
            <li> , you must change your lifestyle as in eating healthy and working out...</li>
            <li> Although I am within a healthy weight I have had cellulite in my legs since age 12... and nothing has worked until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more than 20 lbs over weight nor have I ever had a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have also applied around the eyes to some effect but a dedicated caffeine based eye-cream works much better.</li>
            <li> I have also applied around the eyes to some effect but a dedicated caffeine based eye-cream works much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used SO many products that claim to work, but I have never noticed results like this before.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I have had a better outcome with their seaweed scrub.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best cellulite products on the market, and for the price</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and smells great.</li>
            <li> But most of us deal with it, so what are we supposed to do about it?</li>
            <li> The company says the combination of these ingredients will reduce the appearance of cellulite within 2-3 weeks for most users.</li>
            <li> but then most experiments are a hit or a miss</li>
            <li> I will use this bottle twice a day, and I hope to receive even better results.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will continue delivering with continuous use.</li>
            <li> so I need lots more work with them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also make sure I exfoliate my skin in the shower because I feel that the cream absorbs better that way.  </li>
            <li> This product is my favorite from Amazon to date.  </li>
            <li> Sure there is some noticeable improvement but with the eating regimen(use  </li>
            <li> not buy again, will just exercise more, cut out a lot of carbs and massage tush/thigh area with a massage mitt.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product that I have come to really enjoy.</li>
            <li> If you are sitting on the fence, give this one a try because unlike many products, this one is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t ever stop making it please :)</li>
            <li> So, I feel like I am trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I am sure that helped too.</li>
            <li> and I will surely pick up another bottle once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> My skin was so much more radiant and shiny, felt tighter and softer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that promise results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to do more lunges and squats &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think I sweat more this way</li>
            <li> so it probably works better.</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> By now I have tried many cellulite treatments under the sun and this one takes the cake, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Of course, I used it together with a workout routine (I jogged 3 miles 2 to 3 times a week) and was more mindful of my diet.</li>
            <li> Not only have I seen improvements in the 4 weeks I have been using it, but I love that it is made with all the very best ingredients!</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products and this one truly made a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this and will never switch to another product again.</li>
            <li> and after a week I was able to see my skin improving.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle</li>
            <li> My legs look more defined.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying the way my legs feel</li>
            <li> , they feel smooth and my skin texture is nice and supple.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using to take advantage of the improved circulation and more toned look</li>
            <li> The smell is ok with me, and I don&#x27;t notice a tingle.</li>
            <li> Much better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to try yet another creme.  </li>
            <li> I am a fitness bikini competitor and I have been looking for a product the reduce my cellulite or make it disappear (even better)</li>
            <li> I love the mint smell</li>
            <li> and I love this spa quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen many results.</li>
            <li> AND I TRULY TRUST AND LOVE</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I simply love it.  </li>
            <li> I received another order of this today and will continue to purchase more.  </li>
            <li> and I love its smell, too.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the products in market.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this cellulite, body cream.</li>
            <li> I have maintained a healthy weight, and try to stick to a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li> 5 Stars, more like 100 Stars.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> As I have used more than one bottle, I see the results work every time I use it.</li>
            <li> When I returned the cellulite had returned to her buttocks/hip area, but the front of her thighs looked better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t factitiously claim that the fat will go away even if you stop working out or managing your healthy diet and that this product will miraculously burn away your fat forever.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having tried many products over many years, I had settled on St. Ives cellulite shield, which I did think helped somewhat, then they stopped making it</li>
            <li> They are smoother and firmer and look much better.</li>
            <li> ripples I had are not so visible any more.</li>
            <li> The lemon citrus scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance...absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li> ...looks better...</li>
            <li> this makes you feel better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You have to use it continuously, but you should moisturize anyway, so you get an awesome double benefit!</li>
            <li> it has it in more things to fight the flab than any I have used yet .</li>
            <li> My mistake, my goofy self should of read more on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do try to eat healthy all the time, but have to admit those potato chips and soda</li>
            <li> It also gives your skin a fresh cooling feeling which I loved.</li>
            <li> My skin looks a lot more even and my skin looks firmer.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> After reading some more, it did say that it has a diuretic effect and it works both on the surface and in depth.</li>
            <li> I think with continuous use there may be even more improvement.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this product</li>
            <li> This gives me approximately 2 more months.</li>
            <li> I used to just deal with it because I knew it was mostly genetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the exercising has helped as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and more toned.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel nice and smooth with some of the best  quality products on the market definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> AND I APPRECIATE THE INGREDIENTS ARE HEALTHY</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feel tighter for sure.</li>
            <li> so I know it will take a lot more than wearing this lotion to reduce them.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 6 different brands of cellulite creams and this one works the best!  </li>
            <li> It not only takes care of cellulite, but smells great and is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just love it and started to see results in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product when used and understood properly, and by that</li>
            <li> It does work, I have just ordered 3 more bottles, even though I have to pay delivery to Madrid</li>
            <li> My best friend later on bought me</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using it and buying another one just to be sure that improvement continues.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this lotion for about 6 months now and love it a lot.</li>
            <li> After a month, twice a day, I seen results, my skin looked better.  </li>
            <li> i like this lotion and probably will buy more when i finish my bottle.</li>
            <li> use it every day with a cellulite brush and along with an intense exercise routine, it has greatly helped me reduce my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have always eaten in moderation, maintained a healthy weight, and exercise 5-6 times per week; but that did not prevent me from inheriting my mom&#x27;s cottage cheese butt/thighs.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell (smells like a spa) and the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Their concentrate boasts 25 of the best cellulite fighting ingredients such as: Caffeine, L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10,</li>
            <li> Then it magically felt better and healed faster.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> While the results aren&#x27;t drastic, I&#x27;m confident I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin look much better and healthier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> For the cost I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to work for me :)</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and pleasant and goes on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> But this product has definitely made an improvement, along with the massager which I love!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant to use--a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This kind absorbs much more quickly so I can put on pants instead of standing around forever or having my pants stuck to my legs when I stand up.</li>
            <li> This creme goes on very smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> Not too strongly fragranced, goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice sweet smell also which I like.  </li>
            <li> and they both loved it so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cellulite cream for over a month now and am so excited with the results!  </li>
            <li> and yet I would still see significant results!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> New great find for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is strong though.  </li>
            <li> The smell is clean and refreshing and the texture fells smooth and warm.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a strong scent that may not be appealing to everyone</li>
            <li> well I should&#x27;ve known better when most reviewers were given free stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this product line is the best I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> I only use once per day with very good results.</li>
            <li> Very very cool.  </li>
            <li> I love how light this cream is when applied.  </li>
            <li> I have also tries fat girl slim and cellulean and this is the best!</li>
            <li> but I am totally happy with the #NuElle Cream so far.</li>
            <li> my skin DID look and feel more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think what&#x27;s most important is that the product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy that I found NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate from Skin QR Organics.</li>
            <li> Not only it is made just with NATURAL ingredients but also has the perfect consistency to perform a good massage in my problem areas. ....</li>
            <li> I will update and happily change to 5 stars, if by chance; this product completely exonerates my \\&quot;problem.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and leaves skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to watch your fat and sodium intake, fighting cellulite takes more than slapping on a cream.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing my skin becoming firmer and the dimples disappearing</li>
            <li> It was great to see that the instructions were clear of when to apply lotion, so that you get the results.</li>
            <li> and I foresee this becoming a permanent part of my beauty routine akin to night cream and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I came across this NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it&#x27;s not sticky, and makes my skin feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> but after one week I noticed my skin becoming firmer from using this product.</li>
            <li> Loved the results and ran out and really saw the improvements that the product made since I ran out.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I ordered another bottle to have when I finish this one.</li>
            <li> good and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It also has a nice fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are super clean , amazingly effective and I love how my skin drinks it in.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft and smooth plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and my skin looks more tight.</li>
            <li> I also have purchased the seaweed scrub, which I use all over my body, and is great on my face since it&#x27;s a fine grain scrub and has natural oils that moisturize also.</li>
            <li> I had the best results with thing product comparing to other brands.</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to use more.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of amazing how soft it made my skin feel,</li>
            <li> It’s easily lasts a month and twenty something dollar investment per month is nothing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the scrub mitten because I am an easy bruiser.</li>
            <li> Definitely got the results and more And a great deal too.</li>
            <li> I get up in the morning, take a shower, put the cream on, and wait one hour (which is easy because I&#x27;m fixing my hair, putting makeup on, getting dressed, etc.)</li>
            <li> 2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal (easy for me because I eat 6 meals per day, every 3 hours).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordering was easy and I received the product promptly.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser made it easy to use and portable</li>
            <li> When I applied it, it smelled great, and I was able to feel it actually working!</li>
            <li> I think this works good as a skin tightening cream more than a cream that gets rid of cellulite completely...</li>
            <li> And they are VERY quick to deliver they&#x27;re products as well.</li>
            <li> and it has a strong odor</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s strong when you apply it but does stay in your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural which I love and it works which I love more!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it smells good</li>
            <li> service is also great, i had an issue with one of the bottles i ordered and they replaced it right away, very friendly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the pump bottle is really nice and gives you a consistent amount each time.</li>
            <li> This organic cellulite firming lotion is the first I have tried in its kind.</li>
            <li> It is also very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> This treatment is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and looking forward to trying other products!</li>
            <li> While exercises can bring significant upgrades to cellulite areas, I know that I should consider the right and effective products for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If you want a little help smoothing out your skin in problem areas (mine are thighs), this product does a great job in conjunction with healthy eating and focused workouts!</li>
            <li> it really helps you sweat more and shed the bloat!</li>
            <li> So much so that I started using it on my neck, I love that tightening feeling!</li>
            <li> I rated this cream a 3 because it does a great job of making your skin super soft</li>
            <li> I like the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate citrus smell, light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> and it dries super fast!!!!  </li>
            <li> The main indicator for me that something is happening is that when I stand in strong overhead light (sunlight, some dressing rooms--what are they thinking?!?!)</li>
            <li> I think it works best on people who needs to tone up their body a little.</li>
            <li> I ran out and ordered 3 more containers before the first one I ordered ran out!  </li>
            <li> How amazing to have a smooth, tight skin and proudly wear your swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a huge bottle at 5oz, 150 ml.</li>
            <li> Love it... feels nice on skin and not messy... tightens skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement with her cellulite.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed the huge difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my thighs by just looking</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see a huge result yet, but</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a huge reduction in mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, twice a day every day as suggested on the label, and haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but there is a difference.</li>
            <li> Not only have a noticed a huge change in my cellulite, but this product smells great.</li>
            <li> The bottle you get is huge.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz twice already, and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> The cream is light, smoothing and absorbent.  </li>
            <li> It is a smooth cream</li>
            <li> I used it at night before bed and used an electric light heated massage in a circular motion to hopefully increase the acceptance of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I got this product free for a review.</li>
            <li> and I have DEFINITELY seen great results.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love the outcome so far..</li>
            <li> Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiant Skin Gradual Tan Moisturizer all over just to make sure the product gets fully absorbed on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can proudly wear short shorts and a bikini without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample for this review.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> It spreads well and leave my skin feeling hydrated and look smooth.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to try a bottle of Skin QR Organics NuElle Anti-cellulite Firming Concentrate for free through a promotion.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with that, as it takes 10 seconds to rub it on both legs simultaneously, and actually smells great.  </li>
            <li> Still smells clean and not too strong after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The application is easy and clean.</li>
            <li> If you are are struggling with advanced cellulite, go ahead and use the cream it will still work to your advantage.</li>
            <li> And I feel you should do more research and take more action on top of it.</li>
            <li> , my thigh looks toned and the skin is smooth and taut.</li>
            <li> This fantastic product contains a working combination of 25 well known flub busters to help in weight loss and reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> I even think it helped smooth out my stretch</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a cellulite cream that is gentle, no heat sensation and yet effective on my skin.</li>
            <li> : I also apply the lotions to my face and neck with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> : I also apply the lotions to my face and neck with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> All in all, celulite is not yet a primary nagging problem, but I like to be proactive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last year or so, and it&#x27;s delivered some great results.</li>
            <li> I got this product free via tomoson.com, but I WILL NOT let that affect the integrity of this review.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great product that actually performs as per the description.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and the bottle feels light already.</li>
            <li> That was great to hear from a critical bunch like them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I actually re-ordered it.</li>
            <li> Makes your legs feel smooth and not oily</li>
            <li> I feel as though this product is helping smooth things out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not have a scent.</li>
            <li> I give this a 4 because it does have a light fish odor combined with a ginger odor.  </li>
            <li> Product is packaged well ensuring it remains secure during the shipment.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience</li>
            <li> smell very nicely- smooth to apply .</li>
            <li> (I see it is now available again).</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> My butt, thighs and stomach are cellulite free</li>
            <li> As soon I got my free bottle</li>
            <li> I am using this primarily on my thighs an gluts</li>
            <li> However, I like its scent and makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for second time ,and all i have to say is i&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received the product free* to try and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*regardless of getting this product for free</li>
            <li> Pump dispenser is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got this free and it works.</li>
            <li> Only been using for about a wk now and have noticed firming a really great product</li>
            <li> It make my skin soft and elastic, smells good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is natural, it smells and feels good.</li>
            <li> It has nice, soothing, soft sent that helps me relax even more.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 3-4 cellulite creams/lotions/gels over the years and this is by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Treating cellulite is an ongoing process, meaning I&#x27;ll have to continue using something to keep the monster at bay, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found two new products that work so well for me and at pretty reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I use this on an empty stomach right before I work out, for some reason I fell that does the best for me, since I am already burning fat while working out, why not have it consecrate on the areas the cream is.</li>
            <li> It delivers the right amount with no waste, and is great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Love the pump - and that it dispenses the right amount.</li>
            <li> After working out and eating right to lose more weight in hopes of getting rid of them when that didn&#x27;t work I almost gave in to getting another costly cosmetic procedure to repair the damage...</li>
            <li> and it definitely has been a huge improvement!!!</li>
            <li> this is the first review I have ever written...and I am writing about it because it works!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Very intriguing.</li>
            <li> Pleasant forest-like fragrance, easy absorption and along with exercise, proper diet and water intake</li>
            <li> believe getting up and rubbing my torso vigorously as I apply the lotion would have its own steady effect; that light exercise raises the body temperature,</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try it out since I am a huge skeptic</li>
            <li> I did not do any special exercise or diet, I actually stopped going to the gym for some time and still saw great results.</li>
            <li> I have never felt more confident in a bikini and this will be my new necessity every summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile and have noticed a significant difference</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement though and feel like I&#x27;d get additional results if I was more consistent.</li>
            <li> my results will only get better and better!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working or not.</li>
            <li> received free full size product in order to review.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> had a bit of saggy skin on my arms which has tightened up significantly.</li>
            <li> I have, though, significantly upped my workouts</li>
            <li> Out of all the lotions I have used this one seems to work the best without spending a small fortune on lotions</li>
            <li> definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> As before, I continue to go to the gym, drink tons of water and eat healthy so everything has been consistent except the product used.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered the set with the scrub and massager.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo excited when I read all the reviews about how this worked for people who were athletic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I wasn&#x27;t sure it  that this would work as I have never tried this type of product before  </li>
            <li> Even my sister made a comment that my legs looks significantly smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I do work out 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy, so</li>
            <li> I am the first time buyer, will need more time to evaluate it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently for 3 months while continuing my exercise and healthy diet</li>
            <li> Update: in my original review, I wrote: ...</li>
            <li> On thing to note: I packed my first bottle in a checked bag, and when I got it out after the flight, the top had popped off the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with cellulite and this product is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I would have success with it!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this with the sewed scrub and massager balls.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is light and absorbs fairly quickly, the smell is a bit swampy but not the deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It has a light lemon fragrance that quickly faded away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable, clean, and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best anti-cellulite creams I&#x27;ve used - at a far lower price than the ones from the \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; counters at the big name stores.  </li>
            <li> lets keep it clean.</li>
            <li> love that this is a light cream, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li> plus the smell &amp; texture are far better than many competitors.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply just like lotion and its worth the buy</li>
            <li> I am working out and eating a fairly clean diet as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had to purchase a lot of this kind of product &amp; this one is the best .</li>
            <li> was given the opportunity to try Skin QR Organics, NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite for free in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li> I would love to put a positive review but ....</li>
            <li> So far love this product!</li>
            <li> The Nuelle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite treatment is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> In fact, I actually kind of liked the light and natural scent of this concentrate and it made my skin feel really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and leaves my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> The pump is easy to use and provides the right amount of product for me.</li>
            <li> what i really love though is that the product is very clean and all natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most consistent user and I should be because I love it so much, but I use it as often as I use any of my beloved &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products and this has definitely become one of them.  </li>
            <li> Though not 100 percent gone (and I don&#x27;t expect it to be right away), I do have to admit WHAT A DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> I have to start right off with it WORKS!</li>
            <li> buying right now - AGAIN!</li>
            <li> The first week I didn&#x27;t see any significant change but by the second week it was AMAIZING love love this product, it works wonders, my skin looks better and feels tighter as well.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the fact that it&#x27;s full of high quality organic ingredients as well!</li>
            <li> The NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It has a really refreshing smell that&#x27;s very spa-like</li>
            <li> Well, they&#x27;re full of you know what.  </li>
            <li> i noticed it does make me sweat more during intense activity.</li>
            <li> It really tightens up your skin and the smell is almost intoxicating - love it.  </li>
            <li> Good product and bought my second bottle so that I don&#x27;t run out before I get my replacement.</li>
            <li> I LOVED it and bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> to sure how much it helped with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, but it is sooo nice, and I know it is natural because of the brand.</li>
            <li> Now I am a true believer of Nuelle.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but none has given me the results as fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having never \\&quot;treated\\&quot; the area before, the results really popped at first, with me seeing a good deal of tightening within the first three months; the rest of my results happened gradually, sometimes in bursts</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about literally every product Ive used from these folks.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Currently, we’re testing the NuElle Anti Cellulite Concentrate to see how good of a job it does on the “flub”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different creams and really loved this one.</li>
            <li> and that is so true,</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will wait to see if good on cellulite, it has only been a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves your legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I would honestly recommend this product to anyone who is self conscious about their cellulite without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> So, my thought is that it has to be used on a regular basis to maintain good results.  </li>
            <li> It kept my skin soft and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> I started to use it 2-3 times a day making sure to run it in really well.</li>
            <li> Good quality, last a while</li>
            <li> Feels good actually using something with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> With so many on the market I really did my research</li>
            <li> I must say that I am a big skeptic when it comes to cellulite creams or any creams that promise results that are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it absorbs nicely and is not sticky like some other products.</li>
            <li> Loving this actually needing to buy some more because I&#x27;m running out of first</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and with all the good reviews I decided to go for it - WELL, it did absolutely NOTHING!!  </li>
            <li> At first the smell bothered me and now its fine and doesn&#x27;t even phase me.</li>
            <li> Does work better than anything else I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different creams, workouts</li>
            <li> I noticed results fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Both products went quickly though.  </li>
            <li> This item arrived quite quickly, and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> The deal breaker is that it didn&#x27;t do much for my actual cellulite, its a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> Now I am on my second and love it even more.</li>
            <li> Mild smell, not offensive.</li>
            <li> This is more noticeable on my upper arms, but it gets a lot better on the thighs too.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying more :)</li>
            <li> but that might be just because it doesn&#x27;t absorb quick at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome is the second bottle I ordered and for sure is working I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has been a blessing in disguise where my cellulite is concerned.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the benefits of this product and look forward to even greater results with it in the future.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how quick this works.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly I started to see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Skin QR Organics Anti Cellulite cream has a mild scent, but it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks the cream rather quickly</li>
            <li> I have a mild amount of cellulite/dimply skin around my thighs but work out 5-6 times a week.</li>
            <li> (it is not available in Europe, you guys have it good:) ).</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.  </li>
            <li> It does suggest not using it while pregnant I would suggest this for men who just like to reduce their cellulite.</li>
            <li> You can tell all the ingredients are high quality and I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I just resisted the temptation to write a review right away as I wanted to see if the magic continues, thanks to my skepticism.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how many fabulous ingredients and how it worked, You don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural and made with organic ingredients!!</li>
            <li> I started using it, I first noticed the scent which was pleasant and reminded me of wintergreen mixed with lemon grass.</li>
            <li> but in the first week I could see a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Triple Action - Does an excellent job compared to the product that is twice as much with same results.  </li>
            <li> Upon the first application I noticed how light the cream is.</li>
            <li> I found that the best way to use this, it was to apply every other day using the massager and wrapping my  legs and butt with the Clear Plastic wrap ( Yes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wasn&#x27;t very consistent with the use</li>
            <li> I saw some very interesting before and after of women who totally transformed their bodies.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and have placed a second order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went with another product not to long ago because of the reviews and though a boost would be good</li>
            <li> Tried several lotions, gels and creams without any results but can honestly say that NuElle Triple Action is effective in treating Cellulite.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product to help you break down some unwanted cellulite or help you aide in your weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:After contacting the suppliers concerning the cap problem, I received top service and a new product was sent to me asap.</li>
            <li> This product is better than a majority of the products I have tried, and I, like you, read the reviews before trying new products.  </li>
            <li> It is great that I have also noticed that previously I retained water and this has helped with water retention as well.</li>
            <li> it smelled great and had a light texture to it when I released a small amount to try.</li>
            <li> I has quite a strong smell, and I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> I also been taking pole-dancing fitness classes 3-4x/week (super fun BTW)</li>
            <li> I really like this product, not greasy, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very moisturized (like all day!!).</li>
            <li> amazing lotion is only the &amp;#34;icing&amp;#34; on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic too.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and I intend to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Triple Actions Anti Cellulite is the ONLY reason I am able to wear shorts this summer!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> And it really works!!</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;Phat QR Body and Cellulite Massager Waterproof&amp;#34; and the combination of all three has really improved the appearance of cellulite on my legs!!</li>
            <li> I have just purchased my second bottle and look forward to seeing even more results!</li>
            <li> Pleased so far!</li>
            <li> On top of that, right after the first bottle have finished, I already saw a large difference.</li>
            <li> This is a light cream texture, easy to apply, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I do however, recommend that when you rub this in, be prepared to wait a good 5-10 minutes if your schedule allows for your skin to air dry to help the &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation to go a way quicker, than if you were to trap it in your clothing right after rubbing this product into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle because I&#x27;ve witnessed amazing results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have been using if for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about this product is that when i put it on it makes my skin really smooth, theres no reason to dislike this it.</li>
            <li> gives amazing soft skin, i really enjoy!not</li>
            <li> I have tried many things, but recently I found this product and liked the organic and natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Amazing results within a short time period.</li>
            <li> The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s really helped smooth out my thighs and bum.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to change their skin into silk and have it be smooth.</li>
            <li> like the way it feels and the fast absorption into the skin, and it also has a light fragrance too.</li>
            <li> it smells fresh</li>
            <li> I receive products complimentary to review, all opinions are 100% mine and after use of product</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and almost cellulite free.  </li>
            <li> and it’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and i am rubbing it in morning before my waist trainer and evening after i take my waist trainer off, no crazy results yet</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> It does create a warming sensation, which lets you know the product is indeed working, but I feel I need to use it more frequently, before I notice the results I am hoping for.</li>
            <li> you but fewer lumps and bumps which alone was worth it there.</li>
            <li> Smells great  and left skin soft but didn&#x27;t notice any change in appearance</li>
            <li> The cost is WELL worth the response you will get</li>
            <li> I prefer more of an open top so that you can scrape the insides of the bottle to get every last bit of product vs. a pump design with a top that can&#x27;t easity be removed.</li>
            <li> (I am not just writing a favorable review for the chance of free product), and will order more in the future.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product not knowing of what kind of results to expect.</li>
            <li> The product itself just seems so healthy, organic and natural.</li>
            <li> As is a problem for many fit males, I had deep smile parentheses that have all but vanished by now, leaving a far more rested and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> As is a problem for many fit males, I had deep smile parentheses that have all but vanished by now, leaving a far more rested and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> So, absolutely worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> So, again, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say and agree that this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I love that its natural</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> This one is so different and effective</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> This 5oz bottle of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate was used as my lotion day and night to make sure I can receive maximum results.</li>
            <li> so I would say it is safe for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the product&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I liked it, and already ordered my second one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in firmness and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use the product and now that I have been using it for a good amount of time I have definitely been able to see and feel the changes, and I can definitely vouch for this miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any woman who is looking after her figure in a more natural way.</li>
            <li> The seller is awesome, I&#x27;ve received all my orders on time or earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I am not big fan of the smell but for smooth skin I will do anything:)</li>
            <li> Just by looking at the ingredients, there are so many great oils that are ofcourse amazing for your skin, such as: Aloe, Sunflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Geranium essential Oil, Rosehip Oil, Evening Primrose Oil.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other oils and ingredients that were interesting because I have never really noticed them in lotions.</li>
            <li> Pump bottle is high quality, easy to disoense.&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> After having tried many other anti-cellulite lotions on the market, I can say  unequivocally that this anti-cellulite concentrate has the most popular anti-cellulite ingredients in a natural formulation that works very well at reducing the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Works far better than anything else I have tried and at a good price compared to the other products out there.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about 3 months ago and unlike all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this definitely reduced the appearance of my cellulite (plus it&#x27;s organic and smells awesome too!).  </li>
            <li> i go through them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product, but it is natural without perfume, which is more important to me.</li>
            <li> even completely finishing the first bottle I ordered a second one and I will continue using this product since I am absolutely happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I do think it will take more than a few weeks for the Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to be able to take full effect.  </li>
            <li> The smell is surprisingly pleasant and the lotion feels like any other lotion (no weird tingling).</li>
            <li> use it right after we get out of the shower and rub it in.</li>
            <li> If it is burning in any way wash right off.</li>
            <li> My loyalty stays right here.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT look at my right side</li>
            <li> I also work out about five times a week, and I like to put this cream on right before I work out.</li>
            <li> and you get the right amount every time.  </li>
            <li> The product also is greasy, so if you are going to put on some clothes right away</li>
            <li> Info work out and eat right</li>
            <li> I am very pleased, as cellulite can be very stubborn, and I will likely recommend this product to any woman with cellulite.</li>
            <li> The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother just in time for my first cruise to the Bahamas.  </li>
            <li> Out of all others I tried in the past year, this one so far is the best.</li>
            <li> After all I am aware that it will take more than a month or two to see any considerable change.</li>
            <li> I TRIED MANY MANY MANY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, BEING NAME BRAND HIGH END PRODUCTS (CLARINS), AND</li>
            <li> &#x27;s, first start out by a funny story though about me testing this out!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan and would highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Remember that cellulite is a strong enemy and usually no one thing can beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did, as the new choices work much</li>
            <li> I have previously used Cellutherm (8oz) which worked well, but last time I tried to order, my security system said &amp;#34; dodgy website.&amp;#34;  This is an excellent alternative &amp; I trust Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was not looking for miracle, a small difference would of been great, but I got no change at all.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle and just a small quarter size amount does the trick.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I recommend you pay a higher price for this product because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not so good but seems to die down after it dries up.</li>
            <li> I was delighted when I opened my package to see that they had sent me some samples of their other products!</li>
            <li> I will not say that your cellulite will disappear overnight, but with consistent use and a little time, the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> I still want to see more improvement but husband saw a notable difference in as little as 3 wks time, using once a day (with a massager).</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product after trying other products in the past and not having any visible help with reducing cellulite, I am happy to say that this product does work.</li>
            <li> The best part is that this product is very competitively priced compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> I am certainly going to continue and find out!</li>
            <li> The product appeared to tighten skin and was easy to dispense with the pump action dispenser bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more soft and much smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite for my entire life, even when I am in great shape, and this is the only product that has worked.</li>
            <li> Yes, I claim 100% responsibility for my lack of self-control, but I am oh-so happy to find a product that actually gives my skin back some of its lost youthfulness.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> a slight tingle--which is good....</li>
            <li> The texture is great, smell is minimal, and leaves your skin feeling so soft that you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell is surprising but quite fresh and green.</li>
            <li> This is the best firming lotion I have ever used, and I have used numerous others, including Clarins and Heavy Duty (by Jocott) brands.  </li>
            <li> the company is easy to deal with, communicates well and offers very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Other than that I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> the formula is non-greasy and soaks into the skin really well with no unpleasant scent or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is organic and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> I like this one very much</li>
            <li> I think the price value of this product is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in 2 different spots and I am Loving the results, that I may try a few more spots!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong for me personally, but once applied the cream absorbs quickly, and the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> use consistently enough to determine results but high quality ingredients packaged nicely that will keep ingredients stable</li>
            <li> I even think I was only applying it once a day on week one, which might be why it took a while to work but do it twice a day and stick to it even if it looks like it&#x27;s not working because my cellulite is hereditary and I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it since puberty hit more years ago than I care to say</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> can/bottle, I&#x27;m breastfeeding, eating healthy,  waisting training and exercising and with this as extra help</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update i purchased more since last year</li>
            <li> This is just my second time using it, but I am 100% sure that I will continue using it over and over again.</li>
            <li> and I have seen results the first week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much it costs - I will pay for it because it WORKS!</li>
            <li> and I would only buy again if I for sure followed the recommended use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since April &amp; will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Works great, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I did within the FIRST night.</li>
            <li> Thank you I for one will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> First off – I’m not a blogger</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Also the fact that it has all natural products is important to me too.</li>
            <li> I just finished using  my first bottle</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper to do it at home!</li>
            <li> So this is a real gem!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, I researched a lot before I bought it, the ingredient list was exactly what I was looking for and being mostly organic  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> product when I first opened</li>
            <li> The key is also to continue a healthy fitness routine as well as staying hydrated to receive a maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> I have used many different creams over the years to help with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> In the two weeks, I saw more cellulite come back.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, products as described, hope this works!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I never go to the beach without first putting this product on.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first bottle of this</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered, and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
            <li> This product in my eyes is well worth the money and the time to really try this out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally remove it, but for me I think my stomach looks 50% better in the sun.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this and totally love it.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li> I work out avidly and just wanted something to help with the dimples in some problem areas.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> but you need to do a lot of squats, butt exercises, exercise overall and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much silkier and smoother as well!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to try longer.</li>
            <li> , I had already noticed the skin on my stomach looking so much smoother!</li>
            <li> Okay so I just started my second bottle of the Nuelle cellulite cream and on my 4th week of using it</li>
            <li> so much I am going to try another item from Skin QR Organics!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and soft without leaving it sticky.</li>
            <li> I literally cannot believe how much this reduces the appearance of cellulite!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially ready for vacation!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results, it not only helped but my legs look better than before I had my injury.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it daily over a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion in combination with the scrub and massager of the same brand and was able to see results within a week of using them (applying every night after a shower).</li>
            <li> cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out.</li>
            <li> cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out.</li>
            <li> Much Peace!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this NuElle</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for the first time</li>
            <li> I am almost at the end of my first bottle and repurchasing another now.</li>
            <li> This cream delivers exactly what it promises, it firms your skin and reduces the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft, supple, and smooth.</li>
            <li> to prevent it from plaguing me too much!</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li> Cellulite isn’t a pretty thing, my friends.</li>
            <li> I changed this from a 3 star to a one star because the company contacted me, trying to bully me into giving them a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I am seeing my middle, love handles and stomach a bit</li>
            <li> is my first bottle</li>
            <li> so I will give myself more time after the second bottle where the thighs are concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am also seeing more results on my middle and thighs</li>
            <li> I am now on my 2nd bottle, and hope to see more improvement as I go.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> My girlfriends who haven&#x27;t seen me for a while noticed it first.</li>
            <li> Love the scrub, body creme, and facial foaming</li>
            <li> overall look is better.</li>
            <li> I like this product and most likely reorder again.</li>
            <li> and if you use it without overdoing it, this product will last you a while. :)</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients reads like a who&#x27;s who of the top essential oils and herbs used to combat cellulite.</li>
            <li> This lotion made me ready for vacation in Miami Beach!</li>
            <li> I recommend when you first use this products,put it on 2 x times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking with continued use things can only get better.  </li>
            <li> After using the first order I switched to another brand</li>
            <li> I do also exercise daily, drink lots of water, and eat healthy about 50% of the time.</li>
            <li> and it does moisturize pretty well.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING NUELLE TRIPLE ANTI CELLULITE LOTION FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH NUELLE!</li>
            <li> I really feel that when I rub it into my in a circular motion....that it is really absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> But this product starts to show results within a couple of weeks, You have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day.</li>
            <li> But with this cream I started to see results in the first week.</li>
            <li> The product lasted exactly three weeks using it twice a day as directed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To rid of cellulite you must eat healthy, add some cardio daily and do lots and lots of squats!!</li>
            <li> and I work out consistently.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what it has done for my thighs.</li>
            <li> I bought first one and saw effect in couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> However, fairly consistent use of this anti cellulite cream has truly and noticeably tightened and smoothed the skin in these areas to where I would even consider wearing a bathing suit this summer,</li>
            <li> I ordered two more bottles, and I&#x27;m just starting the first of those.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> or so I saw real smoothing results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s second purpose, is the scent, I love it.</li>
            <li> packaging is great with the negative air pump.</li>
            <li> I normally use 1 full pump for each of my thighs, which is where i needed to focus on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no miracle where cellulite is concerned, it takes regular massaging and the appropriate product for one&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that I will see more results on my upper thighs before summer.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I am ordering my second bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It seemed as if I could see a difference within the first week ( the Finulite could have contributed to that).</li>
            <li> I bought an entire set a couple of months ago and replenishing for sure now.</li>
            <li> higher end $60</li>
            <li> saw many complaints about the pump of the bottle, but I personally had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> You must be consistent though to see results.</li>
            <li> This was the first anti-cellulite cream that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I had an issue with the product when i first got it</li>
            <li> The first smell I smelled when I put it on was aloe.</li>
            <li> One of the first ingredients is water and then aloe juices.</li>
            <li> After the first week, you start noticing the difference.</li>
            <li> I see results for sure, and the product arrived 8 days prior to estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> lotion twice a day everyday plus exercise and good eating habits, has been a miracle to me.</li>
            <li> Worth it by far!!!</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate really works!!!</li>
            <li> So far this product has worked better that any other cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried, an I&#x27;ve tried many others.</li>
            <li> The amount of the cream should be more due to multiple times use to be effective.</li>
            <li> First of all, as other reviewers have mentioned, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This cream has a very faint fragrance, it&#x27;s a very light beautiful smell.  </li>
            <li> Smells like old limes but is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Within first week it makes your skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and happy so far.</li>
            <li> its easy to use and goes far beyond what others do to not only fight flab but make the skin you apply it to look smooth and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have re-ordered numerous times from this same company (quick shipping and nicely packaged).</li>
            <li> If you purchase this product, I would say give it some time with daily use and you&#x27;ll definitely see some good results.  </li>
            <li> Nice tightening action after only 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> …I&#x27;m a real brat about them because I just simply don&#x27;t like most--I love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought that because of the price it was going to be much stronger than the Nivea Cellulite serum (which actually works better)</li>
            <li> A good choice compared to so many products that say they do the trick although fail at it every time.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty decent and it does tighten the skin well!</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a positive difference in terms of water retention and circulation.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I chose to try this one based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Best on the market, like the other reviewer wrote - hands down!</li>
            <li> soooo pretty much</li>
            <li> The cellulite is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that minor issue, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing the lotion for the summer :)</li>
            <li> So, I guess I was too eager to get started, and didn&#x27;t read the directions very well at first.</li>
            <li> Give it time, patience and perseverance, I have noticed the first real results after around 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s all natural and is chalked full of ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I lost my muscle and developed what looked like a bag full of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I feel that I can see improvement on the cellulite on my legs and it is thick and creamy with a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of this products as other body lotions to cover an entire area, making it a really great value.</li>
            <li> I do some dry brushing before hand to make sure it penetrates well.</li>
            <li> I like to put a thicker layer, let it dry and then put on cotton leggings for better results.</li>
            <li> To get rid of cellulite is not that easy as it seems, it needs discipline, regular exercises and a quality skincare.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and is not artificially scented but smells so pretty.</li>
            <li> Usually they would SPREAD ALL OVER  the place, but now they look more fit and trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have been using this product over 10 months and only after three months of use I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my upper arms, which now seems more tone and less crinkly.</li>
            <li> I have used NuElle products for the last six months, and I have already recommended this product to my family and friends and would strongly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After being using this product for over a month I can certainly say I&#x27;ve seen the results.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly large amt.</li>
            <li> I did not have much hope to start with but after reading all these positive reviews I decided to try the product.</li>
            <li> Not usually writing reviews, but this product is worth all the bragging and effort to write it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to tell a huge difference after using this product, feels nice on my skin but has a very weird smell.</li>
            <li> you can pretty much FEEL the cream for at least a good couple hours after...</li>
            <li> The only problem is that you really need to put a lot on because it soaks in so easily.  </li>
            <li> Me and my husband were so delightful to notice a little result already the next day after only one time of using .</li>
            <li> It has a dual feature, for 1 it really works; keeps the skin tight and really does play a preventive role on top of eating right and exercise when it comes to fighting cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference on the back of my thighs after just a couple weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> it really works as I just bought this.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works, in fast period of time.</li>
            <li> My cellulite has definitely diminished and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> But cellulite is something that always wants to be at the party.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I have used up the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I continue to use this post shower, and really like the moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li> Firms up the skin and works very well.</li>
            <li> My cellulite on my thighs has improved better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference; however it does state</li>
            <li> I had to pinch myself to see if really worked.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast as well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much difference.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite my whole life.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very grateful.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everybody!</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel very moist and supple.</li>
            <li> But NuElle  really works I have noticed a difference in my cellulite</li>
            <li> real results</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I was very surprise with the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of this cream is very soothing, almost like a lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li> I think I really like it.</li>
            <li> this product along with sensible nutrition and exercising REALLY helps to detox  and diminish cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of cellulite since I was a teenager without much luck.  </li>
            <li> It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I used it as directed until the whole bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> but cellulite is still very visible.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  </li>
            <li> you have to be diligent and really massage it in.  </li>
            <li> i think that really helps too.  </li>
            <li> and I am really seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I do not exercise much</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> I saw noticeable results after a few weeks and when I run out I&#x27;ll most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have cellulite</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I have read so much on these creams</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of any difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> But you have to put time into doing the whole process.</li>
            <li> My belly also seems much firmer.</li>
            <li> And I have seen that his really does work, we have since always been going to the gym but the cellulite was still there on her hamstrings.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I use it on my upper legs to tighten and smooth them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product came fast even though is not prime.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> but after a month, I absolutely did see a difference there, too.</li>
            <li> but this product really helps.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> over whelming at times.. really don&#x27;t see an improvement at all</li>
            <li> It really does diminish the appearance of cellulite, results can be seen after about 3 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a couple years and can really tell a difference when I am using it.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to get rid of it and try to find the ways to do so.</li>
            <li> I really want that all beauty products were the quality of Skin QR Organics.</li>
            <li> This came so fast</li>
            <li> and I really want to get the body wash</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks with a combination of light cardio</li>
            <li> Much Peace!hin</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for cellulite - this stuff works - and very well.</li>
            <li> ABOUT 30%.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING, BUT</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite to begin with, but I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my stretch marks have started fading.</li>
            <li> I think the combination of the 2 are what has really started making the difference.  </li>
            <li> That’s the whole process!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> You sweat a bit with it on at night but that tells you it is really working.</li>
            <li> This product feels very greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can put up with it....</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a loss of about 1/4 inch on each arm and about that much on the thighs and butt.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use, but like any product that gives you visual results whether instant, or progressive results consistency is the key.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot)</li>
            <li> Looks promising to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do much exercises</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting help with this thanks to this NuElle Cellulite product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer pump dispenser and the NuElle is very sleek</li>
            <li> I will need to check into those to enhance my already promising results.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for temporary tightening of my thighs after a shower.</li>
            <li> it blends really well.</li>
            <li> what really sets this product apart.</li>
            <li> Really hoped for some visible change ...</li>
            <li> this really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also find the scent very spa-like</li>
            <li> and I really look forward to applying after my bath.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I can use some help, to be ready for the beach.</li>
            <li> It really tightens the areas where you apply it</li>
            <li> Nothing I have done has ever helped and I really didn&#x27;t believe in products claiming to do what this product claims it does.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference with this</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much cellulite.</li>
            <li> I had always used Clarins,but since using Nuelle I am much happier with the results.</li>
            <li> that’s how much of a difference I have experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does look better but not really the desire effects for the cost.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li> Really you can see results.</li>
            <li> but one must remember you really cannot get rid of Cellulite with a cream  </li>
            <li> and I was really</li>
            <li> , I got up in the morning and decided to look at the ingredients more carefully</li>
            <li> I am not seeing drastic difference, but don&#x27;t have much of a problem, but I am continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference with the appearance of my cellulite on butt and thighs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  really  care for the scrub?</li>
            <li> Results might vary based on size and skin type, so if you really want to know how it works you really need to try it for yourself to find</li>
            <li> works really well on the skin of my arms.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite</li>
            <li> this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, the product feels light yet firming up my skin.</li>
            <li> I really didnt think I had a chance.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much expectations after trying others, but there is hope in cellulite department when it comes to this one.</li>
            <li> It ships really fast and well</li>
            <li> and I am like really for that price and that much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend! &#x27;</li>
            <li> I tried this product and so far I liked the results, is not a miracle but slowly is helping a lot to smooth my skin and to minimize my cellulite.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly bad, but it is noticeable in the sun light and whenever I bend down.</li>
            <li> I have clearly seen a difference in my skin!!!  </li>
            <li> I didn’t have cellulite on my stomach, but I can tell my stomach and love handles are less bloated – this lotion really draws out water from your body because of the caffeine in it!</li>
            <li> My order came quickly the first time, a bit longer the second time</li>
            <li> I run out of my first bottle and ordered a new one that was delivered on Friday.</li>
            <li> Also a little bit goes a long way because it goes on so smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> not sure how much of it is the lotion, but definitely  want to try it some more to see more results</li>
            <li> I got the first bottle as a trial from a friend, loved it so much that I bought a second; saw a smoother appearance in just a few days.</li>
            <li> This has a light cream texture, it is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, it is also fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I think it takes a strict daily regimen to see a significant result.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love that sometimes they send samples of their other products that I now buy and love!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream based on other reviews andimI&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, there is not enough significant difference for me to reorder this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my next step:) don&#x27;t be lazy, join me:)</li>
            <li> It works way better than other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it can feel tacky against form fitting clothes, like boxer-briefs, or the underarms until it absorbs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a tall bottle that blends in well on my bathroom counter top with my other products</li>
            <li> Love this, other than the scent 4 stars because of the scent.</li>
            <li> Skin QR Organics recommends using 2 of their other products with this Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate, after reading how the products work together it makes sense that the results will be even greater using the scrub and massager.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has a unique chemical make up and there may be some people who respond differently</li>
            <li> I am pleased with that, since I have not seen any results at all with other cheaper products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds but this one works!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is reasonable and I was surprised at how long the bottle lasted.</li>
            <li> I exercise every day and I am sure that helps too, but I have always been active and no other product left me as satisfied as this one.</li>
            <li> I have seen very minimal changes along my thigh area and these changes are for the better.</li>
            <li> one drawback i have to mention is that you do have to use it everyday for best results, and the bottles are rather small for the price.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with an active lifestyle and healthy eating choices, I SEE a visible difference.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I always want to put in my body, face and hair natural staff, so why not Natural and Helping to Reduce Cellulite? :)))</li>
            <li> I think the skin is more responsive after a bath or shower to the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> After my first bottle of this cream, I felt it was actually working and decided it was worth trying another bottle.  </li>
            <li> Finally something that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave any type of rash or dryness, it&#x27;s all natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Argania sent me a 5oz complimentary NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate product to test out and review, and I have been pleasantly surprised at my results!</li>
            <li> im pretty excited about that, especially since im a lot smaller than what i was before when first buying this product.</li>
            <li> Then I take 3 full pumps of this NuElle cream and 2 pumps of Nivea Gel and mix it in my hands and apply it all over my thighs, buttocks and any left over</li>
            <li> The skin definitely looks more smooth, firm and elastic.</li>
            <li> It is pretty natural for women to have cellulite</li>
            <li> It should be used twice a day what was the most was challenging, apply on thighs, buttocks and stomach every day, no matter if you are tired or busy.</li>
            <li> It may take a while longer to see its full potential but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;willing to stick it out for a while.</li>
            <li> it leaves a tiny bit of a residue but not bad.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product, I consider myself very fit, but I still have some cellulite on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> Thighs are slimming down a lil more and the cellulite appearance are reduced some and skin does feel firmer.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjuction with the New!</li>
            <li> Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  </li>
            <li> Regrettably, this is not a MIRACLE product and so far, after my first bottle, has not completely rid me of my unsightly cellulite (hence, the 4 stars), however; it does significantly improve the appearance, and for this I will re-purchase.  </li>
            <li> It appears to me the less fat and cellulite for the area being treated the faster this product works and the greater the cellulite is minimized.  </li>
            <li> My legs have less dimples and appear more toned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The areas we use it are: upper legs, upper arms, glute area, love handle, and stomach.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only works, it works quickly.</li>
            <li> Use only as directed and it is not recommended if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would say, is I would love it if the company offered a larger size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review early so I can get a free bottle, will update once I&#x27;m done with 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> I see the most difference in the back of my thighs, under upper arms and neck and chin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and this is the only one that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> No results after few good everything is the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products, all with the same results --- nothing!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend NuElle to anyone looking for a cellulite reducing cream that works quickly.</li>
            <li> Most products haven&#x27;t worked in the past but this one does REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried NUMEROUS similar products over the years and have never been satisfied until NuElle.</li>
            <li> It helps if used daily after skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is quick and the product comes wrapped well in bubble wrap</li>
            <li> As i get older and my body isnt how it use to  be , i started looking for a product to help tighten up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smell and hasn&#x27;t left a sticky residue after application.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that I am buying twice, and I am definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> being organic is a plus, I am not much on chemicals, It is a pleasure knowing what I am putting on my skin is natural ingrediants made by God, and put into a lotion :)</li>
            <li> Nuelle provides lots of moisturizing, instantly makes my skin look more plump while ongoing use has definitely reduced my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I recently became proactive because I wanted to start focusing on being and looking healthy ( not getting any younger).</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing, makes my skin soft and firm</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again; I love this stuff, it actually works.</li>
            <li> a final piece of advice, don&#x27;t place all your eggs in the same basket :).</li>
            <li> must say, I was very surprised by my results!</li>
            <li> I have been trying out several cellulite creams, being very aware that NO cellulite cream can cure this unsightly condition.</li>
            <li> Highly</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream given the reviews I read on here</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the vendor too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> However, I am used to high tingle tanning products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying NuElle.</li>
            <li> I am very toned and healthy &amp; the back of my thighs are the only area I have been self conscious about.</li>
            <li> This is really amazing, especially because I&#x27;ve tried a number of other creams with no noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine what will happen after a couple of other bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> &quot; Answer: worse than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li> Right away I could notice how smooth and firm my skin was getting, and after a month of use I can definitely say that this product is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one with really noticeable results; however, I have also been training for my first half marathon, so that may be having an effect as well.  </li>
            <li> Works a little better than working out without it.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m thinking that for someone like me I might need a little more time or work to get the results that I would like to get from this cream.</li>
            <li> While I did see some minor improvement with other products, this one is superior by far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was getting a huge result from this product because I wasn&#x27;t serving dramatic results and was eexercising more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on her very liberally, twice a day, but since other reviewers are using it 1x daily and getting good results, I will cut back.  </li>
            <li> It does help firm up the skin which in turn helps with a more active lifestyle and being more conscious of what I eat.  </li>
            <li> It does smooth and firm up the skin nicely and gives a little confidence boost when headed out in bathing suite.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other anti cellulite creams that don&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> It blends in fast and rubs in to a clear gel like cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is all natural and organic and contains 25 cellulite fighting ingredients, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not experience any greasy residue with this product and after showering just applied it as a mere moisturizing agent and its worked great.</li>
            <li> have not quite used the product long enough to know if it works or not, but i do love the smell, texture, absorbability &amp; natual ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got very itchy and red bumps after first use that continued for days...</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products and a lot of money thrown out of the window, I finally found this product that I absolutely love so far (and it is not to pricey either).</li>
            <li> I did notice firmer skin after a few days, but better results will hopefully be shown after weeks of continuous usage.</li>
            <li> not sure if it really reduced cellulite, but you can feel how smooth the skin is!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product even if you dont have problem with cellulite, makes skin so firm:-)</li>
            <li> I rarely, if ever, eat fried foods, but struggle with my weakness which is definitely sweets.  </li>
            <li> in my opinion if its working its worth it though so will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try, I wish they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> I only recommend products I think are worth sharing.</li>
            <li> If you always apply a cream nightly just place this where you would normally use your routine product.</li>
            <li> As for cellulite results, I will have to wait for a few weeks to be able to pronounce my verdict.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any burning, though it&#x27;s kind of thick and almost sticky after putting it on</li>
            <li> This cream is kind of thick</li>
            <li> The cream is nice and thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Use as little because its concentrated and it works great to my skin and less my weight, although i am not overweight</li>
            <li> nivea gel works MUCH MUCH better and costs much less so learn from me and save your money!</li>
            <li> After using this lotion, within 4 weeks, the back of my thighs were much more smooth, very little dimpling, and only visible in certain lighting.</li>
            <li> Well I was totally floored by the amazing results I received from just using this product in less than 2 weeks along with using the body blaster scrub and massager.</li>
            <li> I have seen a slight improvement in cellulite so far, and hope to see more.</li>
            <li> it is super well protected so you can be sure you won&#x27;t be receiving a broken bottle.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing, has worked as effectively as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It also makes your skin feel warm which I take to mean that there is some sweating going on, which could lead to a decrease in leg circumference.  </li>
            <li> NuElle was the next product I used and right away</li>
            <li> Buy it right now, I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I also have to start right off with I only did one ARM</li>
            <li> You should also wash your hands right away because they will feel gross.</li>
            <li> Also have been putting it on my double chin, couldn&#x27;t hurt right?</li>
            <li> This cellulite concentrate is rather different from others in a positive way!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth trying I&#x27;m excited to see the difference after using it for a few months!</li>
            <li> That being said, it does seem that the ingredients in some firming lotions, including this one, do promote a firming of loose skin and accelerate subcutaneous fat loss more so than a standard moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li> Overall, I think NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate brings pretty much all the results it claims.</li>
            <li> but now it looks smooth and matches my other leg.</li>
            <li> My first bottle malfunction,  right away seller answer my email and in two days I received the other bottle.</li>
            <li> improve alot new results every week&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really feel it helps smooth and firm my legs and also seems to draw out some of the water weight.</li>
            <li> , it goes on light and absorbs quickly as long as I dry myself off well first.</li>
            <li> came today, the 10th, earlier than expected, so I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if this products actually works, it smells so much like a lemon scented cleaner (which I really don&#x27;t care for) that I won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed improvement in approximately two weeks and am happy to say that I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> and I have tried and spent alot of money on many different products throughout the years.</li>
            <li> My problem area was mainly on one leg (thigh area) where I could clearly see the cellulite dimples under my skin</li>
            <li> I cannot really tell that it has really removed my cellulite, but I think combined with workout and proper food it will work well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle top can fall off and get this cream everywhere, so you have to be careful not to drop the bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell or the sticky feeling left on my skin which stayed that way even by the next morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference as far as cellulite.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will help you out with your confidence this product can definitely help at a decent price!!</li>
            <li> Rather than that, it makes it feel moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin very soft also.</li>
            <li> Your skins feels tacky for awhile until the lotion fully absorbs, then your skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft, so the crepy look is now gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and my cellulite are somewhat diminishing, however I have plenty of cellulite</li>
            <li> I eat clean, exercise and am not large but have always had issues with cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li> it was a little less expensive, but let&#x27;s face it the best products cost more.</li>
            <li> Within the first three days of using, I starting noticing my skin was firmer.</li>
            <li> First off let me say im one big skeptic for anything like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products but none come this close where I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference, but mostly reordered it because I noticed a difference when I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> The cellulite in my upper arms have significantly diminished and the measurement around the upper arm area has shrank about 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this is the only anti-cellulite cream that really works!</li>
            <li> When my daughter was home for spring break last week, I was wearing shorts and it was the first thing she noticed -</li>
            <li> Like most cellulite creams, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I have now noticed a bigger improvement since I first reviewed the set.</li>
            <li> and it is such a hot topic among women.</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate contains a cocktail of 25 well known flub busters that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction!</li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s extreme \\&quot;silkiness\\&quot; is better tolerated with female&#x27;s skin than males.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take long to see results too…and I must say that it is worth checking out and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 so far!</li>
            <li> As for my contribution, I eat lots of fruits and vegetables, drink mostly water, coffee in the morning and an occasional glass of white or red wine at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now with consistent and noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle and have ordered a second.</li>
            <li> I bought similar products in Europe and was excited to see this on the American market.</li>
            <li> I am going to stay with this now, but you have to be aware that no cream will take away your cellulite totally</li>
            <li> The first time i used it,i was surprise by the lasting diuretic effect</li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin feeling soft!  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin is so soft from this product!</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still there, but I am confident that with the continued use of this product I&#x27;ll  be able to wear me some short shorts this summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty big girl</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Like many other women out there, I have tried every product you can possibly imagine for cellulite treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Still, the seller gave me full refund minus shipping.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using it and highly recommend anybody who wants to get rid of cellulite to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> states that it firms, tightens, detoxifies skin inside and out, reduces water retention, improves circulation and the look and feel of your skin, which are all common needs for the average person and this is great if it does all</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply, within a few weeks I saw a drastic difference.</li>
            <li> There is a controlled pumped for the amount of the product released, and that is nice so that you don&#x27;t overuse the product (believe me a little goes a long way!).</li>
            <li> I only use organic and natural oils and creams on my skin/face/body, and that is what first attracted me to this cream.</li>
            <li> Nuelle Triple Action Concentrate actually does work, I have been  surprised and the price is so much better than&lt;br /&gt;the other product.  </li>
            <li> The price is right for this considering that it goes a long way and shows results!</li>
            <li> Less expensive than some others that call themselves ‘best’</li>
            <li> actually are looking more toned and way, way less dimples than when I started</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with clear instructions and I noticed results within a few days.  </li>
            <li> It kind of just sits on the skin making it very hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> My tip is to place it in the shower so when you are done and dry off you can apply it right in the shower.</li>
            <li> I work out consistently and eat right and have actually started working out even harder and still no difference.</li>
            <li> but I have opted to use it solely on certain areas such as my thighs, butt and stomach.</li>
            <li> The thights feel different, more tight</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in the areas with little dimples.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, non-greasy, soaks into the skin but not too quickly to enjoy a little massage.</li>
            <li> So, thank you to the attentive seller for the correct information, and for a little lesson in engineering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using cocoa butter and nivea ultra concentrated serum before this and was starting to see some noticeable results so decided to spend a little more and buy this.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick and a little sticky but absorbs great.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it has only been a little more than a week, so</li>
            <li> For 100% results it will take100% of hard work and dedication, not just a magic cream.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my stomach and thighs and within a week I can see a huge difference in the tone and cellulite .  </li>
            <li> You are not gonna waste anything, a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a HUGE improvement in the tone/texture of my thighs and waste line.  </li>
            <li> I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  </li>
            <li> I have been using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate as part of my daily routine to get in beach ready shape.</li>
            <li> So far I have used 3 bottles, and after the second one, I really started noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> So far I like this</li>
            <li> Using this will keep that person you don&#x27;t want at the party busy on someone else&#x27;s thighs, butt, arms and gut.</li>
            <li> The cream also makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Although no product will completely take away cellulite, I can see it helps in the reduction in appearance.</li>
            <li> Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li> my skin felt amazingly soft...</li>
            <li> I have been using #NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Firming Concentrate with 25 flub busters for 2 weeks now,  in place of my nightly lotion.</li>
            <li> So far this is working for me.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks there has been no change as far as cellulite but my skin tone has Improved some.</li>
            <li> it takes several weeks, so I did purchase another bottle to really give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thin, work out 6 days a week, drink a butt ton of water, &amp; generally eat pretty healthy</li>
            <li> This is so far my fav creme &amp; i have been experimenting for years.</li>
            <li> which I was really surprised about.  </li>
            <li> Since using this, my skin feels softer and smoother, but I can&#x27;t say the dimples are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream&lt;</li>
            <li> I rub it in until it completely dissappears into my skin.</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 years old</li>
            <li> It does smooth and firm up my arms and never want to be without it again.</li>
            <li> However, I am still a woman, 38 years old, and have had a baby.</li>
            <li> They ship extremely fast and its shipped proper.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed my legs are firmer</li>
            <li> I am very slim, but there is cellulite dimples on my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this product based on the reviews but the &amp;#34;odd smell&amp;#34; lingers with you for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> leaves your skin silky soft and does help diminish cellulite and tighten the skin on my thighs if used every day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife, she is using it everyday, and i have seen the results, her skin looks thighter and looks smooth..</li>
            <li> I have been using the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for over a month.</li>
            <li> I use it religiously two times a day For two weeks straight.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin ridiculously soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have used the concentrate for several months now and i can really tell a difference when i go without applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I  am 40 years old and about 20 lbs.</li>
            <li> The one perk that I did like about this was it made me feel soft for an extended period of time-</li>
            <li> BTW, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and weigh 112 lbs - have had cellulite since my late teens and workout 5x/week, eat a healthy diet but still cannot get rid of the cellulite.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so much that can be done against the forces of time</li>
            <li> Oh also my skin has never felt so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> You should definitely try both if you can because the skin feels really refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother and nore soft.</li>
            <li> That time I did not pay much attention to it, but years passed, a baby appeared in our family and all those cellulite spots became obvious.</li>
            <li> , I like how my skin becomes firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> To my delight, the combo really helped and I saw encouraging results in a relatively short time (three weeks).</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my 3d product that really gave me that look and confidence after 15yrs to wear shorts again.  </li>
            <li> Triple Action Anti celluite concentrate</li>
            <li> I try to exercise at least 3 times a week and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is almost gone, and I am over 30 years old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a ton of natural ingredients, like caffeine, flower extracts, herbs and vitamins.</li>
            <li> Before I came across with NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate, I used Clarins products, the oil and the cream.  </li>
            <li> I am a fit person with a few stubborn areas of cellulite, so I had hoped this product would help me out.  </li>
            <li> It even stays soft after showering again.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff has won by far.</li>
            <li> Plus it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thighs felt like a silk and skin became smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> It was like it had not dried.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products with ingredients from nature which has not been tampered with.</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate creates a sauna effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me: I&#x27;m a 25 year old male(guys get cellulite too)</li>
            <li> I started noticing cellulite on the sides of my stomach, near my arm pits, and on my stomach.</li>
            <li> Now let me say, this doesn&#x27;t get rid of cellulite completely, but I can already see a drastic improvement in the way</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> At night, after using the scrub on my hands, I apply this concentrate and wear gloves to keep my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> One should find what works for him/her and stick to it, only then we can achieve real result.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the clear difference on my skin looking after I used the product for probably 6 times.</li>
            <li> However, as far as reducing cellulite, it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a cellulite -free skin even after having my kid.i&#x27;m heavily into fitness and consider myself a bit of a workout \\&quot;freak\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also  believe the effects of NuElle Triple Action Cream will be complimented by diet and exercice.</li>
            <li> Well, surprise, surprise, surprise after using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for two months</li>
            <li> with some simple diet results will be fast.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NuElle triple action anti cellulite concentrate for approx.</li>
            <li> Old stretch marks and some scars have lightened quite a bit.</li>
            <li> So far, i am using for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Ive been using this formulation for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and this has not bothered my skin at all</li>
            <li> and I like all the natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> my thighs were baby soft and the cellulite smoothed out within about a week.  </li>
            <li> this is my second time using this product, and I absolutely vouch for the results.</li>
            <li> Just finished up 2 bottle of this nuelle stuff using it 2x a day, nearly every day since Valentine Day.</li>
            <li> but i was unexpectedly surprised.</li>
            <li> It has a really cool feeling that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate definitely made my thighs and buttocks area more firm.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very good--not terrible--but it doesn&#x27;t linger after the lotion is absorbed.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, It doesn&#x27;t require wrapping, stays on the skin firm and doesn&#x27;t leave the dry after-feeling.</li>
            <li> When I use it once daily, the appearance of my cellulite reduces by more than half, but when I use it twice a day (as the manufacturer recommends), I can barely notice any cellulite dimples.</li>
            <li> , I see some improvement on my cellulite specially when I use the cream every single day ( I usually only apply once a day)</li>
            <li> Just the other day when I was sitting, I happened to glance at my thighs ( had on pants), they actually looked fit and toned.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and so far I have noticed the back of my legs are way firmer and any small cellulite is definitely reducing in appearance!</li>
            <li> far as how long this bottle would last you, I’d say it depends on how much you’re using and how much area you’re covering.</li>
            <li> I love how a little amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> I blame that due to a bad diet (I do love me some good beer!) and not being as active as I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never have thought it&#x27;d be possible for me to appear so lean, I&#x27;ve gained more definition in the last two years than I had in the previous seven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never have thought it&#x27;d be possible for me to appear so lean, I&#x27;ve gained more definition in the last two years than I had in the previous seven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff personally does not work and I barely have that much cellulite</li>
            <li> I just received my second order and I am trying the scrub that goes along with this particular product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because so many creams and lotions don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all when you apply them.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually ordered a second bottle of any cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I (for the first time ever) had this unsightly cellulite on my inner thighs and above my knees.</li>
            <li> I know from past experience that caffeine and seaweed extracts work for me, but I had never seen a product with so many essential oils (juniper, cinnamon, cayenne and wintergreen oils</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see more in the next few weeks!</li>
            <li> This product in particular Im using for my 2nd time around along with their skin firming cream and its a delight to put on</li>
            <li> In our era of chemical overload, being all natural is a major plus too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried two other products of lesser value, used them exactly as was indicated in the bottles, and they didn&#x27;t really do anything for me (Jergens Skin Firming and Nivea Body Good-bye Cellulite).</li>
            <li> It is a diuretic, improves circulation, reduces the appearance of cellulite overtime, firming, detoxifying, organic and all natural which is a major factor for me.</li>
            <li> The cream is not extremely greasy and leaves skin soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream if you&#x27;re looking to lighten stretch marks, get rid of cellulite and tone up your skin overall.</li>
            <li> I’m going on another cruise next year and unlike my previous cruise, I plan to look fit and trim in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> but I noticed immediatelly that this does not dry fast enough and it smells.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a HUGE difference in how firm my thighs were!</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth bottle, and not only has my cellulite diminished, but my skin is also more firm.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, the cellulite has diminished slightly and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> As a new mom in my 30s, I am trying to get back into a bikini-worthy shape.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased based upon the reviews and used the entire bottle as directed with absolutely zero results.</li>
            <li> Its kind of crazy to think they can make this stuff to really work.</li>
            <li> noticed the diuretic properties pretty fast since it did make me sweat slightly the first few days of using it.</li>
            <li> and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle, pleasant scent, sort of like a very mild green tea-like fragrance, but not overpowering at all like some green tea perfumes.</li>
            <li> little by little I started seeing more and more improvements, I have to say I use it twice a day and at least once a day I massage the area using Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like I noticed some improved tone, but the cellulite was still very apparent.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on Amazon people said they liked the smell of this product, however when I read other reviews I saw comments about the smell being strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I used two different brands of anti-cellulite products immediately after the other and this product from Skin QR Organics worked better for me; the other product made my eczema flare up</li>
            <li> If you are truly looking to get rid of that Cellulite, look no further than NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> However the product is not magic, you must decrease processed sugar and high sodium foods, drink lots of water, along with exercising to see quick and lasting results.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way and in my personal case, it has worked far better than what my expectations were.  </li>
            <li> So then I tried NuElle, with fear that I would lose more money... and soon enough, I actually started feeling a difference after a few weeks when I realized there truly was a visual improvement.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other lotions and potions-none of them firm and get rid of my cellulite like this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a creamy but not oily feel, so I can use it right after the shower and not be afraid to have to wait until it soaks in (like some other AC products) and I can put my clothes on right away (since time is always short in the mornings).  </li>
            <li> I only wish that they made a SUPER sized bottle of this stuff because 5oz does not go a long way, especially if you used it twice daily like it says.</li>
            <li> There was a slight tingle sensation which showed the product was really working to get down into the areas where it needed to be and the product left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> When clean eating and excising was not enough, NuElle helped me reduce fat and get firm.</li>
            <li> I have used several different products before and I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, only once a day usually (not the recommended twice a day) and seeing positive results!</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really say it works.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I wouldn&#x27;t keep coming back to purchase if I didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> Also the price is reasonable and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wore it with some tights to help tighten back e flabby fats but have not seen any measurement improvements so far</li>
            <li> Actually I just bought my second bottle earlier this month because I&#x27;ve been using it so much.</li>
            <li> So far I have used one bottle of this and am currently on my second one.</li>
            <li> You can barely see it.</li>
            <li> Woman carry extra weight in the thigh area naturally.</li>
            <li> I had been using another well known firming cream and the results were only a modest 10 -15% improvement.  </li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to review a bottle of NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate.</li>
            <li> but there was enough there to make me self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old female.</li>
            <li> Barely a month into using it</li>
            <li> I am 29, so I feel old enough to start worrying about cellulite.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only found two creams that do this, this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuElle Tripple Action Anti Cellulite cream for several years.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate because it does the job.</li>
            <li> The smell is similar to an old B&amp;BW Lemon Meringue body creams that I used to use.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;2, 36 years old BF and currently weigh 122 pounds.  </li>
            <li> But I have never had any allergies and eat very heathy (minimal salt and sugar</li>
            <li> it might be too early to give a final conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely saw any results, if any.</li>
            <li> I knew very well from last time I had managed to properly reduce it, that only a combination of factors plus perseverance can make it go away.</li>
            <li> My cellulite has not disappeared completely and I will not try to be delusional and expect that it can happen, but I believe that I see some improvement when it comes to ripple look on the back of my thighs and firmness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my upper arms, stomach, and legs and bum, applying it at least once a day in the evenings, but twice a day when I could remember, and started noticing that the areas seemed tighter and more even after around 2 weeks, and by 4 weeks there was definitely a noticable difference!</li>
            <li> It is thick, and has a light smell.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all products of this kind</li>
            <li> can honestly attest to the fact that because I have used this product my upper thighs, and bottom now have a much decreased visual appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping it would work but prepared for disappointment since one often hears the refrain, “If something sounds too good to be true….”  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other cellulite creams over the last year and some seemed to work a little bit</li>
            <li> That other jar of cream runs out seemingly a little faster, but I had much better results and much faster results, so I will be going back to the other cream again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle which lasted 3 and a half weeks using it twice a day from ankles to butt.</li>
            <li> The cream gives your skin a &amp;#34;pump,&amp;#34; so your dimples look much less noticeable even just after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have used many other creams in the past (fat girl scrub from Bliss, homemade mixtures, Nivea anti-C serum AND lotion)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this cellulite cream, and have noticed a major difference in the quality of my skin on my thighs and butt!</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent but not strong at all, and its a scent that is refreshing to have on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a good smell like some I&#x27;ve had but not horrible and disturbing for sure.</li>
            <li> just  received some samples of other products and very exited  to test out.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t really have an answer for me, except that maybe I am allergic or retaining water due to salty food/sodium intake/ stress/ monthly cycle.</li>
            <li> Unlike other gels I have used in the past, this product is a thick, silky cream that allows a fairly lengthy massage before being absorbed completely (that in itself provides half the benefit).</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with the little bit extra I needed since I am a clean eater and exercise regularly already.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that my cellulite is very minimal so that may be why I can already see results, but this product really does work.</li>
            <li> The product is all natural and organic and is formulated to not only work on the outside of your skin but deeper into the skin layers as well.</li>
            <li> Not a waste of money actually the opposite!!  </li>
            <li> The older I get, the harder it is to keep up with time and its consequences.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very complete formula compared to more expensive brands; I just wish there was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation isn&#x27;t very strong with this product, and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable, unbearable, or something that would prevent you from wanting to use it.  </li>
            <li> Before using the NuElle product the ripples of my cellulite were visible through some of my tighter fitting pants -- not a good look!  </li>
            <li> You will notice some firming right after using it, but this only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive and mainstreet treatments and many in between, with little success.</li>
            <li> (Also, not sure if they do anything more or less than this one).</li>
            <li> I began using firming lotions in the beginning of 2010, twice a day, every day, in an effort to get rid of some stubborn inches around my torso left over from the years of less than stellar eating.</li>
            <li> generally apply it once a day, but when i remember to do the second application i can notice faster results.  </li>
            <li> I generally use it twice daily and massage for 1 minute morning &amp; night.</li>
            <li> The texture was a bit lighter than other regular lotions which did not make it greasy but very absorbent.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to use it for at least a full month or two.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt firmer after the first few applications.</li>
            <li> have tried other creams before, cheap and expensive, but have found that this one actually works better than my other current cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to stick to a regimen if I don&#x27;t see results fairly quick.</li>
            <li> i usually put it on right before yoga or work-outs.</li>
            <li> What I like about this cream is that my thigh and backside skin has become tighter, so much softer, and the dimples are a lot less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Once it soaks in, it does feel slightly tacky to the touch, but that is a small thing compared to the benefits and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, after only a week or so of using it twice daily (most days-</li>
            <li> I used the the first bottle and noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many creams, gels, and serums ranging from reasonably priced to very expensive.</li>
            <li> The other reason I apply this in the morning is because it is really quite heavy; on one hand my (male) skin stays unbelievable soft, even 8-12 hours later when I apply the other, more absorbent lotion.</li>
            <li> They send you a free sample with ever purchase, and a small magazine with all of their other spa products.</li>
            <li> and that kind of restriction is a little tough to be mindful of.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I actually saw results within the first few weeks!!!!</li>
            <li> so I was so surprise when I noticed significant difference on my skin in just a few weeks, smoother and less rippled.</li>
            <li> fat?).The most amazing thing for me about this cream is its firming action.my skin is firmer and the ugly little fatty bumps are not growing any bigger.</li>
            <li> I just have moderate cellulite, and I have been using it with my vacuum cup.</li>
            <li> It does not tingle, or have that cold feeling that other firming creams have that I&#x27;ve used in the past which I enjoy, it does however have a strong smell of fruit loops!</li>
            <li> I really rubbed it in there after I showered and let it dry all the way by laying belly down on my bed for a while before I put pants on.</li>
            <li> I observed small but positive changes as short as after a week of use.</li>
            <li> They are called Jar of Vacuum Cellulite Massage.</li>
            <li> When the bottle is new, that piston is siting all the way down at the bottom of the bottle.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very nice to know im not putting crap on my skin that will soak in to my body.</li>
            <li> I have noticed positive results after just a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> I am going to look into other products in this line, as they seem to be all natural.</li>
            <li> I like also that this products is so natural because I have read somewhere that accumulation of toxins (aka chemicals) is another reason of cellulite along with other health issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing dry brushing for a few months to combat cellulite and decided to add this cream to my regime based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product has worked for me - at least, not any better than much less expensive skin-firming lotions available at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> And even better, it was a few bucks cheaper than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past that was claiming the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m not sure that three weeks have given it enough time to make real visible changes in cellulite.</li>
            <li> definitely works for as long as you&#x27;re using it regularly.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long, it is only stinky when you initally put the lotion on.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to see if it actually works</li>
            <li> You can barely see your cellulite!!&amp;#34;  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because, like other reviewers, I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this cream and only after a few days of using it my cellulite is more pronounced and worse than ever before.</li>
            <li> It is hard to see the cellulite in the first picture</li>
            <li> This seems to be working , I need to give it a little more time to really tell as it is too cold to wear shorts now.</li>
            <li> Bottles are to small and cost to much to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of the cream on in the morning and at night, and I really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have skipped the gym for at least 3 years and start seeing the cellulite for the first time a year ago.  </li>
            <li> It will start working on deleting the cellulite on the surface of your skin first, as least that is what I noticed as I used this product.  </li>
            <li> also used this on the back of my legs as I have cellulite problems there, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big change in that area (compared to my arms at least).</li>
            <li> But no matter how much I work out or diet, I can&#x27;t seem to lose the small amount of cottage cheese on my legs.</li>
            <li> Back in January I was recommended this product by a friend who&#x27;s been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> My belly is almost close to flat, I just wanted to try this</li>
            <li> so I can get that tone and flat belly</li>
            <li> I have tried two different products during this time frame (one more expensive and one less expensive) and I get better results with NuElle.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer for my thighs and behind, but there was more work to do there...</li>
            <li> but now they are flat!</li>
            <li> So I find the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream daily along with massage and dry brushing and notice no difference.  </li>
            <li> When I was on my first bottle, there were minor results but at least I noticed them.</li>
            <li> I also drink roasted dandelion root tea for extra help with detoxing and I use a massager with this cream or dry brush before to increase absorbency and fight the stubborn areas.</li>
            <li> Therefore I am training for 1-2 hours a day, 5 days a week, have changed my diet to a much healthier one, renounced to late dinners, focused on my water intake, and daily scrubbed and applied the cream.</li>
            <li> My thighs stuck together and my rear end stuck to the toilet seat.</li>
            <li> I thought that adding this lotion into my daily routine would be the key but the bottle is now empty and nothing has changed ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the product itself, it has a weird peppermint/mint smell that is really strong.</li>
            <li> this one works ladies, the scent is herbal, utilizing the main essential oils that combat cellulite so don&#x27;t expect a flowery scent, its more like a lemongrass base.</li>
            <li> I think a product like this really needs long term use, at least using the entire product up before you can truly know how well it works.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never spent money on other cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged mother of two teenage sons and have always seemed to struggle with a little extra weight around my middle and on my hips and upper thighs along with stretch marks from having children.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I have been using this product now for 6 months after having tried the vella smooth at American Laser Center which was AWFUL</li>
            <li> I have wasted countless dollars on various products, cheaper and more expensive.</li>
            <li> With other recent efforts I&#x27;ve lost almost 10 lbs over the last 3 months and this product has worked to reduce cellulite and keep up with slackening skin.</li>
            <li> Of the 3 different products that all fight cellulite, that I have had the opportunity to test, try and review, each of them have what is called a &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; feel due to the essential oils.  </li>
            <li> You remove the clear plastic lid, press the button and squirt a little on your fingertips.</li>
            <li> I have lost 135 pounds in the last year which has left me with a lot of loose saggy skin that is not very desirable.</li>
            <li> I quickly learned that if I dry off well it absorbs and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling or residue behind.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would live up to all of its positive reviews, but I sadly cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had very minor, almost not visible on my inner thigh, but i got scared and decided to try this one, it worked for me, but i am running and working out every single day.</li>
            <li> at least 5 times a week;sometimes twice a day for intense routines.</li>
            <li> We have purchased several of these bottles and which it would never go empty because we keep re ordering</li>
            <li> The cellulite is not completely gone</li>
            <li> Although I did not believe in the claims of the manufacture, I still ordered the NuElle Triple action cellulite cream and wanted to cancel it few times before it shipped coz</li>
            <li> I rate this a 3 because I haven&#x27;t had it for that long.  </li>
            <li> and I’ve tried a few, but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I am a regular shape woman size 6, but have a few areas that need extra attention, like back of my legs and sides of my knees.</li>
            <li> I normally put it on twice or once a day usually before I workout around by hips.</li>
            <li> but I felt it on my legs all day long.  </li>
            <li> It smells lemony and the smell lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different product before but this cream is the only one that actually works!</li>
            <li> , my body will remain that way for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use on my upper arms and armpit, sad but true.</li>
            <li> apply the Nuelle twice a day, there is a very subtle citrus scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what exactly worked, or may be the combination, but my skin was smother and my stomach was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;About how long lasts the bottle: I noticed today that the bottle I am using is already half way through.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to bash any of the many other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but if you&#x27;re like me and have tried everything under the sun with poor results then you definitely need to try this out.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re only getting about half the volume that it appears from the outside of the container.\\&quot;  ...</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ve got to keep using it for long lasting effects - as any other product.</li>
            <li> Only other issue is the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought other products to help with my cellulite problem and saw no results, I purchased this product last spring used it as directed and noticed results within 2wks</li>
            <li> have tried other products and it does not compare to this one using the application method I described above.  </li>
            <li> I only used the other cream once as soon as I realized</li>
            <li> I have used several other lotions that supposedly reduce cellulite</li>
            <li> I know there are lots of other similar products like this one out there, but this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with, along with the body scrub.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I gave this product only 4 stars due to the nature of the bottle and the size.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other anti-cellulite creams with no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is firmer with NuElle than with other creams and gels said to fight cellulite, but there is no substitute for proper exercise.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile  switched back and forth trying others in between and none other even comes close.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very strange odor that made me gag.</li>
            <li> I have been dry brushing twice a day before showering and have been using this twice a day as well.</li>
            <li> I use a dry skin brush and brush my thighs, buttocks and stomach to get rid of any dry skin and bring circulation to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Them remove the plastic and let your skin air dry for a couple minutes before you put you close on.</li>
            <li> I recommend using dry brush before shower and massage with body massager after applying.</li>
            <li> After you shower, and when you dry off, you want to rub the concentrate on your tummy, bum, and thighs.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately saw no results(i eat clean and exercise)</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a coffee scrub and dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and the bottle only lasts a couple weeks when used as recommended, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I like that this organic concentrate is intended to firm the surface of the skin and go deeply to reduce fat cell clusters and water retention at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost over a hundred pounds in that last 4 years, and I&#x27;ve got a lot of loose hanging skin that I wanted to try to firm up especially in my thigh area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and have seen limited results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use this every single day or even twice a day as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle and used it every single day.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the bottle does not last very long especially if you use the lotion twice a day so it can get a bit pricey...</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of other products for cellulite, but I never really noticed big results.</li>
            <li> past week I reviewed the Skin QR Organics NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate.</li>
            <li> have tried at least 5 other products like this and really like the pump design.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I always gain a few extra pounds over the winter and need to work harder to bounce back in the spring.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item not too long ago, using the cream every day, and seeing minimal results already.</li>
            <li> I have had 5 babies and have lots of flab and loose skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change in that some of my loose skin is appearing firmer in my abdominal area as well as my thighs.  </li>
            <li> It CAN help you loose cellulite, stretch your skin and increase its elasticity while you are on a diet, exercising, drinking plenty of water, massaging the area.</li>
            <li> I do this to \\&quot;mix it up,\\&quot; as the products have different ingredients, and to keep the costs down.</li>
            <li> so I recommend using this product lower down to treat areas that can have cellulite like your stomach or legs rather than your upper arms.</li>
            <li> I know deep down</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, especially if you massage it into your skin well.  </li>
            <li> Ive seen others half that size for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have tried different products in the past, but with this one you can actually SEE the changes.</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 5 stars if the bottles were bigger or cost less.</li>
            <li> ,my cellulites are visible less after my second botlhe, i recomend this cream, defynily deserve a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also less than flattering, so I have only been applying it at night when I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I&#x27;ll smell.</li>
            <li> Also, I can feel the difference in my skin and body parts where I have used this product that the cellulite is actually decreasing, like it&#x27;s being burned off (from a workout when I say burned off) and not just being hidden.  </li>
            <li> In the last year I have been seriously exercising and trying to reduce these areas along with the extra sag under my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I am now using it again or year and a half later</li>
            <li> You can see I still have cellulite to the back of my legs, but it is definitely much less.</li>
            <li> I got this originally based on other product reviews, but I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I recommend this 100 percent, especially for the girls who have less.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as rough and dry.</li>
            <li> I like the faint smell and the feel of the lotion, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I begin to panic when my last bottle is half empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I stopped using this as the difference was ultimately not significant enough.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see little differences</li>
            <li> I only use this once a day because you get so little of it</li>
            <li> I have been working out, but this has added a little extra to help tone my thighs and stomach and remove the bumpiness of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Overnight my thighs looked soft and a little firm.</li>
            <li> and I will not be able to finish the bottle and that will be a even bigger disappointment because I spent my hard earned cash for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have any negative things to say about it.</li>
            <li> 2 pumps are enough per application and small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think so far I have re-ordered at least 3 or bottles.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday twice daily...  </li>
            <li> The product was carefully packed and the bottle was neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream a few times</li>
            <li> the harder</li>
            <li> Kinda, expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with whatever I use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this cream actually helped to decrease the cellulite appearance and firm the skin on my legs and butt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try using it for a few months to see how well that works when used regularly.</li>
            <li> After a botched slim lipo procedure a few years back</li>
            <li> but there has been ABSOLUTELY NO IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER.  </li>
            <li> used the product until the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products to help firm my aging and self-abused skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be crushed if they discontinue this.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times because I have notice my thights and arms have firm.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this cream by a sales person at a local spa a few month ago. .</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money because it simply does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not too fond of the smell, but you get used to it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I know I will never get rid of my cellulite, but the improved appearance has made me a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> for the rest of that bottle I just scooped it out with my fingers and duct-taped the bottle closed for the trip home.</li>
            <li> I use this product after the shower everyday for the last 2 months</li>
            <li> There was no menthol feel which is what I expected</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I have to say I have noticed a definite difference!</li>
            <li> I spent the previous two summers in long capri pants and bermuda shorts that covered my knees.</li>
            <li> I used up the scrub long before the NuElle and decided not to re-order the scrub because it was expensive, didn&#x27;t last long and got very thin very quickly (I guess water getting into the container).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can be the first to say, that there really are no quick fixes:(</li>
            <li> I think a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> For back of my upper thighs: LITTLE &amp; SLOW results..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that any cream could help my issues, but this seems to be making some changes.  </li>
            <li> I can feel it working un like other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> Then figured that before trying out needle, I must try other things out there.</li>
            <li> The other reviews say this product work....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at my first purchase, but now I’m on bottle number four.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird at first</li>
            <li> Stop wasting time, money, and hope on other items and give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried different products in the past and nothing has ever worked.</li>
            <li> Now, I am not sure if this product actually does anything</li>
            <li> I have used products in the past that heat up and turn my skin red.</li>
            <li> If you are not completely satisfied with the product the company is offering a no questions asked Money Back</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any other change.</li>
            <li> and since I don&#x27;t have darker skin my cellulite is extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a lot of the other cups</li>
            <li> I have been only using this for a few days but am already noticing a difference!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to also try out other products under this brand-name.</li>
            <li> I exercised, tried other creams, massages and now I don&#x27;t have to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also ordered the other products of Skin QR Organics.  </li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients to other lotions I used before</li>
            <li> (may due to sweating)</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I noticed a definite reduction in cellulite, I have just a bit on my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and none have ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have done it without any other cellulite devices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really small weighing only about 100 pounds up until my sophomore year in college.</li>
            <li> It feels like any other creams or lotions that I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried other stuff for cellulite problem but nothing worked like Nuelle.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand I believe no product can do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other cellulite creams, this one had NO offensive odor, and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have a serious yo-yo diet problem that has most likely contributed to my serious \\&quot;cellulite\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Even though I am 57 and really active, I have been bothered by some dimpling on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin feels firmer and small dimples seem a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have not seen dramatic results since I have only been using it for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> OMG, the first time that I bought this I was a little bit skeptical, however I read the reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but for such a natural product that works</li>
            <li> Recently I broke my leg and was unable to bare weight on my leg</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works long term - not sure</li>
            <li> at least for the next 2 weeks, then I’ll be even again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am an average size and even when I am at my fittest, any remaining fat is always lumpy.</li>
            <li> you will remember to use it at least daily.</li>
            <li> Only negative point is its smell.  </li>
            <li> Reviews look VERY suspicious and fake</li>
            <li> this is a white cream when comes out and rather thick.</li>
            <li> The scent is not great (like macerating herbs) but it doesn&#x27;t linger and the quantity of cream I&#x27;m using disappears completely without staining my clothes.</li>
            <li> .. I would describe it like a sour citronella candle.  </li>
            <li> My jiggle has gone down exponentially and my thighs seemed to be gaining their lost glory.</li>
            <li> But than months after using this product I see my stomach, legs, and arm slimming down.</li>
            <li> In off season I am about 15% body fat and in season I go down to 7% body fat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer (FrostBear) is talking about?!?</li>
            <li> And if I run&lt;br /&gt;out, I can definitely tell the difference after not using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> - I spent over $3500 with them and GOT NOTHING!!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is a bit expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long for me as I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> , when I look down at my thighs, I see much less rippling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few other products since trying this one.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results from this product to reduce cellulite - possibly because mine is very minor -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for about 6 weeks and do seem to see tightening of my skin and less cellulite.  </li>
            <li> However, they do seem to be less defined.</li>
            <li> The Cellulite is less defined now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Firmer skin and noticeable less cellulite.</li>
            <li> but i have lots of cellulite on my thigh and this product make it less</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin looks smoother and less rippled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using it, and I also do the cupping, but even when I&#x27;m not doing that for a couple of days I still see way less cellulite on my stomach.</li>
            <li> No more dry patchy spots on my legs and its organic!</li>
            <li> See firmer thigh and less cellulite after one week of use.</li>
            <li> less than a two week period</li>
            <li> I am looking for a cream that can tighten the skin a bit, so the cellulite becomes less visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the stretch marks fading and getting less and less over the 9-10 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> Have seen a slight improvement in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> They also claim it creates a slight sauna effect</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight warmth when it&#x27;s rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is firmer and tighter and slight</li>
            <li> Tighter skin and less visible cellulite.</li>
            <li> Also remembering to apply is daily was difficult as stated above and again for me placing in the shower</li>
            <li> luckily, i am not diluted about the results that i could expect.</li>
            <li> after just a couple of weeks i noticed my skin looking smoother and less rippled.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item a couple times now, and I think it truly does work as long as you are DILIGENT about using it everyday, or at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little tingling, but nothing that slowed me down or made me not want to use it again.</li>
            <li> (warming, not tingling or burning) which was crazy to me at first</li>
            <li> but when you get past 35 it is harder to keep the elasticity in your skin tight, so this products helps with that.</li>
            <li> I also find it very inconvenient to not be able to eat for one hour after as I usually have my shower and eat breakfast afterwards.</li>
            <li> My thigh area is smoother in the feel and slightly looks less uneven.</li>
            <li> I switched to a different highly rated brand and it was so bad.</li>
            <li> I was *very* skeptical of this but decided to go ahead and try it out due to all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of use I could already notice a slight difference.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it twice a day, my skin became smoother and much less dimply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, no burning effects or sensation, cream leaves a little sticky feeling after rubbing in.</li>
            <li> Not one little change.  </li>
            <li> but you do get a little warming in the area that you apply</li>
            <li> I would like it though if they made this cream a little easier to spread.</li>
            <li> that no matter how in shape I get, there is always this little bit of cellulite that just never goes away.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m encouraged to see improvements, little by little.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about the sauna effect that you might feel after applying the cream to your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit tacky for a little bit after applying but that goes away</li>
            <li> Little is also needed each use.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted me a little over a month</li>
            <li> Can take a little time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> I began using it a little over a month twice a day in conjunction with the sauna belt for my stomach and thighs.  </li>
            <li> I also incoporated a healthier diet and a little excercise (Squats, lunges, leg lifts).</li>
            <li> you can pump out as much or as little as you want.</li>
            <li> but this product got rid of that in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> keeps me firm and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cellulite products with little or no results after weeks.</li>
            <li> but i know in a few weeks it will be and</li>
            <li> I can tell that it&#x27;s been helping to firm and tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I can see result after few times using it</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks before we went on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> I dont leave the house without this, and I wear shorts practically year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Now I decided to put it on the area under my chin to firm the skin there as well.</li>
            <li> NuElle cream worked within a few weeks and along with working out</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After one tube it appears to firm my skin</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and this is part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money..</li>
            <li> this is not an investment that you want to waste your money on.  </li>
            <li> This cream is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to women out there who have trouble getting rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer</li>
            <li> The results showed up within a few weeks after using it twice a day but it kept getting better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I exercise a few days a week</li>
            <li> I realize, in order to keep the results, I will have to continue using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday</li>
            <li> Visible results are not going to appear in a few days</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW MONTHS AND I&#x27;LL</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now in conjunction with the L&#x27;or De La Mer Organic Cellulite Blaster.</li>
            <li> and I do believe I wasted my money</li>
            <li> The lotion will give you a firm skin feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, 2x a day with a massager.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy or with a funky viscosity.</li>
            <li> I like it for keeping my skin toned and firm.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money and time, don&#x27;t now what I was thinking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> this is a waste.</li>
            <li> but this is a waste and</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this bottle for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money..</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday in the shower .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The appearance of my cellulite has decreased in only two months.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I started seeing a noticeable difference in my thighs.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone that has some cellulite and wants to firm up some stubborn areas!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I see less cellulite on my butt!</li>
            <li> but I will say that there is no strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my arms, thighs and belly twice a day and have noticed dramatic improvement, especially in my arms; they are firmer and slender.</li>
            <li> not strong or perfume smelling.  </li>
            <li> This product smells very odd.  </li>
            <li> so I have cellulite pretty bad.</li>
            <li> smell is very herbal but doesnt linger unpleasantly.</li>
            <li> I have lost a lot of weight during the past few months, and I had issues with my skin looking \\&quot;loose\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> To give you a background of my problem areas - I workout at least 10 hours a week and am 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and 125 lbs and wear XS tops and S size pants as my lower half is bulkier.</li>
            <li> I waited at least a half hour before I dressed</li>
            <li> I like to use it after my morning showers and one of the times I didn’t dry off well because I was running behind on time it made the lotion feel sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> After six weeks of forced inactivity with a broken leg, I was left with some excess fat and visible cellulite on my thighs and bottom.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it works!</li>
            <li> Nothing eliminates cellulite but this lotion seems to minimize its appearance at least a little.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I at least see a little change.</li>
            <li> I used this 2 - 3 times a day, in conjunction with a roller, and noticed very little to no effect.</li>
            <li> But with that very appreciated weight gain, the cellulite came :(.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about 2 months and feel like I may be seeing some small results.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if it was going to work.</li>
            <li> And this one has the greater misfortune to have a terrible smell to it.</li>
            <li> It does have a scent, but not sure what - maybe lemony.</li>
            <li> No more research for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products to get rid of my cellulite and none of them worked until now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Paleo, the Insanity or the cream</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> There is no magic bullet.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no magic</li>
            <li> Not sure about the cellulite part yet put I do feel as if I&#x27;m losing water weight using it on my hips thighs and stomach</li>
            <li> (at times it would seem like there was some lag between the fat-loss and the firming, giving a small intermediate period of sagging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the past month my skin condition and appearance of cellulite was gradually improving.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and have been for the past month now</li>
            <li> I’ve started using this product already so that when summer 2015 arrives, my cellulite will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its working or not</li>
            <li> (I usually order 3-4 bottles at a time).</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my cellulite is just a small dimple and dare I say that my thighs are thinner?</li>
            <li> because I do like to stay far away from artificial anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of creams to reduce cellulite over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve lost over 40 pounds in the past year.</li>
            <li> Being that I am a small girl I do have cellulite in my thigh and butt area and for no one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a metal can type of container, so if you pump breaks, I am really not sure how you would get the cream out...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams, pills, even expensive treatments, and have stopped using them due to the poor results.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER after reading other reviews I thought I would give  it a shot, after all at the very least</li>
            <li> Overall, very disappointed in this product as I had high hopes that it would work for me!</li>
            <li> , i massage problem areas very firmly</li>
            <li> It was less expensive than a lot of the other ones I tried also.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is active, thin, manages their diet but still has lumpy</li>
            <li> diet an exercise I am very pale</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure why there are couple negative reviews about the smell of the cream.</li>
            <li> but the instructions are a mile long on what time of day to use (2x before or after meals, kinda absurd).</li>
            <li> I rub myself too hard thinking</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle along with the L&#x27;Or de la Mer Annti Cellulite Body Blaster scrub, which I used in the shower with a hard scrubber thing.</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter, firmer and there is hardly none</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recently started playing tennis and could never wear the tennis skirts coz of the awkward cellulite and jiggling skin on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Like lack of negative ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream that went on smooth, did not smell horrible and did the job.  </li>
            <li> I get plenty of protein from chicken, Greek yogurt, beans, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am using for a week, but not a warm up feeling or anything.</li>
            <li> reviews mention the aroma as a negative, but I find the scent pleasing.  </li>
            <li> Well at least with me it did.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smells and too thick to put on.  </li>
            <li> but i did notice some improvement in my thighs and butt within the past couple of weeks of using it!</li>
            <li> It is not magic!</li>
            <li> I imagine for someone that has a small cellulite problem, this product will do wonders!  </li>
            <li> If they noticed, it must mean its working.</li>
            <li> Anxious to see in another month of every day usage!  </li>
            <li> and I mean none, cellulite appearance on my thighs or buttock area at all.  </li>
            <li> I mean understanding what it can and what it can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half and IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and after about 2 wks I noticed a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> I seriously did not expect this to work.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t understand how this worked for others.</li>
            <li> Overall this product isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I feel that it was not a good investment of my money.</li>
            <li> well, that was not a good idea at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they made a larger size :( .  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything: creams, lasers, massagers and everything left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, I could not get to sleep at all, I kept on tossing and turning, I felt fidgety and too anxious and was like what the heck is wrong with me</li>
            <li> Other  reviews had mentioned the odor being  unpleasant  </li>
            <li> Ill admit I had some questionable looking areas under my buttocks and on my thighs, a little rippled</li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> They actually make a difference and cost 1/4 of what I paid for this crap.</li>
            <li> though is it doesn&#x27;t linger or get worse, by morning</li>
            <li> But alas.</li>
            <li> it from getting worse by using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approximately two weeks now.</li>
            <li> And does it get worse before improving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even took a photo after using it and my cellulite is significantly worse than before.  </li>
            <li> My legs looked worse than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> It has been very frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic</li>
            <li> and I can already see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I have used it since January and have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Hated the scent and the lotion left my legs feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I have bad cellulite on my thighs and butt it has improved by at least 50 percent after 2 bottles of this cream and using it once a day.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time managing twice a day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sadly I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up the usage, but I did use three bottles before my wedding/honeymoon and it DID appear to work.</li>
            <li> sorry did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Just placed my second order for this product and ordered 2 this time because I hated being without it for 4 days!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any change in the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with getting the cellulite under control.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give the product 5 stars was because the lotion smells awful.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too overpowering…it smells faintly of baby powder, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> use the massage item sometimes on my thighs plus the difficult</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, nothing gets rid of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> (I know, its weird),</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, so I am going to use it sparingly and hope it continues to work.  </li>
            <li> yes,i was unfortunately gaining weight.</li>
            <li> So, girls we all have those trouble areas which we all hate, no matter what size we are.</li>
            <li> sadly somehow deleted my before picture.</li>
            <li> however will my clothes off I am still just as insecure.</li>
            <li> The look and feel of the product: SMELLS WEIRD, FEELS OILY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so were the expensive technologies I lost my money</li>
            <li> It is moisurizing, lightweight and absorb well, but sadly has had no effect on the celluite I have on my legs.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Just skeptical about this and</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i dont like this product</li>
            <li> I am very thin and have virtually no body fat</li>
            <li> The visible cellulite (giving that awful “orange skin” appearance) has almost disappeared and I have to squeeze my flesh to see any little unevenness.</li>
            <li> am afraid that it will soon not function</li>
            <li> unhappy</li>
            <li> it stinks</li>
            <li> intake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so afraid this cream has ruined my legs.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical of all cellulite products.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still there but not as bad</li>
            <li> itching so bad</li>
            <li> \\&quot;How bad</li>
            <li> I have really bad cellulite.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad of a smell.</li>
            <li> But have always been frustrated</li>
            <li> , the smell makes me sick, it smells like fish, i tried to avoid the smell in hopes of it working</li>
            <li> For me, the odor was strong…not unpleasant, but I’d hate to lather it all over me before sitting close to someone.</li>
            <li> but there is no change in the appearance of the bumps under the skin :-(</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Rather disappointed...</li>

            <li> Does work better than anything else I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different creams, workouts, you name it, if they told me standing on my head for an hour worked I would probably do it too. You have to keep at it to see results, I think it was week three that I saw a difference. I was about to give up and just pile it in with the others but I kept going and i&#x27;m so glad I did. I really rubbed it in there after I showered and let it dry all the way by laying belly down on my bed for a while before I put pants on. I even think I was only applying it once a day on week one, which might be why it took a while to work but do it twice a day and stick to it even if it looks like it&#x27;s not working because my cellulite is hereditary and I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it since puberty hit more years ago than I care to say and I have to admit I am amazed at the results. Ordering like four more bottles because this summer I will not be caught off guard!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream! As a new mom in my 30s, I am trying to get back into a bikini-worthy shape. This cream has been really good! I noticed results within about 2 weeks. This is really amazing, especially because I&#x27;ve tried a number of other creams with no noticeable results. Plus, it is organic and is priced very reasonably. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> So far I like this it smells fresh n clean.hope it really works as I just bought this.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels smoother and softer .  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This cream has been absolutely lovely on my skin! I loved the fact that is has so many cellulite fighting ingredients. I have noticed firmer more toned skin and have had no issues. I highly recommend this cream if you&#x27;re looking to lighten stretch marks, get rid of cellulite and tone up your skin overall. It smells great and applies nicely. I use it all over body because it&#x27;s that great. *I receive products complimentary to review, all opinions are 100% mine and after use of product*</li>
            <li> I bought this cream about 2 month ago, and so far I am very happy with it. It make my skin soft and elastic, smells good. Before this one I was using Vichy&#x27;s products, and I think this is better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been months since I bought it and no results at all. The smell is not that bad. I will continue using it. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This product works! I have used plenty of other products for cellulite, but I never really noticed big results. Finally something that worked! I noticed results fairly quickly too. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and after about 2 wks I noticed a subtle difference. This product is definitely worth trying I&#x27;m excited to see the difference after using it for a few months! Excellent seller very very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after daily use for a month.</li>
            <li> This works!!! First off...this is the first review I have ever written...and I am writing about it because it works!! I have tried so many other cellulite creams over the last year and some seemed to work a little bit but when I came across this product and read the reviews I thought I might as well give it a try. And I am so glad I did!! I have been dry brushing twice a day before showering and have been using this twice a day as well. I started to notice a difference after a couple weeks and now it&#x27;s been about a month and it definitely has been a huge improvement!!! I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works, in fast period of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cellulite cream for over a month now and am so excited with the results!  I have been using this twice a day along with a healthy diet and exercise and have dropped 3 inches around my gut!  I wouldn&#x27;t credit it all to the cream, however, the integrity of the skin on my belly is looking smoother and nicer.  I have had 5 babies and have lots of flab and loose skin. I love how light this cream is when applied.  It smells great and you can immediately feel it start to work. I was skeptical at first that any cream could help my issues, but this seems to be making some changes.  I also love all the healthy ingredients.  No worries about adding unwanted toxins into my body! Great product. :-)</li>
            <li> My wife has tried several cream all of which she never makes it to the end of them. We have purchased several of these bottles and which it would never go empty because we keep re ordering bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it right after we get out of the shower and rub it in. It just works. Do not buy another brand or cream...just get this one and put it on your problem areas and watch it assist in restoring your skin structure and tightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The areas we use it are: upper legs, upper arms, glute area, love handle, and stomach. soooo pretty much every where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the pump bottle is really nice and gives you a consistent amount each time.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle.  This product is great.  It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and almost cellulite free.  I use one of those rubber massagers to work it into all of the problem areas.  It smells great too!  Instructions say to apply twice per day.  I only use once per day with very good results.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!  I use it everyday twice daily...  My cellulite has definitely diminished and my skin is silky smooth.  I would buy it again!!  I also eat well daily, drink 3 litres of water daily,  and exercise 3 or 4 times per week.</li>
            <li> I can feel it working un like other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve used... I like this one very much</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great product that WORKS!!!! Finally. I have wasted countless dollars on various products, cheaper and more expensive. Not usually writing reviews, but this product is worth all the bragging and effort to write it. It’s great. Less expensive than some others that call themselves ‘best’ and it’s worth every penny. Size is good too. It’s easily lasts a month and twenty something dollar investment per month is nothing. I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural which I love and it works which I love more!  Nothing is a miracle product, you have to work out so you actually have some muscle.  But cellulite is something that always wants to be at the party.  Using this will keep that person you don&#x27;t want at the party busy on someone else&#x27;s thighs, butt, arms and gut.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and it works!! I have also tries fat girl slim and cellulean and this is the best! I had great results.</li>
            <li> Loving this actually needing to buy some more because I&#x27;m running out of first can/bottle, I&#x27;m breastfeeding, eating healthy,  waisting training and exercising and with this as extra help i think works especially for an person who had a c - section and has to wait 8 - wks to exercise I think it&#x27;s helping my stomach and side fat improve alot new results every week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update i purchased more since last year and i am rubbing it in morning before my waist trainer and evening after i take my waist trainer off, no crazy results yet but i know in a few weeks it will be and im pretty excited about that, especially since im a lot smaller than what i was before when first buying this product.</li>
            <li> NuElle Cellulite Cream Triple Action - Does an excellent job compared to the product that is twice as much with same results.  Highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend.  Cellulite Looks about 50% better with using this product.  Great moisturizer also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now.  I have to admit that I am seeing an improvement in the reduction of cellulite.  The cellulite is not completely gone but it does look better.  The cream also makes my skin feel so soft. I like that that product is organic. I use the product twice a day.</li>
            <li> I screwed up my order and the seller did a great job fixing it for me!  I used the the first bottle and noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin within a few days.  The product does make a difference in the appearance of the cellulite, I ordered another bottle to see if it will get rid of it all the way. I will update the review after the second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 months and I can tell a difference in skin appearance..the formula is non-greasy and soaks into the skin really well with no unpleasant scent or stickiness. The product is always packaged well with prompt arrival. Definitely so far the best product I&#x27;ve tried for the prevention of cellulite.</li>
            <li> My review: Product smells great. It feels refreshing to your skin. The cream is light, smoothing and absorbent.  I can tell that it&#x27;s been helping to firm and tighten my skin. Although no product will completely take away cellulite, I can see it helps in the reduction in appearance.</li>
            <li> No results yet. Only had for a week but will continue to use it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use it...i like the smell.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly in the mail.  I have been using it for awhile and have noticed a significant difference and my skin looks smoother.  It is a smooth cream so its not sticky like some.  It has a nice sweet smell also which I like.  Not too overpowering!  I would suggest others try it!!  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It really works!! I can see result after few times using it</li>
            <li> Been using this cream daily along with massage and dry brushing and notice no difference.  I eat clean, exercise and am not large but have always had issues with cellulite on my legs.  I guess we&#x27;re all looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that makes us feel better about ourselves.  Save ur money on this one.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks before we went on vacation.  It appeared as if the my thighs were smoother, however, I had upped my work-out and tightened my diet, so it could have been that... I used it at night before bed and used an electric light heated massage in a circular motion to hopefully increase the acceptance of the lotion.  I also used the scrub 2-3 days a week along with it.  Both products went quickly though.  I ordered another shipment of both because we&#x27;re about to go on vacation, however, I ordered in on the 5th and it hasn&#x27;t recorded as shipping yet and today&#x27;s the 8th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came today, the 10th, earlier than expected, so I&#x27;m pleased.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted on whether it seems to work like it did last time.</li>
            <li> This is just my second time using it, but I am 100% sure that I will continue using it over and over again. The product is very easy to use, It doesn&#x27;t require wrapping, stays on the skin firm and doesn&#x27;t leave the dry after-feeling. Rather than that, it makes it feel moisturized and very soft. On top of that, right after the first bottle have finished, I already saw a large difference. Can&#x27;t imagine what will happen after a couple of other bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing product. Recommended for everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week or two. I have a difficult time managing twice a day bc you&#x27;re supposed to put it on 2-3 hours after eating (bc otherwise you&#x27;re burning the food you ate?!) and that kind of restriction is a little tough to be mindful of. I don&#x27;t notice any burning, though it&#x27;s kind of thick and almost sticky after putting it on so I can imagine it can be that way (like putting on lotion after a burn, trapping in heat). I do see some improvement though and feel like I&#x27;d get additional results if I was more consistent. Only other issue is the smell. It smells nasty. Kind of wigs my dogs out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased my second bottle. I&#x27;ve used for about 6 weeks and do seem to see tightening of my skin and less cellulite.  Nothing dramatic but it is working.  I especially noticed that it&#x27;s helped on tightening the look of my ABS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer (FrostBear) is talking about?!? This stuff not only works, it works quickly. I am using it with the scrub that goes along with it and I have seen results the first week. I workout 6 times a week, drink plenty of water and watch my diet, so perhaps that is helping my results. But this stuff is the \\&quot;truth\\&quot; and I plan to NEVER stop using it! I don&#x27;t care how much it costs - I will pay for it because it WORKS! Best on the market, like the other reviewer wrote - hands down!</li>
            <li> Upon the first application I noticed how light the cream is. The scent is a bit strong for me personally, but once applied the cream absorbs quickly, and the scent disappears. Within a few weeks of use I could already notice a slight difference. I am sure as I continue using Skin QR Organics – NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate my results will only get better and better!</li>
            <li> This stuff personally does not work and I barely have that much cellulite</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I&#x27;m an instant gratification person. It&#x27;s hard for me to stick to a regimen if I don&#x27;t see results fairly quick. This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and will continue to do so. Within the first three days of using, I starting noticing my skin was firmer. I love how a little amount goes a long way and I love the sample eye cream I receive with every purchase. I use this in conjunction with their scrub. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about 2 months and feel like I may be seeing some small results.  I have just purchased my second bottle and I will continue using to see if I observe continued improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, no burning effects or sensation, cream leaves a little sticky feeling after rubbing in.I wore it with some tights to help tighten back e flabby fats but have not seen any measurement improvements so far</li>
            <li> So It was like about 3 months ago that I decided to commit myself to exercising, drinking more water, eating healthier and LOOKING FOR THE BEST CREAM to get rid of cellulite....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and after trying another product for 2 months, I didn&#x27;t get any good results ....  NuElle was the next product I used and right away my skin felt amazingly soft... little by little I started seeing more and more improvements, I have to say I use it twice a day and at least once a day I massage the area using Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before even completely finishing the first bottle I ordered a second one and I will continue using this product since I am absolutely happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I am really starting to see results!</li>
            <li> I have been using #NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Firming Concentrate with 25 flub busters for 2 weeks now,  in place of my nightly lotion. The caffeine in the lotion makes a &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; effect on your skin. I can feel it working. I am pleased with it so far. I got this product free for a review. It is a huge bottle at 5oz, 150 ml. Made in USA and NOT tested on animals.  Find it here..(.www.skinqr.com)  This lotion contains a cocktail of 25 well known &amp;#34;flub Busters&amp;#34; that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction like caffeine, Butchers Broom, Bladderwrack, ivy and many others. Results can be seen in 3-4 weeks. It firms on the surface, detoxifying on the inside, reducing water retention and fat cell clusters, while improving circulation, and overall appearance of the skin.  Apply in a circular motion 2x&#x27;s a day on all effected areas such as stomach, thighs and buttocks. Use 2 hrs after a meal or one hour before. Your body will burn fat when it has none in the bloodstream. This product may cause you to sweat on the area that it was applied, thats ok, its supposed to feel that way. If it is burning in any way wash right off. Use only as directed and it is not recommended if you are pregnant. So far this is working for me. I use it before bed, and when I get up in the a.m. It is thick, and has a light smell. You can find the website here.  http://www.sweetsationtherapy.com/ Make your own decisions but I am totally happy with the #NuElle Cream so far. Good Luck to you!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream given the reviews I read on here but I have used up the whole bottle and I see ZERO change in the appearance of my cellulite.  This is just an overpriced moisturizer at best.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this post shower, and really like the moisturizing benefits. It does create a warming sensation, which lets you know the product is indeed working, but I feel I need to use it more frequently, before I notice the results I am hoping for. I also know, that I need to hydrate more than I do. This item arrived quite quickly, and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Great lotion ! I love it !</li>
            <li> I think it definitely helps with skin texture and the appearance of cellulite. The smell is strong, but not horrible. I would recommend it, I love that all the ingredients are organic!</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement...It seems to work for me</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks there has been no change as far as cellulite but my skin tone has Improved some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give no stars if I could.. Saw no results</li>
            <li> You see results in about 2 weeks. Firms up the skin and works very well. Impressive!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have been using it for approximately 2 weeks now and I see results. My cellulite on my thighs has improved better than I had expected. I will continue to use this product. I just received my second order and I am trying the scrub that goes along with this particular product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this for the last month or two. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference; however it does state it takes several weeks, so I did purchase another bottle to really give it a chance. Will let you know after the second bottle the results I see. Hopeful!</li>
            <li> I must say that I am a big skeptic when it comes to cellulite creams or any creams that promise results that are too good to be true. Although I did not believe in the claims of the manufacture, I still ordered the NuElle Triple action cellulite cream and wanted to cancel it few times before it shipped coz I was not sure if it was going to work. The product was carefully packed and the bottle was neat. To give you a background of my problem areas - I workout at least 10 hours a week and am 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and 125 lbs and wear XS tops and S size pants as my lower half is bulkier. I had 3 kids and each pregnancy has taken a toll on my body and skin, and all the stretching to Size L and then back to S has left a lot of sagging skin and jiggle on my thighs. I recently started playing tennis and could never wear the tennis skirts coz of the awkward cellulite and jiggling skin on my thighs. I even went to plastic surgeon and was almost convinced to go for lipo. Then figured that before trying out needle, I must try other things out there. I started going to bootcamps 3-4 times a week and increased my workout by 200%. While this was going on for over a month,I bought NuElle and used it the night I got it and I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE WHAT IT DID OVERNIGHT! I had to pinch myself to see if really worked. Overnight my thighs looked soft and a little firm. I just resisted the temptation to write a review right away as I wanted to see if the magic continues, thanks to my skepticism. Anyhow, I kept using it for about 10 days and I have DEFINITELY seen great results. My jiggle has gone down exponentially and my thighs seemed to be gaining their lost glory. I am working out a lot but I do not want to take the credit away from the product as the workouts could not have brought the difference overnight and definitely not the same night I started using the cream. Yes, I am gaining muscle where it was a lot of fat, but the jiggle tightened up and to me that is a magic. I would keep using until I attain the desired goal and recommend this to anyone dealing with jiggly areas :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a middle of the road score but I know the company will say I didn&#x27;t use as recommended and their correct. I used every couple of days. It does not tingle, or have that cold feeling that other firming creams have that I&#x27;ve used in the past which I enjoy, it does however have a strong smell of fruit loops! I love the smell, it is strong though.  I think the price is a bit steep and I would only buy again if I for sure followed the recommended use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since April &amp; will definitely be buying more. Actually I just bought my second bottle earlier this month because I&#x27;ve been using it so much. I like it cuz it actually works &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin slimy. I used to use another kind more but it takes forever to soak in. This kind absorbs much more quickly so I can put on pants instead of standing around forever or having my pants stuck to my legs when I stand up. I&#x27;m thin, work out 6 days a week, drink a butt ton of water, &amp; generally eat pretty healthy but I still have cellulite on the back of my thighs &amp; butt. This stuff actually helped! It&#x27;s still there but not as bad so hopefully as I continue using it it&#x27;ll go away even more. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Luv it it great product great results</li>
            <li> Love it... feels nice on skin and not messy... tightens skin</li>
            <li> I rate this a 3 because I haven&#x27;t had it for that long.  The shipping was extremely fast as well.  The other reviews say this product work....I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and have seen limited results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream a few times so I don&#x27;t have results yet but I will say that there is no strong smell. Leaves skin very moisturized (like all day!!). I haven&#x27;t experienced the &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; effect that it says may happen. So far I don&#x27;t have any negative things to say about it. I&#x27;ll update review after using the cream for a while. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I love it. I think it helps reduce the appearance of cellulite. I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product.  Love it!!! Works great, not too thick.  Was using a different product then saw this one, read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try.....so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Lemongrass...love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have not quite used the product long enough to know if it works or not, but i do love the smell, texture, absorbability &amp; natual ingredients. This is so far my fav creme &amp; i have been experimenting for years.</li>
            <li> Really good. All about consistency thou and don&#x27;t expect miracles.&lt;br /&gt;Diet and exercise are a must and I have been follwing a strict plan for fitness competitions.&lt;br /&gt;This amazing lotion is only the &amp;#34;icing&amp;#34; on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic too.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> I bought this item fair and square, full price plus shipping, no discount or incentive from this site. The cream itself is light and absorbs fairly quickly, the smell is a bit swampy but not the deal breaker. The deal breaker is that it didn&#x27;t do much for my actual cellulite, its a great moisturizer but I can get that at a much lesser price. I was not looking for miracle, a small difference would of been great, but I got no change at all.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working or not. But than months after using this product I see my stomach, legs, and arm slimming down. I apply the cream to the desire area twice a day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the scrub mitten because I am an easy bruiser. I rub myself too hard thinking the harder I scrub the better outcome will be. But that is so untrue hehehe. Anyways, I used about two of these per month. Kinda, expensive but worth it. I think it works best on people who needs to tone up their body a little. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First off let me say im one big skeptic for anything like this. HOWEVER after reading other reviews I thought I would give  it a shot, after all at the very least I would get some body lotion no matter what. It says over time you will notice improvement. I did within the FIRST night. Nothing earth shattering mind you but fewer lumps and bumps which alone was worth it there. The scent is a lemongrass type. Very refreshing but does go away. I actually use it on my face and neck too. Why not couldnt hurt. I immediately ordered another bottle. I dont leave the house without this, and I wear shorts practically year round. Nice for 5 oz too. Ive seen others half that size for the same price. What do they think we are smurfs? We need enough to see if its going to work. The added bonus is being organic. Very nice to know im not putting crap on my skin that will soak in to my body. Thank you I for one will be coming back for more. ;0)</li>
            <li> I have bought every cellulite cream on the market.. and this is no exception.. nothing works.  I even bought the scrub that goes this one.  Not one little change.  And this one has the greater misfortune to have a terrible smell to it. Smells like mildew/algae.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought it for my girl and my mom and they both loved it so much! This is a must buy</li>
            <li> didnt do anything for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle. Used it every day. Followed directions (I&#x27;m an esthetician) so know how to message. I really don&#x27;t see much difference.  My skin felt great! I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star because it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this product is!  I bought this with the Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager and my husband and I love them!  I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  I will recommend this to all my girlfriends....I&#x27;m sure their husbands will thank me!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this, I started using it twice daily after using a massage mitt on my thighs.  It has a really refreshing smell that&#x27;s very spa-like and it&#x27;s kind of amazing how soft it made my skin feel, which I was really surprised about.  I did notice a difference in the texture of my skin after about maybe 3 weeks or so.  I think it takes a strict daily regimen to see a significant result.  I purchased a second bottle because it worked so well and I want to see more results.  Also, I noticed that after I put it on, it had an interesting heating effect.  Maybe it&#x27;s the fat burning herbs?  Either way, it was doing something!  If you purchase this product, I would say give it some time with daily use and you&#x27;ll definitely see some good results.  Only thing I would say, is I would love it if the company offered a larger size.</li>
            <li> I had very minor, almost not visible on my inner thigh, but i got scared and decided to try this one, it worked for me, but i am running and working out every single day. So i think it works but u also need to workout to see the better result.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  It did absolutely nothing for me.  They state that you should eat healthy and exercise for this product to work. Which I do!  Well, they&#x27;re full of you know what.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to using Jergens or Nivea skin firming lotion. They actually make a difference and cost 1/4 of what I paid for this crap. I thought because I paid more it would work faster and have amazing results.  What a farse!</li>
            <li> I have been putting some on my stomach since I got this. this is a white cream when comes out and rather thick. It blends in fast and rubs in to a clear gel like cream. I use a cloth to put it on since, I personally don&#x27;t like to get creams like this all over my hands. It does have a scent, but not sure what - maybe lemony. Not to overpowering. I did notice the &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; effect like they said, after applying. You may not experience this but you do get a little warming in the area that you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a firming and tightening feeling after I apply this and feel like over time this product will have some benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received free full size product in order to review.</li>
            <li> Love this product.It&#x27;s organic and works wonders. I know what I am putting on my skin which actually goes into your body. With the drug store products...you have no idea what is in them and I can&#x27;t even pronounce what is in it that makes up the lotion. I&#x27;ve always found organic works better for my body.I have several autoimmunes so I have to be careful with whatever I use. I would use this product though even if I had no autoimmunes. I have tried so many other lotions and potions-none of them firm and get rid of my cellulite like this product.I highly recommend it!You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was %100 satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with this cellulite treatment cream. I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite my whole life. I had honestly given up all hope of any help or cure . But now I actually am getting back my self-confidence to show my legs off in public.Don&#x27;t get me wrong it hasn&#x27;t vanished totally (even surgery won&#x27;t do that) but its as close as you can get..Thank you and I&#x27;m very grateful.  Cheryl Wood</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my thighs for 2 months.  It has reduced the appearance of the cellulite dimples by smoothing out my skin in this area.  I have tried many products to reduce the appearance of cellulite and this one works the best for me.  I think the price value of this product is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because so many creams and lotions don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all when you apply them. However, I can definitely tell a difference in my skin after a couple of weeks using this product. It&#x27;s firming and my skin looks tighter! It also improves softness and moisture. I also work out every day and drink a lot of water, so that could help in conjunction with this product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. Works better than any other I have tried. My skin looks and feels amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li> First off – I’m not a blogger and I wasn’t paid to sample this item, but I sure wish I was! I was skeptical at my first purchase, but now I’m on bottle number four.  The lotion does have a nice warming sensation, it smells ‘spa-like,’ and spreads evenly. I’ve been using it on my thighs, stomach, arms, and ‘gobble neck’ and the best results I’ve seen are my thighs and neck. Before the lotion, the back of my thighs were dimpled and visible at all times. After using this lotion, within 4 weeks, the back of my thighs were much more smooth, very little dimpling, and only visible in certain lighting. I didn’t have cellulite on my stomach, but I can tell my stomach and love handles are less bloated – this lotion really draws out water from your body because of the caffeine in it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  The smell could be better but I can tell a difference using this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have tried everything...this product delivers! I apply once a day after I shower and it works like magic. It took 3-4 weeks to see results. I was amazed. Even my husband commented on my legs and bum. I just purchased my second bottle. No more research for me...this is THE ONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;And the cherry on top...when they ship it, it is wrapped in paper and then in bubble wrap...good quality inside and out!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the only anticellulite treatment that has actually worked. My cellulite was visibly reduced after using this product.</li>
            <li> Update after one month of use: While NuElle won&#x27;t make your cellulite magically disappear, it does have a noticeable effect after a month of use. My skin feels smoother, especially immediately after application, and it also feels tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a nice fragrance and is non-greasy. While I can&#x27;t say what its long-term effects are, it does make skin feel smoother as soon as it is applied.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually ordered a second bottle of any cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried. I really feel it helps smooth and firm my legs and also seems to draw out some of the water weight. Plus I like the smell. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This product seems to do what it claims to do! I am very impressed and looking forward to trying other products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied of this product. I just got my second bottle and I&#x27;m so excited. Awesome product!!! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I have used one bottle of this and am currently on my second one. I only use it once a day, at night before bed. Since using this, my skin feels softer and smoother, but I can&#x27;t say the dimples are completely gone. However, they do seem to be less defined. Perhaps if I used it twice a day I would see quicker results, but I&#x27;m hoping to continue seeing results with my nightly regimen.</li>
            <li> Yes this does work!!! I use it with the scrub. I lost  weight on my belly, thighs and arms in two months continuously. It doesn&#x27;t  replace healthy  eating and exercise to lose weight. It&#x27;s just to help reduce problem areas. I&#x27;ve tried many other products but none come this close where I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I think I was allergic to the ingredients. I got very itchy and red bumps after first use that continued for days...itching so bad I gave myself bruises. Tried again weeks later, to see if it would work a second time but same thing again...I tossed it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for over a year now. i usually put it on right before yoga or work-outs. i noticed it does make me sweat more during intense activity. definitely works for as long as you&#x27;re using it regularly. it tightens the skin and it also makes the skin feel softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;customer service is also great, i had an issue with one of the bottles i ordered and they replaced it right away, very friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the one drawback i have to mention is that you do have to use it everyday for best results, and the bottles are rather small for the price. i go through them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It was used as directed, but it didn&#x27;t work.  Still, the seller gave me full refund minus shipping.</li>
            <li> Great Product..Love Love Love the outcome so far..Will recommend to family and friends..Thank You</li>
            <li> I think it works. Out of all others I tried in the past year, this one so far is the best. I already see the difference. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this. It works so good!&lt;br /&gt;#NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree from #Tomoson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all natural and organic and contains 25 cellulite fighting ingredients, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states that it firms, tightens, detoxifies skin inside and out, reduces water retention, improves circulation and the look and feel of your skin, which are all common needs for the average person and this is great if it does all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 2x a day and before or after meals to burn fat. I usually use this before breakfast, when I first get up and 1 hour after dinner, or before bed.&lt;br /&gt;It will create a &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; effect to make you sweat more in areas you apply it to burn fat. It&#x27;s weird at first but after you get used to it, it is kind of Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for about a week, but I have noticed this effect and my areas that need improvement have been looking better. The Cellulite is less defined now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other creams before, cheap and expensive, but have found that this one actually works better than my other current cream. It&#x27;s light and creamy and has a kind of shininess to it that almost looks like it sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try it!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free from Tomoson but the experience and opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with an active lifestyle and healthy eating choices, I SEE a visible difference.  I have used many other creams in the past (fat girl scrub from Bliss, homemade mixtures, Nivea anti-C serum AND lotion) and I have not seen anything with results like NuElle.  It smells refreshing and it is easy to apply, within a few weeks I saw a drastic difference.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, this is my second bottle. But it has to be team work, eat healthy and exercise. I was ashamed of wearing short but not anymore. You can barely see it. I love this product, i recommend  it a 100%</li>
            <li> Yes. I loved the product. Will re order again soon</li>
            <li> Combined with Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz I have been getting amazing results.  I&#x27;ve been using this product well over a year now and can honestly say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for over a month ,once a day and it works. I  saw the difference in 2 weeks.I have tried several products before ,nothing worked like this.I think it&#x27;s a good cream.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this products actually works, it smells so much like a lemon scented cleaner (which I really don&#x27;t care for) that I won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed improvement in approximately two weeks and am happy to say that I am on my second bottle. I have used it on my arms, thighs and belly twice a day and have noticed dramatic improvement, especially in my arms; they are firmer and slender. I will continue to use this cream and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve tried a few products to get rid of my cellulite and none of them worked until now! This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 weeks ago and I can see the difference in my skin like never before. I use the lotion twice a day (morning &amp; night). I also exercise every day and I eat in a healthy way. I believe my results are  a combination of an excellent product, exercise and eating well. I highly recommend this product to everybody!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nuelle for about a month and I am definitely pleased! So far this product has worked better that any other cellulite cream I&#x27;ve tried, an I&#x27;ve tried many others. As a bonus it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, only once a day usually (not the recommended twice a day) and seeing positive results! Will def keep using...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought other products to help with my cellulite problem and saw no results, I purchased this product last spring used it as directed and noticed results within 2wks my cellulite on my buttocks/thighs are fading and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really say it works. It does make your skin feel very moist and supple. However, all the ppl saying it smells refreshing .... It&#x27;s not even close to refreshing. It&#x27;s kinda a garlic, herby smell at best. Good thing though is it doesn&#x27;t linger or get worse, by morning all sent seems to be gone. It&#x27;s certainly not a good smell like some I&#x27;ve had but not horrible and disturbing for sure. Can&#x27;t wait to see if this product does what it claims!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of anti cellulite products and this is the only one I have any faith in at all whatsoever. It&#x27;s expensive and the bottle only lasts a couple weeks when used as recommended, but it&#x27;s worth a try. Sadly I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up the usage, but I did use three bottles before my wedding/honeymoon and it DID appear to work. Stop wasting time, money, and hope on other items and give this one a try. It&#x27;s a good natural alternative also, so you can feel good about that as well.</li>
            <li> sorry did not work for me.</li>
            <li> NuElle is an amazing product. If you haven&#x27;t tried NuElle you need to. I have tried different products in the past and nothing has ever worked. But NuElle  really works I have noticed a difference in my cellulite and It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have used this as part of a daily beauty treatment after I have showered. I use it in conjuction with the New! Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager and a cellulite reduction seaweed scrub (in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed visible reduction in the cellulite especially around my thighs. I rub it in until it completely dissappears into my skin. It is easy to use and the great thing about this product is that it does more than just reduce cellulite (which after continued use) will be visible to see. It is great that I have also noticed that previously I retained water and this has helped with water retention as well. I am very pleased with this product after trying other products in the past and not having any visible help with reducing cellulite, I am happy to say that this product does work. Also the fact that it has all natural products is important to me too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazingly awesome.  Definitely got the results and more And a great deal too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works amazing and can see the results within a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will be ordering my third before I run out this time.  I might even start looking forward to the summer.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest when I say it works.  However I don&#x27;t just use this product alone because it is pricey.  With the summer months and wearing shorts and bikinis I needed extra help with the back of my thighs.  I mix this product with Nivea Skin Firming Cellulite  Concentrate Serum with Q-10 that I get at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For real results I use a dry skin brush and brush my thighs, buttocks and stomach to get rid of any dry skin and bring circulation to the skin.  Then I take 3 full pumps of this NuElle cream and 2 pumps of Nivea Gel and mix it in my hands and apply it all over my thighs, buttocks and any left over I put on my stomach.  Then I apply Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiant Skin Gradual Tan Moisturizer all over just to make sure the product gets fully absorbed on my skin.  If I am going to be wearing shorts or bikini I apply this mixture in the morning and before bed up to 2 weeks prior to wearing a bikini.  The results are good and my skin is nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products and it does not compare to this one using the application method I described above.  I am almost 40 years old and I can proudly wear short shorts and a bikini without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I did do what another person did and use it with the Avalon Organics CoQ 10 firming lotion and got lovely results. I bought more!</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 months ago. Loved the results and ran out and really saw the improvements that the product made since I ran out. It does smooth and firm up my arms and never want to be without it again. This time I ordered 2 so I can stay on top of it and not run out. Awesome product and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I just finished using  my first bottle and I was very surprise with the results.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that this cream actually helped to decrease the cellulite appearance and firm the skin on my legs and butt. I couldn&#x27;t be happier...I found that the best way to use this, it was to apply every other day using the massager and wrapping my  legs and butt with the Clear Plastic wrap ( Yes. The one you use in the kitchen for worming up stuff in the microwave..That one!)  That is actually what the use in the Spa and charge you an arm and leg... It is so much cheaper to do it at home! Put some P jams pants over and go do your house chores or waterer for about an hour . Them remove the plastic and let your skin air dry for a couple minutes before you put you close on. Anyway ..I hope this is helpful..</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. I am a competitive national bikini competitor, so I live a healthy lifestyle of exercise and perfect diets. However, I am still a woman, 38 years old, and have had a baby. Woman carry extra weight in the thigh area naturally. Now, I am not sure if this product actually does anything but, I also do not have any complaints or issues with it. I apply it like I would my lotion before bed and after my shower in the morning. It smells like lemon and is tolerable. It is not greasy. It also does not sting or burn or heat up...actually it just feels like lotion to me. I have used products in the past that heat up and turn my skin red. (Also, not sure if they do anything more or less than this one). It is kinda like a vitamin, you take it because it wont hurt you and MAY help you but, you cant prove that that vitamin actually made any difference:)&lt;br /&gt;I can be the first to say, that there really are no quick fixes:(</li>
            <li> Smells great  and left skin soft but didn&#x27;t notice any change in appearance</li>
            <li> So far so good. I see an improvement and it’s only been a couple of weeks. Smell is OK, but who cares, I like the results.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I definitely have seen results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of saggy skin on my arms which has tightened up significantly. I can actually see definition without having to flex.  My legs need a bit more work, but there has been improvement.  I&#x27;m hoping with continued use the dimpling will not be so noticeable. Maybe I&#x27;ll start using in conjunction with the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this cream is very soothing, almost like a lemongrass scent. I recommend using with some sort of skin massager for faster and better results.</li>
            <li> I have tried allot of things and I have to say this is by far the best. I went with another product not to long ago because of the reviews and though a boost would be good but I was wrong. My loyalty stays right here. Though not 100 percent gone (and I don&#x27;t expect it to be right away), I do have to admit WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Try it, buy a bottle and use it faithfully twice a day and see the difference for yourself. They ship extremely fast and its shipped proper.</li>
            <li> Have used for about 3 weeks when I go work out. The smell is not so good but seems to die down after it dries up. Works a little better than working out without it.</li>
            <li> The best anti cellulite cream so far. When I was on my first bottle, there were minor results but at least I noticed them. Now I am on my second and love it even more. It definitely works.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product. I am so happy with it that i have ordered it already twice. And I will definitely keep buying and using it. It is very important for me that products I use are organic and work. So this is a real gem!</li>
            <li> Fub stuff. I think I really like it. After a month of use, I am a believer that cellulite lotions can work.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, I researched a lot before I bought it, the ingredient list was exactly what I was looking for and being mostly organic  it  was a no brainer....this product along with sensible nutrition and exercising REALLY helps to detox  and diminish cellulite. I also drink roasted dandelion root tea for extra help with detoxing and I use a massager with this cream or dry brush before to increase absorbency and fight the stubborn areas. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This product reduced my cellulite by 70%!!!!  I was shocked!!  I had been using another well known firming cream and the results were only a modest 10 -15% improvement.  But this product, blew me away!  I ran out and ordered 3 more containers before the first one I ordered ran out!  This is a must, must, must, must have!!  Oh, and it smells lovely, absolutely lovely, a wonderful sort of fresh citrusy smell.  Make sure you read the directions though, for maximum effect.  It says you should not have any food in your system when you put it on, because it seeks out the fat in your system and dissolves it.  So if you have food in your stomach, it will probably go there instead of working on what has turned into fat.  I get up in the morning, take a shower, put the cream on, and wait one hour (which is easy because I&#x27;m fixing my hair, putting makeup on, getting dressed, etc.) then I eat breakfast.  It works FANTASTIC for me!!!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of cellulite since I was a teenager without much luck.  I am only 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and 110lbs, I work out regularly and never over indulge on goodies.  Yet still, the cellulite prevails.  I am going on a trip to Hawaii soon and plan on living in a bikini, therefore, I feel extra motivation to get rid of the dimples on my butt and thighs.  I bought this cream based on the great reviews and I am really glad I did.  I have been using it for almost three weeks, along with changing my diet and adding in extra intensity to my workouts.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Paleo, the Insanity or the cream but my guess is that it&#x27;s a combination of everything that is working.  I can actually tell that the cellulite has diminished on the back of my legs and the front of my legs appear smoother.  I would definitely recommend this product and I intend to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I already see a difference in my skin.  It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite.  I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle because I&#x27;ve witnessed amazing results. The lotions smells great and work great with L&#x27;or de la Mer body scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months already and I can see the results. Firmer skin and noticeable less cellulite. I have used several different products before and I highly recommend this lotion. It really works!!</li>
            <li> **I received a free sample for this review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week I reviewed the Skin QR Organics NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate. This product contains over 20 botanical cellulite fighting agents to help give you the best looking skin possible for your body. As time passes, this product will reduce the appearance of cellulite as it firms your skin and also helps improve your circulation throughout your body. The product is all natural and organic and is formulated to not only work on the outside of your skin but deeper into the skin layers as well. If used effectively this product can show signs within 2-3 week of change. If you are not completely satisfied with the product the company is offering a no questions asked Money Back Guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product when I first opened it smelled great and had a light texture to it when I released a small amount to try. There was a slight tingle sensation which showed the product was really working to get down into the areas where it needed to be and the product left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The key is also to continue a healthy fitness routine as well as staying hydrated to receive a maximum benefit. The product appeared to tighten skin and was easy to dispense with the pump action dispenser bottle. The cost is WELL worth the response you will get If you use it correctly. Another plus with this product is that it is not tested on animals which I believe is key in buying any form of product on the market. This is not necessary so when a company doesn’t do it, I fully support it. I did not experience any greasy residue with this product and after showering just applied it as a mere moisturizing agent and its worked great. I will definitely buy this product when I run out.</li>
            <li> It is starting to work, but 5 ounces may not be enough for me. I have years of cellulite build up. Mild smell, not offensive. I recommend using dry brush before shower and massage with body massager after applying.</li>
            <li> I rated this cream a 3 because it does a great job of making your skin super soft but I didn&#x27;t notice any other change. It has a light lemon fragrance that quickly faded away. I used it as directed until the whole bottle was gone. Definitely not a miracle cure as you may hope.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything and I am 5&#x27;8 145 pounds. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle which lasted 3 and a half weeks using it twice a day from ankles to butt. So far I&#x27;ve noticed my legs are firmer but cellulite is still very visible. It has made my skin very soft also. I&#x27;m writing this review early so I can get a free bottle, will update once I&#x27;m done with 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement with her cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am very slim, but there is cellulite dimples on my thighs and upper arms. I have tried many creams, but this one is a keeper! It smells wonderful citrusy, and the effect is noticeable within minutes of application. The orange skin look virtually vanishes! This is more noticeable on my upper arms, but it gets a lot better on the thighs too. Now I decided to put it on the area under my chin to firm the skin there as well. Happy with the results. It is a little pricey, but it works! I would like it though if they made this cream a little easier to spread. It is a bit thick.</li>
            <li> I love having a product that is organic that I can use. I like to keep buying quality products and this is a quality product. I feel and see the difference after using this cream and will continue to use it. I exercise and keep in shape but when you get past 35 it is harder to keep the elasticity in your skin tight, so this products helps with that.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products and a lot of money thrown out of the window, I finally found this product that I absolutely love so far (and it is not to pricey either). I start using it about 3 months ago and I definitely start seeing changes on my tights. And of course in order to see some results you do need to workout as well....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I do see a difference.  I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one with really noticeable results; however, I have also been training for my first half marathon, so that may be having an effect as well.  I think it is an excellent addition to any fitness regimen.  No, I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion. Love the smell. Rubs on smooth and feels great on skin.  Will use it more to see how well it works on cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have used many different creams over the years to help with my cellulite. NuElle cream worked within a few weeks and along with working out I noticed a HUGE difference in how firm my thighs were! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. I use it everyday on my stomach and thighs and within a week I can see a huge difference in the tone and cellulite .  Seller is prompt and packaging of product is wonderful. Tried another seller once, and came back to this one. Great price and product. Love that sometimes they send samples of their other products that I now buy and love!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this all of my friends. I have had laser treatments for skin tightening and this product works on the areas I cant get done.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was getting a huge result from this product because I wasn&#x27;t serving dramatic results and was eexercising more. Then I didn&#x27;t use it for a couple weeks after regular use for three months. In the two weeks, I saw more cellulite come back. I&#x27;m back on it! Its as good price, too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, and have ordered multiple bottles. I also purchased the scrub, which leaves your skin like satin. I have seen a noticeable difference after about a month of use. The fragrance is also very refreshing and light. I only wish they made it in larger quantities, and I wish they could change the design of the bottle. I prefer more of an open top so that you can scrape the insides of the bottle to get every last bit of product vs. a pump design with a top that can&#x27;t easity be removed.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this anti-cellulite cream and I&#x27;ve seen a difference! I use it 2x daily. I have, though, significantly upped my workouts and I&#x27;m sure that helps as well. If you want a little help smoothing out your skin in problem areas (mine are thighs), this product does a great job in conjunction with healthy eating and focused workouts! Will 100% buy again.</li>
            <li> It works! I have tried different products in the past, but with this one you can actually SEE the changes. Cellulite runs in my family, and after the good results I even bought one for my sister so she could try it herself.</li>
            <li> This product smells very odd.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product, I consider myself very fit, but I still have some cellulite on the back of my legs. I tried this product and so far I liked the results, is not a miracle but slowly is helping a lot to smooth my skin and to minimize my cellulite. For me is working, and I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beauty consultant at CVS and I have tried and spent alot of money on many different products throughout the years. Back in January I was recommended this product by a friend who&#x27;s been using it for a long time. I decided to give it a try and I absolutely LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed at the results. This is a product I now recommend to my clients as well as my friends!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of NuElle cellulite cream. I have tried many kinds but this one works!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is reasonable and I was surprised at how long the bottle lasted. It really seemed to firm and tone up my legs and belly. I will continue using this great product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and I can see a difference in my cellulite. It isn&#x27;t a huge difference but there is a noticeable difference. I will be buying this product again. Out of all the lotions I have used this one seems to work the best without spending a small fortune on lotions</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It actually works!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of this stuff. I really wanted to try this product based on the reviews but the &amp;#34;odd smell&amp;#34; lingers with you for the entire day.  Stopped after two weeks. No noticeable changes in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I can already see results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, products as described, hope this works!</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference, need thought id ever get rid of that stupid cellulite</li>
            <li> There is no magic bullet.  That being said, I have definitely seen an improvement with the skin on my stomach and thighs.  I have reordered and paid for a second bottle (I am not just writing a favorable review for the chance of free product), and will order more in the future.  I like the faint smell and the feel of the lotion, and it absorbs quickly. I am going to look into other products in this line, as they seem to be all natural.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference after use.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, non-greasy, soaks into the skin but not too quickly to enjoy a little massage. I like the citrus smell. After one tube it appears to firm my skin and I had to order again.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I ordered it for my daughter and I and we both have noticed amazing results! I&#x27;ve ordered more so I don&#x27;t ever run out</li>
            <li> I have used this product for months. I can tell a difference within a minutes of putting it on. The look of puckering or less-than-flattering lines goes away in minutes. I never go to the beach without first putting this product on.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first bottle of this and I don&#x27;t see any difference at all. I work out consistently and eat right and have actually started working out even harder and still no difference. I tried it bc it had comparable reviews as another cream that I had tried. That other jar of cream runs out seemingly a little faster, but I had much better results and much faster results, so I will be going back to the other cream again.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice. Moisturized ok but didn&#x27;t do anything for the cellulite. Saw no difference and eventually stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams, gels, and serums ranging from reasonably priced to very expensive. This cream has shown the best results by far! I am a repeat customer and this is part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> Just placed my second order for this product and ordered 2 this time because I hated being without it for 4 days!  It really tightens up your skin and the smell is almost intoxicating - love it.  I also love the seaweed scrub - I can tell it&#x27;s helping fade my cesarean scar which has been an added bonus!  This has become a product I can&#x27;t do without!</li>
            <li> I have clearly seen a difference in my skin!!!  I love wearing shorts now.  This cream has now become part of my daily routine!  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item a couple times now, and I think it truly does work as long as you are DILIGENT about using it everyday, or at least every other day.  Sometimes I wasn&#x27;t very consistent with the use and yet I would still see significant results!  Must try for banishing cellulite!! :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all products of this kind and I’ve tried a few, but I am pleasantly surprised. It actually works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream based on other reviews andimI&#x27;m glad I did. I never used this product line before and I&#x27;m hooked now! The anti cellulite cream has a great smell and my skin in noticeably firmer after 2 weeks!  I loved it so much I ordered another bottle to have when I finish this one.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on Amazon people said they liked the smell of this product, however when I read other reviews I saw comments about the smell being strong and unpleasant. I thought, \\&quot;How bad can it be?\\&quot; Answer: worse than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever experienced! Even my husband commented how pungent it was. I have seen some results after one tube, so I will try to deal with it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to tell a huge difference after using this product, feels nice on my skin but has a very weird smell.</li>
            <li> I have bad cellulite on my thighs and butt it has improved by at least 50 percent after 2 bottles of this cream and using it once a day. Bottles are to small and cost to much to use it twice a day. I would have gave it 5 stars if the bottles were bigger or cost less. I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I would love to put a positive review but .... after finishing two bottles I cannot report any change in my cellulite appearance. I applied it twice a day as instructed. In addition I was massaging my tights with a brush and I also exercised  3-4 times a week. I can say that I lost some weight but there is no change in the appearance of the bumps under the skin :-( I did not have much hope to start with but after reading all these positive reviews I decided to try the product. Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Use as little because its concentrated and it works great to my skin and less my weight, although i am not overweight but i have lots of cellulite on my thigh and this product make it less, definitely continued to used</li>
            <li> After seeing rave reviews for this product, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. Had better luck with Nivea.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! Within first week it makes your skin super soft! I m using it for 4 weeks now and definitely see the difference. Of course you have to use such product and exercise as well. As far this is one of the best anti cellulite products I have used. Definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, use everyday - works and smells great! Ingredients are not laden with chemicals, looking forward to trying more products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order a 3rd bottle of this cream for my girlfriend. We saw the results after about 3 weeks. So, give it some time if you are just starting to use it. I would recommend getting two bottles at a time. So, if one finishes, you can continue the application.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice now. I think the list of ingredients seems great. I noticed a small difference, but mostly reordered it because I noticed a difference when I stopped using it. I&#x27;m going to try using it for a few months to see how well that works when used regularly. I&#x27;d recommend trying it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I stopped using this as the difference was ultimately not significant enough.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. Have seen improvement in my thighs and buttocks since beginning use. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered, and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to do so. They send you a free sample with ever purchase, and a small magazine with all of their other spa products. I would definitely recommend giving this stuff a try, from ARGANIA.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  i have tried many cellulite creams and find this one to be one of the best. leaves your skin silky soft and does help diminish cellulite and tighten the skin on my thighs if used every day.  you have to be diligent and really massage it in.  i try to do twice a day, and i use one of the roller massager tools.  i think that really helps too.  what i really love though is that the product is very clean and all natural.  definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have been using if for a few weeks now and I am really seeing a difference. I see the most difference in the back of my thighs, under upper arms and neck and chin. The smell is clean and refreshing and the texture fells smooth and warm. I use this on an empty stomach right before I work out, for some reason I fell that does the best for me, since I am already burning fat while working out, why not have it consecrate on the areas the cream is. Good product and bought my second bottle so that I don&#x27;t run out before I get my replacement.</li>
            <li> Pleasant forest-like fragrance, easy absorption and along with exercise, proper diet and water intake it visibly reduces appearance of cellulite in just for weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now, and totally love it. keeps me firm and tight.</li>
            <li> I bought the NuElle anti Cellulite concentrate cream to help with my dimples in my stomach, legs and butt.  I LOVED it and bought a second bottle. It smells really good and works.  I do see a difference in my stomach and legs.  My husband and daughter have also made comments that they see a difference too. Definitely will be buying more :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 months and the results are great! The cellulite in my upper arms have significantly diminished and the measurement around the upper arm area has shrank about 1/4&amp;#34;. I also use it on my stomach area and I can tell that my pants feel looser around the waist. I do not exercise much so I know it has to be the product that is working.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review. I always read them but never write them. After reading many reviews of NuElle&#x27;s cellulite tx, I decided to give it a try. Well, that was 4 bottles ago. Clearly, I wouldn&#x27;t keep coming back to purchase if I didn&#x27;t see results. I use this in the morning and every evening before bed. At first the smell bothered me and now its fine and doesn&#x27;t even phase me. LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product! I have never used a cellulite product that actually worked and this one does.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find another product like this, this is the 3 bottle I&#x27;ve ordered! It works awesome and isn&#x27;t pricey! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th day today. I have started using this concentrate together with the massager and the coffee soap. Me and my husband were so delightful to notice a little result already the next day after only one time of using . I am not sure what exactly worked, or may be the combination, but my skin was smother and my stomach was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;About how long lasts the bottle: I noticed today that the bottle I am using is already half way through. But I am using it in my stomach, all my back, all the way up to my knees, thighs, in front of my legs from my knees and up, in the up side of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;So, seeing these results I have ordered more bottles today. Plus, I always want to put in my body, face and hair natural staff, so why not Natural and Helping to Reduce Cellulite? :)))&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this amazing product! I have noticed a huge difference on the back of my thighs after just a couple weeks of using it. .It makes my skin feels smoother and glowing!. I will continue to buy this product simply because it works!...I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife, she is using it everyday, and i have seen the results, her skin looks thighter and looks smooth..&lt;br /&gt;will keep using it</li>
            <li> This product always arrives ahead of time and is the miracle product for cellulite and improving skin firmness. With continued use 2x a day, skin tone gets better and better.  I have tried so many products and this is the only one that actually does what it says it will. Love that it is organic also.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great value.  I have ordered this product several times and it has not disappointed.  The key is to follow the directions and use regularly (twice a day).  Purchased this product and the L&#x27;or de la Mer in preparation for bikini season.  Use both products and you will definitely see results!</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and did not see any difference. I will keep looking for something else to help with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> Very bad results . Nothing! Don&#x27;t buy please. I used for 4  weeks nothing happened. Wasted my money.. Never again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for over a month. Overall I like the product.  It seem to do what it claims to...I noticed that my skin looks smoother and less rippled. And it smells great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This creme goes on very smooth and easy.  However, there is not enough significant difference for me to reorder this product.  Ladies if you have Steuben cellulite this is not an investment that you want to waste your money on.  It does not make any difference and does not slim at all.</li>
            <li> this is the only anti-cellulite cream that really works! I use it religiously 2x/day and my legs have never been smoother. I have tried everything, and I will be sticking with this cream. You can tell all the ingredients are high quality and I love that it is organic. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone trying to minimize the appearance of cellulite. I saw noticeable results after a few weeks and when I run out I&#x27;ll most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I use it religiously two times a day For two weeks straight. I&#x27;m not overweight at all I just have cellulite on my legs. i work out take care myself, This cream is just a waste of money. One good thing about it is it smells good. That&#x27;s about it no reduction. In my cellulite.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference am still using and hoping for great end results.  Very happy so far have gone through one bottle.</li>
            <li> Just started using smells great loving it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> good and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Recently purchased based upon the reviews and used the entire bottle as directed with absolutely zero results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have cellulite but this cream is awesome as a tightener agent from my perspective.It also leaves my skin ridiculously soft to the touch. Another great thing is that the size is pretty generous for what you pay. I have tons left since I only use them on my bum and things after my workout shower. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used the concentrate for several months now and i can really tell a difference when i go without applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;I generally apply it once a day, but when i remember to do the second application i can notice faster results.  If you look at your thighs and buttocks area and see unsightly dimples- this product will help!</li>
            <li> I have previously used Cellutherm (8oz) which worked well, but last time I tried to order, my security system said &amp;#34; dodgy website.&amp;#34;  This is an excellent alternative &amp; I trust Amazon.  Smells ok by me.  Use once a day after shower &amp; using cellulite massager &amp; am getting results.  Like lack of negative ingredients.  Will order 2 next time.  Wish they had decrease in price for larger orders....</li>
            <li> Ordered my 2nd bottle. great scent. ive been using it and working out. not sure how much of it is the lotion, but definitely  want to try it some more to see more results</li>
            <li> I believe this lotion actually works. There&#x27;s no magic but i did notice some improvement in my thighs and butt within the past couple of weeks of using it! Nice packaging. Love the pump - and that it dispenses the right amount. 2 pumps are enough per application and small amount goes a long way. I will buy this lotion again for maintenance.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best cellulite lotion I have come across. Nothing works 100% but use it brushing, etc and it makes a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> Rave results!! LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd or 4th order of the anti-cellulite products from Argania and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Every time I use the cream my skin looks thigher (kind of like wearing a pantyhose), I see some improvement on my cellulite specially when I use the cream every single day ( I usually only apply once a day) but if I don&#x27;t apply it, the skin looses elasticity. I love the ingredients it&#x27;s a very complete formula compared to more expensive brands; I just wish there was a bigger bottle. I really like this product, I also tried the body scrub and it is fantastic! But the cream last longer!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion 2 times already and it works for me.  The smell is awesome and my skin looks more tight.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate as part of my daily routine to get in beach ready shape. This is a light cream texture, easy to apply, fast absorbing. Creates sauna effect, warming, not tingling or burning. I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
            <li> I am actually seeing a difference I am not as regimented as twice a day and sometimes I skip a day. I have really bad cellulite. I  am 40 years old and about 20 lbs. overweight/ while I do diet an exercise I am very pale and since I don&#x27;t have darker skin my cellulite is extremely noticeable. I have been using this cream and the Finulite massager thing in  the shower and I am seeing changes my legs and arms actually are looking more toned and way, way less dimples than when I started I have only been using for about 2-3 weeks. I also have another cream but I noticed this one works way better I only used the other cream once as soon as I realized it doesn&#x27;t moisturize to the same level at all as this stuff. I just wish it came in a larger pump size because if you did use this twice a day you would need to order two bottles at a time to last only about 2-3 weeks. This product in my eyes is well worth the money and the time to really try this out</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve tried a few cellulite products with little or no results after weeks. I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful if times and I can already see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I seriously did not expect this to work. I have read so much on these creams and I just bought it because a reviewer said she used it in conjunction with \\&quot;cupping\\&quot;. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using it, and I also do the cupping, but even when I&#x27;m not doing that for a couple of days I still see way less cellulite on my stomach. I put a small amount of the cream on in the morning and at night, and I really notice a difference. It doesn&#x27;t totally remove it, but for me I think my stomach looks 50% better in the sun. I&#x27;m thrilled and will continue to buy this if I keep seeing this difference. I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that the cupping isn&#x27;t part of my results, but I&#x27;m gonna keep doing both. It&#x27;s worth the cost. I have always said that if they actually come out with a permanent cellulite cure, I will take out a second mortgage on my house to have it done. I HATE CELLULITE. By the way, the cups are on here. They are called Jar of Vacuum Cellulite Massage. Cheaper than a lot of the other cups and they work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big one but my wife and me use it for two week and nothing changed.Maybe it different from person to person.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results. I followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t see results by the time I finished the bottle.  Nice smell, moisturizes well, but I didn&#x27;t see the results I&#x27;d hoped for</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this and totally love it. I saw results within the first week. It has definitely helped with the little bit extra I needed since I am a clean eater and exercise regularly already. I have told all me girlfriends about it!</li>
            <li> Used as directed, and didn&#x27;t see any results. Hated the scent and the lotion left my legs feeling sticky. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product for firming skin and fighting bumpy cellulite areas. I have purchased it multiple times already and will continue. Great product. Makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day and it&#x27;s been weeks now, I have yet to notice any changes. I like the smell...&lt;br /&gt;Rather disappointed...</li>
            <li> This cream is kind of thick and it has a strong odor (I didn&#x27;t mind it- Kind of smells like lemons to me). The bottle says it may create a warm sensation, but I didn&#x27;t get anything like that. I work out avidly and just wanted something to help with the dimples in some problem areas. It does say to use it twice a day, but I couldn&#x27;t remember all the time, so for me just using it at night... I didn&#x27;t see much of any difference. If you aren&#x27;t going to use it twice a day, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money on this. The one perk that I did like about this was it made me feel soft for an extended period of time- but that might be just because it doesn&#x27;t absorb quick at all. It kind of just sits on the skin making it very hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> This treatment is the best hands down. I have tried it over a year ago, but had to come back to it after testing out all others in between. While I did see some minor improvement with other products, this one is superior by far. Absolutely recommend to everyone. In our era of chemical overload, being all natural is a major plus too.&lt;br /&gt;I just  received some samples of other products and very exited  to test out.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this a 4 star because I have been using this product for a while now and i see a difference in my thighs this product really works and it smells great. One thing I really like about this product is that when i put it on it makes my skin really smooth, theres no reason to dislike this it. I recommend this product to women out there who have trouble getting rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product not knowing of what kind of results to expect. Well I was totally floored by the amazing results I received from just using this product in less than 2 weeks along with using the body blaster scrub and massager. It really works! But you have to put time into doing the whole process. It&#x27;s worth it!! I love this product and will continue to use it! You have got to try it if you want those disgusting pockets to disappear from your thighs and stomach.</li>
            <li> No results after few good everything is the same</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results from this product to reduce cellulite - possibly because mine is very minor - but I have noticed a positive difference in terms of water retention and circulation.  I like to use this product before I work out in the morning... it really helps you sweat more and shed the bloat!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the cellulite scrub and roller massager (both Argania). I&#x27;m a firm believer this lotion does work! I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. I wish they sold a larger bottle, so when you order get two! I suggest to use the massager and scrub along with the lotion.</li>
            <li> After a botched slim lipo procedure a few years back I (for the first time ever) had this unsightly cellulite on my inner thighs and above my knees. I spent the previous two summers in long capri pants and bermuda shorts that covered my knees. After working out and eating right to lose more weight in hopes of getting rid of them when that didn&#x27;t work I almost gave in to getting another costly cosmetic procedure to repair the damage... until I tried NuElle. I can honestly say NuElle Triple Actions Anti Cellulite is the ONLY reason I am able to wear shorts this summer! The results showed up within a few weeks after using it twice a day but it kept getting better!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and try others that they offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with these types of products A LOT! This one beats the others for sure. Nice tightening action after only 4 weeks of use. I still see some remnants of cellulite in my hips/glutes section but I&#x27;d say about 70% gone. My belly also seems much firmer. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Came with it&#x27;s extra jar of anti aging creme opened and used already.</li>
            <li> I have use this product for several weeks and have already ordered a second bottle.  I use the lotion twice a day and I have noticed that my skin is firmer.  I decided to try the body blaster to my routine to see if the results are even greater.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products, all with the same results --- nothing! I was hoping that this product would live up to all of its positive reviews, but I sadly cannot recommend this product. (I&#x27;ve used daily for one month--zero results) BTW, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and weigh 112 lbs - have had cellulite since my late teens and workout 5x/week, eat a healthy diet but still cannot get rid of the cellulite.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working , I need to give it a little more time to really tell as it is too cold to wear shorts now. I am hoping that I will see even more results by the spring.</li>
            <li> I used this product till I finished it. I used it as instructed, and saw no difference in my appearance, still have the same amount of cellulite as before..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, even my husband noticed the difference. I used it am and pm and was in short shorts by time it was gone</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really works and feels great. It&#x27;s the best treatment I&#x27;ve used and trust me, I have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Definitely the best cellulite product I&#x27;ve used. This will be my second time buying it and I&#x27;m sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> My gf loves it. And I have seen that his really does work, we have since always been going to the gym but the cellulite was still there on her hamstrings. This has helped her a lot reducing the cellulite, of course it isn&#x27;t magical. It will only give you some help on burning those cellulite but you need to do a lot of squats, butt exercises, exercise overall and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> My legs have never looked better! Ill admit I had some questionable looking areas under my buttocks and on my thighs, a little rippled shall we say?, yikes! But this product has definitely made an improvement, along with the massager which I love!!! And the smoothing body scrub I can honestly say I have found what works for me! My skin is so much silkier and smoother as well! No more dry patchy spots on my legs and its organic! That&#x27;s an A+ in my book!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I exercise a few days a week but I was still having issues with cellulite. After a couple weeks of using this lotion twice a day I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking much better! It even smells good!</li>
            <li> This product is great. You don&#x27;t need much. It spreads well and leave my skin feeling hydrated and look smooth. Over time I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appreance of cellulite. It gradually shrinking and this product has changed the texture of my skin.  It&#x27;s tightened.</li>
            <li> gives amazing soft skin, i really enjoy!not to sure how much it helped with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my wife, and it works effectively on her skin problem. I will recommend this product to my friends who have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased NuElle Cellulite cream twice for a reason, and will continue to purchase once every 3 months.  After you shower, and when you dry off, you want to rub the concentrate on your tummy, bum, and thighs. It smells pretty decent and it does tighten the skin well! You&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
            <li> Love the product! I see and feel the results and not to mention, great scent!</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference. There was a product I tried before that worked much better.  This did not absorb well, and no difference.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting this to work but it does the trick. I do some dry brushing before hand to make sure it penetrates well. I also like that it&#x27;s all natural and is chalked full of ingredients. Makes me feel like I am getting a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to try a bottle of Skin QR Organics NuElle Anti-cellulite Firming Concentrate for free through a promotion. It comes in a 5 oz. bottle with a pump for dispensing, and contains &amp;#34;25 Flub Busters&amp;#34;. Directions say to rub into affected areas with a circular motion twice daily. This does cause a warming sensation and the area does sweat while it&#x27;s working. I did notice firmer skin after a few days, but better results will hopefully be shown after weeks of continuous usage.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product.  I use it on my upper legs to tighten and smooth them.  I can definitely see a difference after about 3 wks.  I realize, in order to keep the results, I will have to continue using it everyday.  I have no problem with that, as it takes 10 seconds to rub it on both legs simultaneously, and actually smells great.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I began using this product about 3 months ago and unlike all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this definitely reduced the appearance of my cellulite (plus it&#x27;s organic and smells awesome too!).  When my daughter was home for spring break last week, I was wearing shorts and it was the first thing she noticed - she exclaimed &amp;#34;Wow! Mom! You can barely see your cellulite!!&amp;#34;  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because, like other reviewers, I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> OMG, the first time that I bought this I was a little bit skeptical, however I read the reviews and I thought I had to give a chance. After being using this product for over a month I can certainly say I&#x27;ve seen the results. Of course like everything you have to help the product having a good diet and doing some exercise. Even my husband noticed the huge difference. I would continue buying this product and recommending it. I highly recommend the vendor too. Product came fast even though is not prime.</li>
            <li> This product works. Buy it right now, I just ordered my second bottle. I could not be more pleased. I was hesitant as well, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this product. Like most cellulite creams, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working but I&#x27;m willing to try longer. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I&#x27;m now on my third bottle and think I will continue using.  Still smells clean and not too strong after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried at least 5 other products like this and really like the pump design.  The company really appears to be excellent with customer service.</li>
            <li> After two bottles I don&#x27;t se any results !!!! Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Before this I never believed that cellulite creams could possibly work. But have always been frustrated that no matter how in shape I get, there is always this little bit of cellulite that just never goes away. Well, a friend gave me some about a month ago to try (after I was lamenting about this to her), and I have been using it daily ever since...I just ordered a second bottle! First of all, as other reviewers have mentioned, it smells really nice. It has a very subtle, pleasant scent, sort of like a very mild green tea-like fragrance, but not overpowering at all like some green tea perfumes. I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, but it is sooo nice, and I know it is natural because of the brand. It is also very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion. Once it soaks in, it does feel slightly tacky to the touch, but that is a small thing compared to the benefits and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, after only a week or so of using it twice daily (most days- I forgot in the morning a couple of times), I had already noticed the skin on my stomach looking so much smoother! It took a little longer for my thighs and behind, but there was more work to do there...LOL...but after a month, I absolutely did see a difference there, too. So, I will keep it up and report back in a month or two on the progress! I trust that it will continue. THANK YOU NUELLE!</li>
            <li> I did not see any results after using this product. I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe cellulite is curable, but this product works... surprisingly well! The skin definitely looks more smooth, firm and elastic. I am buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> Just finished an entire bottle to give it the benefit of the doubt and used it religously even exfoliatimg daily and using a derm roller.  I took before/after pics to test the product.. but there has been ABSOLUTELY NO IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER.  I was using cocoa butter and nivea ultra concentrated serum before this and was starting to see some noticeable results so decided to spend a little more and buy this.  Absolitely no results whatsoever with nuelle... in fact I have some worsening now because I stopped the nivea while using this.  As before, I continue to go to the gym, drink tons of water and eat healthy so everything has been consistent except the product used.  $3 cocoa butter and $10 nivea gel works MUCH MUCH better and costs much less so learn from me and save your money!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. It is very smooth and leaves my skin very hydrated. I use everyday and I think that it is the best that I have bought.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so much that can be done against the forces of time but this product really helps. With other recent efforts I&#x27;ve lost almost 10 lbs over the last 3 months and this product has worked to reduce cellulite and keep up with slackening skin. I still want to see more improvement but husband saw a notable difference in as little as 3 wks time, using once a day (with a massager). Luv it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!! I have tried EVERY cream out there, but this is&lt;br /&gt;the only one I have ever seen any results with. It hasn&#x27;t completely erased&lt;br /&gt;my cellulite, but the appearance is greatly improved! My skin is so much&lt;br /&gt;firmer and has a smoother appearance since I began using this. And if I run&lt;br /&gt;out, I can definitely tell the difference after not using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Okay so I just started my second bottle of the Nuelle cellulite cream and on my 4th week of using it and I must say....It gets better with time. I originally ordered the set with the scrub and massager. I have now noticed a bigger improvement since I first reviewed the set. Thighs are slimming down a lil more and the cellulite appearance are reduced some and skin does feel firmer. I didnt believe that anything would work before trying this product. Now I am a true believer of Nuelle. I will now use it on my stomach and waist area  and see what kind of results I will get. Will update in a couple weeks or so. Oh also my skin has never felt so soft and silky. I love It!</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this product. It has many ingredients which are proven to help eliminate the appearance of cellulite and I think when used daily it does the job :) I will be purchasing again, thank you sellers!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the cellulite part yet put I do feel as if I&#x27;m losing water weight using it on my hips thighs and stomach</li>
            <li> Did not work! Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the best for cellulite and I tried them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost over a hundred pounds in that last 4 years, and I&#x27;ve got a lot of loose hanging skin that I wanted to try to firm up especially in my thigh area.  I&#x27;ve noticed a change in that some of my loose skin is appearing firmer in my abdominal area as well as my thighs.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a smoother appearance on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> Bought this twice. It&#x27;s that effective. Use the scrub in the shower and this morning and night!</li>
            <li> I am a figure competitor who is in very good shape.  In off season I am about 15% body fat and in season I go down to 7% body fat but I have cellulite no matter how lean I am.  I was sooooo excited when I read all the reviews about how this worked for people who were athletic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product until the bottle was empty. I used it just as directed, 2 times per day.  2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal (easy for me because I eat 6 meals per day, every 3 hours).  Unfortunately, I did not see any change in the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I used two different brands of anti-cellulite products immediately after the other and this product from Skin QR Organics worked better for me; the other product made my eczema flare up and this did not. I really like this brand so much I am going to try another item from Skin QR Organics!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for a while but in the first week I could see a huge difference in my skin, I want to keep using it forever.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with cellulite since I was a teen. I have tried many things, but recently I found this product and liked the organic and natural ingredients, so I thought about giving it a try. So far I have used 3 bottles, and after the second one, I really started noticing a difference. I am very pleased, as cellulite can be very stubborn, and I will likely recommend this product to any woman with cellulite.</li>
            <li> the smell makes me crinkle my nose.. it is not gross, but over whelming at times.. really don&#x27;t see an improvement at all</li>
            <li> I use this product every day as part of my daily routine.  It&#x27;s affordable, clean, and non-greasy.  I noticed a difference in  my tone and it appears to be making a difference!  I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been only using this for a few days but am already noticing a difference! So far love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few other products since trying this one.  This one by far, works the very best.  And it smells pleasant too!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It really does diminish the appearance of cellulite, results can be seen after about 3 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> Skin QR Organics sent me this Anti Cellulite Concentrate to review for my GlamRiver blog and I was really excited to try it out since I am a huge skeptic and I know a cream cannot get rid of cellulite.  I have been using the cream as directed for several weeks now and while I can&#x27;t say my Cellulite is gone I will say that while using the cream my skin DID look and feel more smooth.  So for the appearance of skin that looks &amp; feels smoother this product is an excellence choice!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product. I think what&#x27;s most important is that the product does what it claims to do. I noticed the difference day 3-4 of my treatment. I normaly use it once a day after the shower sometimes twice. I think the skin is more responsive after a bath or shower to the active ingredients. I like to put a thicker layer, let it dry and then put on cotton leggings for better results. The application is easy and clean. I love it! I also have their body scrub which I try to use one a week. This one smells exceptional! You should definitely try both if you can because the skin feels really refreshed after using it. The product itself just seems so healthy, organic and natural. On top of it the price is very good, it comes in a discrete packaging and it is super well protected so you can be sure you won&#x27;t be receiving a broken bottle. I did not do any special exercise or diet, I actually stopped going to the gym for some time and still saw great results. I can recommend this product to someone with a moderate cellulite because that what I use it for and it works. For deeper dimples you will notice them being diminished but still present. If you are are struggling with advanced cellulite, go ahead and use the cream it will still work to your advantage. And I feel you should do more research and take more action on top of it. For 100% results it will take100% of hard work and dedication, not just a magic cream.  I saw some very interesting before and after of women who totally transformed their bodies. Exercise, diet, massages and healthy life style will pay you off greatly. This is my next step:) don&#x27;t be lazy, join me:)</li>
            <li> Would not buy again don&#x27;t like the smell and it&#x27;s hard to wash off. Did not see any results.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of cellulite, my diet is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; no processed foods and I do some form of exercise daily. Since menopause I notice some on my inner thighs. I do notice a difference when I use this product, my thigh looks toned and the skin is smooth and taut. The caffeine seems to flush out excess water weight. Give this a try you have nothing to lose except some cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was a little less expensive, but let&#x27;s face it the best products cost more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a couple years and can really tell a difference when I am using it. Not only is it great for skin firming/ anti-cellulite purposes, but it is also an awesome lotion. The scent is great and it absorbs well. It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I do not know this concentrate work or not for cellulite but I use this product  almost 7 days and I like  it  a lot.  Skin feels smoother and nore soft.</li>
            <li> It is pretty natural for women to have cellulite and it is such a hot topic among women. Everyone wants to get rid of it and try to find the ways to do so. I remember when I was at school my aunt was in direct sales and was introducing women beauty items, and that time she told me that her anti-cellulite products were her best sellers. That time I did not pay much attention to it, but years passed, a baby appeared in our family and all those cellulite spots became obvious. To get rid of cellulite is not that easy as it seems, it needs discipline, regular exercises and a quality skincare. While exercises can bring significant upgrades to cellulite areas, I know that I should consider the right and effective products for my skin. Anti-Cellulite sounds like a magic to me. How amazing to have a smooth, tight skin and proudly wear your swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate from Skin QR Organics. This fantastic product contains a working combination of 25 well known flub busters to help in weight loss and reduce cellulite. I like that this organic concentrate is intended to firm the surface of the skin and go deeply to reduce fat cell clusters and water retention at the same time. I’ve been using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for a few weeks and I like the results, I like how my skin becomes firm and smooth. It should be used twice a day what was the most was challenging, apply on thighs, buttocks and stomach every day, no matter if you are tired or busy. Visible results are not going to appear in a few days but I was happy I am doing the right thing in my fight with cellulite. I like the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate citrus smell, light and pleasant. I really want that all beauty products were the quality of Skin QR Organics. Overall, I think NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate brings pretty much all the results it claims.</li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to review a bottle of NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate. I didn&#x27;t have a ton of cellulite before I started using it but there was enough there to make me self conscious about it. After using the product for three weeks, I could definitely see results. My skin was firmer and the cellulite was reduced. Pictures can be seen on my blog. It is hard to see the cellulite in the first picture but it is there. I didn&#x27;t even use this every single day or even twice a day as directed. But I still got results that I was happy with. Even my skin texture was improved! I know when spring comes, I will definitely remember this product and order a bottle because I will need it. I always gain a few extra pounds over the winter and need to work harder to bounce back in the spring. I would definitely recommend NuElle to anyone looking for a cellulite reducing cream that works quickly.</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate contains a cocktail of 25 well known flub busters that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction! Ingredients like caffeine, L&#x27;Carnitine, Butcher&#x27;s Broom, Bladderwrack, Ivy and many others are proven work both on the surface and in depth to help you lose weight and reduce the appearance of cellulite! You can actually see results in 2-3 weeks! As you can see on my blog, I had really great results! You can even see how my jeans were pushed out but now they are flat! I wore the same pair of jeans for the purpose of my before and after! I even think it helped smooth out my stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I was very surprised by my results! I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I do see a difference! I used this product on my stomach and my thighs. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my thighs by just looking but I do see a huge difference in my stomach! Even my jeans seem to be fitting better. When applying I rub on in circular motions 2 hours before breakfast and 2 hours before dinner. When you apply it, you can definitely feel the warming of the product. It doesn&#x27;t burn but it almost feels like you have a warm heating blanket on! This is definitely a great product to help you break down some unwanted cellulite or help you aide in your weight loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a product to review. Regardless, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Although I see very good ratings below, I have to say that this product did not work for me at all. It also has a very strange odor that made me gag. It smells horrible. I will not buy this cream again I feel that it was not a good investment of my money. It did not help me at all. I do not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs every day after I get out of the shower. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft without leaving it sticky. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent (in fact it seems like there is no scent added). This is so great.</li>
            <li> not sure if it really reduced cellulite, but you can feel how smooth the skin is! Big difference! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but did nothing for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a cellulite cream that is gentle, no heat sensation and yet effective on my skin. I was reading the customer reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  So glad that I did, this cream works great and I had NO skin irritation.  See firmer thigh and less cellulite after one week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this cellulite cream, and have noticed a major difference in the quality of my skin on my thighs and butt! Definitely smoothing out!! Yay! Also, I love the fact that it&#x27;s full of high quality organic ingredients as well! I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this product line is the best I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> This came so fast and I love it! It smells amazing and so far I have noticed the back of my legs are way firmer and any small cellulite is definitely reducing in appearance! I&#x27;m so buying another bottle when I run out and I really want to get the body wash so that is on my holiday wish list!</li>
            <li> After six weeks of forced inactivity with a broken leg, I was left with some excess fat and visible cellulite on my thighs and bottom. When Sweetsation Therapy asked me to try out some of their products, I mentioned my dilemma and they very kindly sent me this anti-cellulite cream and the L&#x27;Or de la Mer scrub. To my delight, the combo really helped and I saw encouraging results in a relatively short time (three weeks). The visible cellulite (giving that awful “orange skin” appearance) has almost disappeared and I have to squeeze my flesh to see any little unevenness. I don&#x27;t have time to be more pro-active but I have been using the scrub every second day and the cream every evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube comes with a handy pump and I find that three pumps are enough to cover each thigh and buttock. Unlike other gels I have used in the past, this product is a thick, silky cream that allows a fairly lengthy massage before being absorbed completely (that in itself provides half the benefit). The scent is not great (like macerating herbs) but it doesn&#x27;t linger and the quantity of cream I&#x27;m using disappears completely without staining my clothes. There is an impressive list of all-natural ingredients which includes all the most effective anti-cellulite and circulation boosting extracts I&#x27;m familiar with. I know from past experience that caffeine and seaweed extracts work for me, but I had never seen a product with so many essential oils (juniper, cinnamon, cayenne and wintergreen oils are all great for enhancing blood circulation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treating cellulite is an ongoing process, meaning I&#x27;ll have to continue using something to keep the monster at bay, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found two new products that work so well for me and at pretty reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s gotta be something excellent about this product that keeps me continually buying more!  I want to swim in it.  I WISSSHHH they made a larger size :( .  I&#x27;m not the most consistent user and I should be because I love it so much, but I use it as often as I use any of my beloved &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products and this has definitely become one of them.  I love the ingredients.  I am so picky when it comes to moisturizers…I&#x27;m a real brat about them because I just simply don&#x27;t like most--I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to reduce the appearance of cellulite - creams, lotions, rollers, procedures, you name it.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, has worked as effectively as this stuff.  I literally cannot believe how much this reduces the appearance of cellulite!  This is a MUST for anyone who has ever been self-conscious about cellulite.  I follow the directions, and the dimples on the front of my thighs disappear.  I will never wear shorts or a swimsuit without this on my legs ever again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it! Most products haven&#x27;t worked in the past but this one does REALLY WORK! I&#x27;m officially ready for vacation!</li>
            <li> NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate really works!!! I have tried many other anti cellulite creams that don&#x27;t work!! This is the first product that I actually saw results within the first few weeks!!!! I rated it 5 stars because it does everything that it promises!!! I will continue buying NuElle Anti Cellulite Concentrate and I would recommend it to anyone that has some cellulite and wants to firm up some stubborn areas!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and smells wonderful! I wish I had taken a before and after photo, but I can tell the back of my thighs are definitely smoother. I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my stomach but after reading what others have said here, I think I will start. The price is right for this considering that it goes a long way and shows results!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks with a combination of light cardio and I saw immediate results. I use to work out a lot more and I still had some cellulite on the back of my legs. Recently I broke my leg and was unable to bare weight on my leg so I lost my muscle and developed what looked like a bag full of cellulite. Once I was cleared to work out (3 months later) I was obsessed with getting the cellulite under control. I bought this product and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results, it not only helped but my legs look better than before I had my injury. The cellulite is pretty much gone.  2 weeks and I applied it morning and night, 5x a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but none has given me the results as fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks and I see a big difference on my skin like never before.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome is the second bottle I ordered and for sure is working I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month and I&#x27;m starting to see little differences so the more I use this I guess it would be better I totally recommend</li>
            <li> This product has not performed at all for me.  I had to go back to my 3d product that really gave me that look and confidence after 15yrs to wear shorts again.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it daily over a month and I have definitely seen improvement. My skin feels more soft and much smoother. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> Feels nice.  Seems to have improved skin texture somewhat.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture and it feels good on my skin. I think it&#x27;s working but just like with anything you do, even plastic surgery, you must change your lifestyle as in eating healthy and working out...&lt;br /&gt;I say go for it and it will help you to improve your tone and firmness unless you just not take care of yourself...this is my opinion</li>
            <li> This product works great. The appearance my cellulite deminished by 50%. It works way better than other creams I have tried. The only reason I did not give the product 5 stars was because the lotion smells awful. The smell does not last long, it is only stinky when you initally put the lotion on. Other than that I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> After having tried many other anti-cellulite lotions on the market, I can say  unequivocally that this anti-cellulite concentrate has the most popular anti-cellulite ingredients in a natural formulation that works very well at reducing the appearance of cellulite. Although I am within a healthy weight I have had cellulite in my legs since age 12... and nothing has worked until now. I have been using this lotion in combination with the scrub and massager of the same brand and was able to see results within a week of using them (applying every night after a shower). I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been \\&quot;eating right\\&quot; and exercising regularly for almost 15 years (I&#x27;m 33 now). I began using firming lotions in the beginning of 2010, twice a day, every day, in an effort to get rid of some stubborn inches around my torso left over from the years of less than stellar eating. I&#x27;ve never been more than 20 lbs over weight nor have I ever had a problem with cellulite. Recently I switched the lotions I was using to the all-natural/ organic type lotions to avoid unwanted preservatives and the like. I&#x27;m really glad I did, as the new choices work much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe getting up and rubbing my torso vigorously as I apply the lotion would have its own steady effect; that light exercise raises the body temperature, affecting metabolism and the rubbing also increases blood flow to the area. A caffeinated lotion also has the immediate effect of slimming by reducing water volume in the applied area. That being said, it does seem that the ingredients in some firming lotions, including this one, do promote a firming of loose skin and accelerate subcutaneous fat loss more so than a standard moisturizing lotion would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Nuelle in the morning and use Avalon Organics Ultimate Firming Body Lotion in the evening. I do this to \\&quot;mix it up,\\&quot; as the products have different ingredients, and to keep the costs down. The other reason I apply this in the morning is because it is really quite heavy; on one hand my (male) skin stays unbelievable soft, even 8-12 hours later when I apply the other, more absorbent lotion. On the other hand, it can feel tacky against form fitting clothes, like boxer-briefs, or the underarms until it absorbs. I would imagine absorbability is faster and the product&#x27;s extreme \\&quot;silkiness\\&quot; is better tolerated with female&#x27;s skin than males. The Nuelle cream has a lemon-citrus smell, which I rather enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never \\&quot;treated\\&quot; the area before, the results really popped at first, with me seeing a good deal of tightening within the first three months; the rest of my results happened gradually, sometimes in bursts (at times it would seem like there was some lag between the fat-loss and the firming, giving a small intermediate period of sagging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just over two years of applying the firming lotions the results are amazing! I never set out to lose pounds, I just wanted to get the lower abs and the oblique ridge [a friend of mine calls it, \\&quot;the porn cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out. I&#x27;m not altogether there yet, but I&#x27;m so close to having a fitness model&#x27;s body. I would never have thought it&#x27;d be possible for me to appear so lean, I&#x27;ve gained more definition in the last two years than I had in the previous seven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side-note: I also apply the lotions to my face and neck with fantastic results. As is a problem for many fit males, I had deep smile parentheses that have all but vanished by now, leaving a far more rested and youthful appearance. I have also applied around the eyes to some effect but a dedicated caffeine based eye-cream works much better. No need to worry about the lotion \\&quot;going too far,\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used the firming lotions for 2+ years and my hands and face haven&#x27;t left me looking like Skeletor. Much Peace!hin the first three months; the rest of my results happened gradually, sometimes in bursts (at times it would seem like there was some lag between the fat-loss and the firming, giving a small intermediate period of sagging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just over two years of applying the firming lotions the results are amazing! I never set out to lose pounds, I just wanted to get the lower abs and the oblique ridge [a friend of mine calls it, \\&quot;the porn cut\\&quot; ;)] to pop out.

            <li> Excellent product, I am already seeing a difference in my skin...softer &amp; smoother. I will definitely be re-ordering soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half and IT WORKS!!! I have tried EVERYTHING for cellulite - this stuff works - and very well. I use it every morning after my shower. I also use the scrub in the shower. It is super refreshing and smells great. I bought the roller as well - it feels great at the end of the day and I use it on my outter thighs at nioght while watching tv. I have ordered the lotion 3 times now and will continue to do so!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this NuElle Triple Action Anti celluite concentrate I was so excited to receive it in the mail!! First I wasn&#x27;t sure it  that this would work as I have never tried this type of product before  but when I received it &amp; used it  I noticed a noticeably difference after using the product!! I love that this product is all natural and made with organic ingredients!! This product is said to improves circulation &amp;  reduces the appearance of cellulite overtime while Firming &amp; detoxifying which after trying this product myself I feel this product does a great job of doing what its suppose to do!!  would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am now ordering my third bottle for this.  It is not a cure-all for cellulite but no product can be.  I can definitely tell a difference when I use it however.  It does help firm up the skin which in turn helps with a more active lifestyle and being more conscious of what I eat.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will help you out with your confidence this product can definitely help at a decent price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW MONTHS AND I&#x27;LL KEEP BUYING IT FOR TWO REASONS.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST, IT MAKES MY SKIN AMAZINGLY SOFT.IT&#x27;S THE BEST CREAM I&#x27;VE EVER USED!&lt;br /&gt;SECOND,I SEE THE DIFFERENCE WITH MY CELLULITE,I&#x27;D SAY AFTER 6 BOTTLES MY CELLULITE IS REDUCED BY ABOUT 30%.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING, BUT IT WORKS. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Pump bottle is high quality, easy to disoense.&lt;br /&gt;nice feel, smell&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use consistently enough to determine results but high quality ingredients packaged nicely that will keep ingredients stable</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for the first time and I didn&#x27;t see any results using it.  I tried it because of all the good reviews it got; but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying another different one, soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I just purchased this item not too long ago, using the cream every day, and seeing minimal results already. Can&#x27;t wait to see more in the next few weeks! Great size bottle and just a small quarter size amount does the trick. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about literally every product Ive used from these folks. This product in particular Im using for my 2nd time around along with their skin firming cream and its a delight to put on i look forward to it after the shower or before bed, i massage problem areas very firmly and I do see results. I exercise on a daily basis but that singularly does not take cellulite away. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed a difference in the appearance for my legs.  Great product, will use again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works long term - not sure but it does make a difference! I used it on my puffy eye area under my brows and it worked. Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I got the first bottle as a trial from a friend, loved it so much that I bought a second; saw a smoother appearance in just a few days. The cream gives your skin a &amp;#34;pump,&amp;#34; so your dimples look much less noticeable even just after the first use. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now in conjunction with the L&#x27;or De La Mer Organic Cellulite Blaster. I love them both! I have used SO many products that claim to work, but I have never noticed results like this before. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It works amazing. I purchased one to try, based on all the glowing reviews and would have to second them. This stuff works. I am almost at the end of my first bottle and repurchasing another now. I am a regular shape woman size 6, but have a few areas that need extra attention, like back of my legs and sides of my knees. I try to exercise at least 3 times a week and eat healthy. All in all, celulite is not yet a primary nagging problem, but I like to be proactive. Ever since I started using it, those areas that stopped responding to exercise visibly improved. All I did was massaging them with lotion and use their cellulite scrub in the shower, which is great by the way. Sounds simple, but it helps.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective product to reduce cellulite. I have tried everything: creams, lasers, massagers and everything left me disappointed. This cream delivers exactly what it promises, it firms your skin and reduces the appearance of cellulite. I have been using it for 4 months now and I use it only in the morning. My cellulite is almost gone, and I am over 30 years old. I exercise every day and I am sure that helps too, but I have always been active and no other product left me as satisfied as this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and absorbs fast. You will notice some firming right after using it, but this only lasts for a few hours. I have had a better outcome with their seaweed scrub.</li>
            <li> i do not like the smell</li>
            <li> doens&#x27;t do anything it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I have used several other lotions that supposedly reduce cellulite but I never noticed a difference. After reading reviews of NuElle, I decided to try it...and I noticed a difference within weeks. My skin felt tighter, and there was definitely a reduction in cellulite. Even my sister made a comment that my legs looks significantly smoother. I use this every day, once or twice a day. I&#x27;ve had problems with cellulite for my entire life, even when I am in great shape, and this is the only product that has worked. I honestly feel like I&#x27;ll never stop purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for the last year or so, and it&#x27;s delivered some great results. My skin feels incredibly soft, supple, and smooth. I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite to begin with, but I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my stretch marks have started fading. The scent is not too overpowering…it smells faintly of baby powder, which I don&#x27;t mind at all. Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best cellulite products on the market, and for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Cellulite has never been something pleasant to look at or have – so I do what I can to prevent it from plaguing me too much! I use it in the shower and it has been working like a charm for me! It doesn’t take long to see results too…and I must say that it is worth checking out and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-cellulite creams (including the \\&quot;the best seller\\&quot; finulite... what a scam!!) for quite a while, and Nuelle by far is my favorite!!! I have been using this product for a year already and the appearance of the skin in my thighs has improved a lot. Not only it is made just with NATURAL ingredients but also has the perfect consistency to perform a good massage in my problem areas. .... and by the way SMELLS GREAT and the PRICE IS UNBEATABLE for the benefits that provide. I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She&#x27;s on her second bottle and will continue to buy. This stuff really works and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best anti-cellulite creams I&#x27;ve used - at a far lower price than the ones from the \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; counters at the big name stores.  I love that it has a creamy but not oily feel, so I can use it right after the shower and not be afraid to have to wait until it soaks in (like some other AC products) and I can put my clothes on right away (since time is always short in the mornings).  It took awhile before I saw results (but what doesn&#x27;t?) and I&#x27;m encouraged to see improvements, little by little.  Stick with it.  I know there are lots of other similar products like this one out there, but this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with, along with the body scrub.  I think the combination of the 2 are what has really started making the difference.  I, for one, will keep buying this over, and over, and over...</li>
            <li> Cellulite isn’t a pretty thing, my friends. But most of us deal with it, so what are we supposed to do about it? Currently, we’re testing the NuElle Anti Cellulite Concentrate to see how good of a job it does on the “flub”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tall bottle that blends in well on my bathroom counter top with my other products LOL! You remove the clear plastic lid, press the button and squirt a little on your fingertips. Then you rub it into the area you want to treat and that’s it! That’s the whole process!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a ton of natural ingredients, like caffeine, flower extracts, herbs and vitamins. The company says the combination of these ingredients will reduce the appearance of cellulite within 2-3 weeks for most users. It’s suggested to be used on areas like your arms, belly, thighs and buttocks, wherever you want to treat the “flub” as they call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about the sauna effect that you might feel after applying the cream to your skin. I felt a little tingling, but nothing that slowed me down or made me not want to use it again. For me, the odor was strong…not unpleasant, but I’d hate to lather it all over me before sitting close to someone. Definitely just my personal opinion, it didn’t bother everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how long this bottle would last you, I’d say it depends on how much you’re using and how much area you’re covering. I think a little goes a long way and it did spread nicely on the skin. I’ll update this post with my results once they are in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Hmm didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I do believe I wasted my money but then most experiments are a hit or a miss so I guess this one was a miss.</li>
            <li> im a workout diet kind of girl, still have cellulites...and tried everithing out there. this work for me,my cellulites are visible less after my second botlhe, i recomend this cream, defynily deserve a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I love it, smells nice and does the perfect job! I recommend this product even if you dont have problem with cellulite, makes skin so firm:-)</li>
            <li> use the scrub and cream..it work for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now (once a day, two hours after dinner). I run out of my first bottle and ordered a new one that was delivered on Friday. It seems to be working very well. It is not magic! But it is working. Of course, I believe you should also complement the cream with some exercise and/or a kind of healthy diet to help the product work better. I will use this bottle twice a day, and I hope to receive even better results. Truly recommend it. I have tried two other products of lesser value, used them exactly as was indicated in the bottles, and they didn&#x27;t really do anything for me (Jergens Skin Firming and Nivea Body Good-bye Cellulite). Therefore, I recommend you pay a higher price for this product because it is worth it. It works and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li> The best product ever. I&#x27;ve tried Nivea, Bliss and everything else out there and have to claim that this is the best stuff by miles. Still not a lypo overnight, but I am not expecting that. Amazing results within a short time period. I am sure it will continue delivering with continuous use.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell. I drink water all day and have been working out- I dont see that this product has made ANY difference. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product only moisturized my skin, did not tighten it, nor did it tingle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 9/3/2014- I meant to say warming, spa effect, not tingle. I changed this from a 3 star to a one star because the company contacted me, trying to bully me into giving them a higher rating. I got this product free via tomoson.com, but I WILL NOT let that affect the integrity of this review.</li>
            <li> I am seeing my middle, love handles and stomach a bit flatter.&lt;br /&gt;But my thighs are stubborn so I need lots more work with them.&lt;br /&gt;I use the massage item sometimes on my thighs plus the difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;It is my first bottle so I will give myself more time after the second bottle where the thighs are concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But the cap keeps popping up with the spring and its so annoying because it takes 5 to 10 minutes to get it working.&lt;br /&gt;If the caps not on well the cream will not be released.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid that it will soon not function and I will not be able to finish the bottle and that will be a even bigger disappointment because I spent my hard earned cash for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:After contacting the suppliers concerning the cap problem, I received top service and a new product was sent to me asap. I am also seeing more results on my middle and thighs so I will continue with this product and I&#x27;d like to also try out other products under this brand-name.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second bottle.  While it&#x27;s too soon to tell how effective it will be, I can say that the cream is pleasantly fragranced  (it reminds me of lemonheads candy) and it absorbs nicely. I use three pumps daily after my shower.  I also make sure I exfoliate my skin in the shower because I feel that the cream absorbs better that way.  My skin is a bit tacky for a little bit after applying but that goes away and it does not stain clothing.  I feel like my skin is getting tighter.  My order came quickly the first time, a bit longer the second time but it was the holiday season so that is understandable.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite from Amazon to date.  I was looking for a cream that went on smooth, did not smell horrible and did the job.  This product does it all and I will not be without it.  I have ordered 3 so far! You will not be disappointed.  The only downside is that it is a bit expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long for me as I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different creams and really loved this one. I switched to a different highly rated brand and it was so bad. I wish I had never spent money on other cellulite creams. This is by far the best! I&#x27;m on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Sure there is some noticeable improvement but with the eating regimen(use  2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal) you have to follow with this product I can see how it may work.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again, will just exercise more, cut out a lot of carbs and massage tush/thigh area with a massage mitt.</li>
            <li> The lotion will give you a firm skin feeling after you apply it. I don&#x27;t like the smell though. That&#x27;s why i gave 4 star but im getting used to the smell now so it&#x27;s not that bad. I use it everyday, 2x a day with a massager. Just ordered my 2nd bottle!! I haven&#x27;t see a huge result yet, but im getting there.You Just have to continue Using it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product that I have come to really enjoy. It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy or with a funky viscosity. Bottom line, it melts into your skin and works. I like it for keeping my skin toned and firm.  Just a small amount goes a long way and in my personal case, it has worked far better than what my expectations were.  If you are sitting on the fence, give this one a try because unlike many products, this one is a no brainer. Btw- the company is easy to deal with, communicates well and offers very fast delivery. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you for a great product that actually performs as per the description.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this lotion. It smells great. Within 4 days I noticed my stretch marks were lightened and my skin was tightened and firmer. I highly recommend it. Also the price is reasonable and it last a long time. Little is also needed each use.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product. The smell is mild and pleasant and goes on so silky smooth. I am on my second bottle now. I have a fairly large amt. of cellulite of the back thighs and some on my back side-URG. It took about a month to notice great results, I was fine with this. I was consistant to use this twice a day for these results. My cellulite was minimized and my skin was noticably firmer in look and feel. Its organic to boot which is just icing on the cake.If i&#x27;m going to be using this indefinately...lets keep it clean. Thank you for this product...don&#x27;t ever stop making it please :)</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever helped with my cellulite until this.  I am a huge fan and would highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with cellulite.  I exercised, tried other creams, massages and now I don&#x27;t have to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering was easy and I received the product promptly.  It&#x27;s easy to use with clear instructions and I noticed results within a few days.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products to help firm my aging and self-abused skin.  I am 42 and have had 4 children.  Unfortunately, I have a serious yo-yo diet problem that has most likely contributed to my serious \\&quot;cellulite\\&quot; (hate that word) issues.  Yes, I claim 100% responsibility for my lack of self-control, but I am oh-so happy to find a product that actually gives my skin back some of its lost youthfulness.&lt;br /&gt;  This product is easy to rub in and has a nice fragrance.  I use it on my legs (concentrating on the backs of my thighs and around my knees), waist, arms (especially on the backs of my arms and elbows), and my neck.&lt;br /&gt;  As for my contribution, I eat lots of fruits and vegetables, drink mostly water, coffee in the morning and an occasional glass of white or red wine at night.  I get plenty of protein from chicken, Greek yogurt, beans, etc.  I rarely, if ever, eat fried foods, but struggle with my weakness which is definitely sweets.  I swim 2-3 times a week for 45 minutes and walk on a treadmill.  So, I feel like I am trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;  Regrettably, this is not a MIRACLE product and so far, after my first bottle, has not completely rid me of my unsightly cellulite (hence, the 4 stars), however; it does significantly improve the appearance, and for this I will re-purchase.  I am now on my 2nd bottle, and hope to see more improvement as I go. I will update and happily change to 5 stars, if by chance; this product completely exonerates my \\&quot;problem.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  I imagine for someone that has a small cellulite problem, this product will do wonders!  So, absolutely worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;For those of us that are searching for a miracle product, this is, in my opinion, about as close as we can get.  ;)  So, again, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and the bottle feels light already. Time to repurchase and it&#x27;s worth every penny. It does work. During the past month my skin condition and appearance of cellulite was gradually improving. My girlfriends who haven&#x27;t seen me for a while noticed it first. If they noticed, it must mean its working. That was great to hear from a critical bunch like them. I am using it along with their massager. I am sure that helped too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change. Made my skin softer it seemed but who cares if I still have dimples lol oh well I should&#x27;ve known better when most reviewers were given free stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream based on the reviews and must I say, Hooray for Nuelle!! Finally something that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave any type of rash or dryness, it&#x27;s all natural and easy to use. It has a really cool feeling that is long lasting. I use it twice a day and have been for the past month now and I can actually see the results. I don&#x27;t want to bash any of the many other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but if you&#x27;re like me and have tried everything under the sun with poor results then you definitely need to try this out. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. It does what it says it will do and I will surely pick up another bottle once this one runs out. I&#x27;d say and agree that this product is definitely worth the money. And even better, it was a few bucks cheaper than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past that was claiming the same results.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions you should not have any problems whatsoever in getting the conclusion you seek.</li>
            <li> I have skipped the gym for at least 3 years and start seeing the cellulite for the first time a year ago.  I was horrified and have tried all kind of products in the market since.  Before I came across with NuElle Triple Action Cellulite Concentrate, I used Clarins products, the oil and the cream.  However, the NuElle has the amazing firming effect.  You will only see the result of the firming and reduce the cellulite if you use twice daily.  I think so far I have re-ordered at least 3 or bottles.  I also ordered the other products of Skin QR Organics.  Love the scrub, body creme, and facial foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this product only 4 stars due to the nature of the bottle and the size. (1)  I prefer it in a jar.  (2) The amount of the cream should be more due to multiple times use to be effective.</li>
            <li> I have to start right off with it WORKS! I also have to start right off with I only did one ARM so I could see if there was a difference. WHAT was I thinking?!?!? So from now on only look at my left side. DOES NOT look at my right side……. at least for the next 2 weeks, then I’ll be even again.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a light cream, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or tacky to the touch. I LOVE that!!&lt;br /&gt;In less than a two week period I could SEE a difference!! You can actually see the firming on the surface. On the inside you are detoxifying, reducing water retention and fat cell clusters, while improving circulation and overall appearance of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Nuelle twice a day, there is a very subtle citrus scent that dissipates quickly. It doesn’t interfere with my cologne or perfume. I can FEEL the tightening. So much so that I started using it on my neck, I love that tightening feeling! WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you NuElle for supplying me with a sample for this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product has worked for me - at least, not any better than much less expensive skin-firming lotions available at the drug store.  The fragrance is also less than flattering, so I have only been applying it at night when I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I&#x27;ll smell. I am a fit person with a few stubborn areas of cellulite, so I had hoped this product would help me out.  Really, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This cream does a nice job. I use it with a massager mitt and I&#x27;m thinking the combination of both helps.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle lotion, but it will help you even out and it reduces unsightly spots.  Your skins feels tacky for awhile until the lotion fully absorbs, then your skin is very soft. It even stays soft after showering again.  It&#x27;s worth a try but you&#x27;d have to use it for at least a full month or two.  One bottle lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> I’ve started using this product already so that when summer 2015 arrives, my cellulite will be a thing of the past. I’m going on another cruise next year and unlike my previous cruise, I plan to look fit and trim in my bathing suit. A friend told me about this product and then my sister tried it. That was all it took for me to jump on the band wagon. If something works well enough that people are bragging about it, I WANT IT. It took me longer than it took them to start seeing results but I’m now seeing results so I knew it was time for me to become the one bragging about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I love the light pleasant scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.  It absorbs quickly and has been a blessing in disguise where my cellulite is concerned.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this and I&#x27;m looking forward to putting on my bathing suit once again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought a bottle and used it every single day. I felt the difference within a week. My skin was so much more radiant and shiny, felt tighter and softer. I put it all over my legs, stomach, and arms. You sweat a bit with it on at night but that tells you it is really working. I am definitely going to buy another bottle! Best stuff I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now with consistent and noticeable results. I&#x27;ve tried NUMEROUS similar products over the years and have never been satisfied until NuElle. I generally use it twice daily and massage for 1 minute morning &amp; night. results are visible within a couple wks and with consistent use results are impressive. plus the smell &amp; texture are far better than many competitors.</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and leaves skin feeling really soft. I have not seen a reduction in cellulite yet, but I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, nothing gets rid of cellulite.  This product is better than a majority of the products I have tried, and I, like you, read the reviews before trying new products.  Non greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell.  It helps if used daily after skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is quick and the product comes wrapped well in bubble wrap so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking in transit.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that promise results.  FINALLY one that does what it says!  I will not say that your cellulite will disappear overnight, but with consistent use and a little time, the results are amazing!  I just ordered my 2nd bottle and will keep ordering!</li>
            <li> This product had a very rich consistency that made it very easy to massage into my skin.. It does have a bit of a strong scent that may not be appealing to everyone so I recommend using this product lower down to treat areas that can have cellulite like your stomach or legs rather than your upper arms. It contains an incredible 25 ingredients that help reduce cellulite and covers all of the issues with cellulite by creating a sauna effect, assisting with drainage, detoxifying, firming, and improving circulation. The best part is that this product is very competitively priced compared to other similar products. I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of this products as other body lotions to cover an entire area, making it a really great value. I used a 100% off coupon to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I had also ordered Adonia Leg Tone simultaneously because I had seen it reviewed on The Doctors-----It does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Nuelle Triple Action Concentrate actually does work, I have been  surprised and the price is so much better than&lt;br /&gt;the other product.  Other  reviews had mentioned the odor being  unpleasant  and that is so true, so instead of using it morning and night, I only use it at night so I don&#x27;t offend anyone during the day!!! It may take a while longer to see its full potential but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;willing to stick it out for a while.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Results were visible with continued use (follow the directions on product bottle).  Repeat customer for a reason with great thighs!</li>
            <li> The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother just in time for my first cruise to the Bahamas.  This is sticky for quite a while after applying, but works so well I don&#x27;t care.  I will be crushed if they discontinue this.  It&#x27;s also important to watch your fat and sodium intake, fighting cellulite takes more than slapping on a cream. See the book Beyond Cellulite.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Works far better than anything else I have tried and at a good price compared to the other products out there.</li>
            <li> This product feels very greasy and sticky.  I applied the product in the morning and wore shorts and it felt like I was sticking to everything, especially the leather seats in my car.  I&#x27;m just going to do more lunges and squats &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve ordered a couple times now. It leaves my skin feeling firmer and softer. Check out the list of ingredients--all good stuff! As an added bonus, it also smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and happy so far. I see skin texture improving and overall look is better. It&#x27;s a little expensive but for such a natural product that works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I am using for a week, but not a warm up feeling or anything. I am not sure if its working or not</li>
            <li> I like this product and most likely reorder again. There has been time when I hoped that I can find a miracle fix overnight and still continue eating junk. But alas. Those times are gone. The older I get, the harder it is to keep up with time and its consequences. However, I do believe that after I started using this cream coupled with somewhat regular-ish exercise has made a difference in my cellulite condition and firmness of the skin. I compared the ingredients to other lotions I used before and this stuff has won by far. Impressive list of healthy ingredients that work. If an improvement I see continues, I hope I can ditch my Spanx by summer.</li>
            <li> Smells like a spa? Are you kidding me? After reading all the wonderful reviews I was very excited when I received my product.  I immediately started using it two times a day and now it&#x27;s been two weeks. This product hasn&#x27;t changed anything yet however I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can put up with it.... I smell like a walking bug repellent. .. I would describe it like a sour citronella candle.  I will try to use it for another two weeks and update.</li>
            <li> Nothing eliminates cellulite but this lotion seems to minimize its appearance at least a little.  It also has a nice fresh citrus scent. The only problem is that you really need to put a lot on because it soaks in so easily.  So I find the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I actually re-ordered it. The bottle lasted me a little over a month (I applied it almost every day), and I started seeing results after about three weeks of using it. I like that the product is natural, it smells and feels good. My problem area was mainly on one leg (thigh area) where I could clearly see the cellulite dimples under my skin (I know, its weird), but now it looks smooth and matches my other leg. I also work out about five times a week, and I like to put this cream on right before I work out. I think I sweat more this way so it probably works better. Overall my skin feels firmer and small dimples seem a lot less noticeable. I am a 31 year old female.</li>
            <li> Does nothing of reducing cellulite. Just the effect of a nice lotion over your skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Don&#x27;t like the smells and too thick to put on.  Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I normally put it on twice or once a day usually before I workout around by hips. It&#x27;ll take some time to work, and know you can not fully get rid of cellulite but I have noticed a huge reduction in mine and I love it! Its easy to apply just like lotion and its worth the buy and if you use it without overdoing it, this product will last you a while. :)</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars. love the product. Makes your legs feel smooth and not oily</li>
            <li> I have to say I am truly impressed with this cellulite cream. I have just finished my first bottle and have ordered a second. Not only does it help with the appearance of cellulite, it actually slims. I was using it on my upper arms and I noticed a loss of about 1/4 inch on each arm and about that much on the thighs and butt. Plus it has all natural ingredients. The list of ingredients reads like a who&#x27;s who of the top essential oils and herbs used to combat cellulite. It smells great and is very moisturizing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> New great find for me. By now I have tried many cellulite treatments under the sun and this one takes the cake, if you ask me. It&#x27;s creamy but very light. Absorbs quickly and smells awesome. Barely a month into using it and I see amazing improvement in smoothness, condition and appearance of my skin and shape of my thighs and tummy. Worth trying. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review: This product is a white lotion like cream that you rub into your skin where you have visual cellulite.  It will start working on deleting the cellulite on the surface of your skin first, as least that is what I noticed as I used this product.  There is a slight scent but not strong at all, and its a scent that is refreshing to have on your skin.  Of the 3 different products that all fight cellulite, that I have had the opportunity to test, try and review, each of them have what is called a &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; feel due to the essential oils.  This &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation isn&#x27;t very strong with this product, and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable, unbearable, or something that would prevent you from wanting to use it.  I do however, recommend that when you rub this in, be prepared to wait a good 5-10 minutes if your schedule allows for your skin to air dry to help the &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; sensation to go a way quicker, than if you were to trap it in your clothing right after rubbing this product into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly attest to the fact that because I have used this product my upper thighs, and bottom now have a much decreased visual appearance of cellulite.  Also, I can feel the difference in my skin and body parts where I have used this product that the cellulite is actually decreasing, like it&#x27;s being burned off (from a workout when I say burned off) and not just being hidden.  This is a great product to use, but like any product that gives you visual results whether instant, or progressive results consistency is the key.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer and firming cream.  Probably the best you can expect in terms of a lotion reducing cellulite.  It does smooth and firm up the skin nicely and gives a little confidence boost when headed out in bathing suite.  Can take a little time to absorb.  Like using with the massage mitt too.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those skinny people with rippliness on the backs of my thighs. I&#x27;ve always had it since puberty, even at my thinnest. I feel as though this product is helping smooth things out. I massage it on with one of those plastic mitts with ridges. The only drawback is that my husband is not a fan of the smell, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> As i get older and my body isnt how it use to  be , i started looking for a product to help tighten up my skin. The product says it will take 2-3 wks for results, but I saw a huge difference in just a couple days, everything was so much smoother. Its kind of crazy to think they can make this stuff to really work. I plan on continueing to use this and make my skin look younger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this as a gift in exchanged for my hoonest review</li>
            <li> If you are truly looking to get rid of that Cellulite, look no further than NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Cream! I have been using this product for a month and I am noticing my skin becoming firmer and the dimples disappearing and I am so impressed. I have been using this in 2 different spots and I am Loving the results, that I may try a few more spots! I received this cream for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and I would definitely recommend! If you have dimples on your thighs or butt area, and you want them gone, try this! Anxious to see in another month of every day usage!  I&#x27;ll let you know!</li>
            <li> This is what my wife says about this product (she is the one who used it):&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. I have been looking for something like this for years. I bought similar products in Europe and was excited to see this on the American market. I have used it for over 2 months and noticed great results. It makes the skin smoother and reduces the appearance of &amp;#34;orange peel skin&amp;#34;. It goes on easily and has a nice smell. Of course, I used it together with a workout routine (I jogged 3 miles 2 to 3 times a week) and was more mindful of my diet. I am planning on stocking up on it for winter and using it throughout the year. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 29, so I feel old enough to start worrying about cellulite. I started trying different anticellulite creams and lotions. This cellulite concentrate is rather different from others in a positive way! It has great smell, nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky. And it really works!! I used it with Skin QR Body Scrub and massager brush twice a day and I have perfect results in a week! Thighs felt like a silk and skin became smooth and firm. This lotion made me ready for vacation in Miami Beach! I felt absolutely confident that my body looks great! Thanks a lot)</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone, smells great and feels great on skin! Will wait to see if good on cellulite, it has only been a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not only have I seen improvements in the 4 weeks I have been using it, but I love that it is made with all the very best ingredients! I have been using it with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed &amp;#34;and the &amp;#34;Phat QR Body and Cellulite Massager Waterproof&amp;#34; and the combination of all three has really improved the appearance of cellulite on my legs!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and it does what it says it would. I observed small but positive changes as short as after a week of use. Looks promising to me. If this speedy improvement continues, I soon will be skinny mini beautiful swim suit model looking. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> the product didn&#x27;t make any difference in my case, no improvement at all. Not buying it and not recommending to buy to anybody else.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered this multiple times. This product is excellent, REALLY work and work so quickly! I don&#x27;t apply it in the morning because it does make me feel somehow sticky (may due to sweating) so I only do it in the evening after work and about an hour before dinner time. I don&#x27;t do much exercises so I was so surprise when I noticed significant difference on my skin in just a few weeks, smoother and less rippled. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size, I wish it comes with bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been trying out several cellulite creams, being very aware that NO cellulite cream can cure this unsightly condition. I am looking for a cream that can tighten the skin a bit, so the cellulite becomes less visible. So far, I have only found two creams that do this, this is one of them. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product, but it is natural without perfume, which is more important to me. What I really like about this product is the packaging. You are not gonna waste anything, a huge plus for me. I noticed a change in the appearance of the cellulite in about three weeks. I tried a different product after that, which did nothing to me and the dimples returned. I am going to stay with this now, but you have to be aware that no cream will take away your cellulite totally and/or for ever. It is a commitment, you will have to use this as a daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuElle Tripple Action Anti Cellulite cream for several years. It is the best product I have found for reducing the appearance of cellulite on my thighs and stomach. I use it daily and never want to be without it. In all honesty, I begin to panic when my last bottle is half empty (I usually order 3-4 bottles at a time). When I use it once daily, the appearance of my cellulite reduces by more than half, but when I use it twice a day (as the manufacturer recommends), I can barely notice any cellulite dimples. It goes on smoothly and does not have a scent. More importantly, it absorbs nicely and is not sticky like some other products. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> The lotion smell good and it leaves my skin very smooth. I cannot really tell that it has really removed my cellulite, but I think combined with workout and proper food it will work well.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged mother of two teenage sons and have always seemed to struggle with a little extra weight around my middle and on my hips and upper thighs along with stretch marks from having children.  In the last year I have been seriously exercising and trying to reduce these areas along with the extra sag under my upper arms.  I&#x27;m getting help with this thanks to this NuElle Cellulite product.  I&#x27;ve noticed the stretch marks fading and getting less and less over the 9-10 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  The skin of my belly button area, hips, upper thighs and upper arms seems to be tightening up and the dimpling of the skin seems to be smoothing out as well and I think this will continue with continued use.  My only misgivings with this product is I wish it came in a larger size.  I have enjoyed the benefits of this product and look forward to even greater results with it in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate because it does the job. I noticed a big improvement with the cellulite on my thighs. The great smell and easy pump bottle is also a plus. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I just love it.  It works for me and I will continue using it.  Also it leaves your legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 or so weeks.  One word:  Awesome!!  I love it and will continue to use it.  Smells and feels great.  Great results.</li>
            <li> Love this, other than the scent 4 stars because of the scent. However..it seems to actually work!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times because I have notice my thights and arms have firm. Also  it is made with organic ingredients and in the US.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I do see some changes,  I do work out 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy, so with this combo I think it works</li>
            <li> I am the first time buyer, will need more time to evaluate it. But it smells good, good consistency and good absorption.</li>
            <li> I started using NuElle anti cellulite cream about 2 months ago and wil continue re-ordering it. The smell is fabulous, the consistency is perfect, andbest of all it really reduces cellulite. I have never felt more confident in a bikini and this will be my new necessity every summer.</li>
            <li> I have used many products and this one truly made a difference on my skin. My skin is firmer and thighter. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> The NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate is amazing.  I am fair and well lets just say that cellulite looks better when your are olive.  For me this product has worked miracles.  I&#x27;ve been using it since the beginning of the Summer since we are in Bathing Suit season and I have to say that I almost have no Cellulite left.  This is just after use of one month.  I have used this product together with the massager as well and that is how I believe you will get the results you are looking for.  I love this and will never switch to another product again.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t understand how this worked for others. My belly is almost close to flat, I just wanted to try this so I can get that tone and flat belly like I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Omg, nothing has changed , I am almost done with this bottle .&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to see if it actually works but I noticed immediatelly that this does not dry fast enough and it smells.  I waited at least a half hour before I dressed but I felt it on my legs all day long.  It was like it had not dried.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!! I used this for about a month and didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all in my skin. I thought that because of the price it was going to be much stronger than the Nivea Cellulite serum (which actually works better) but it wasn&#x27;t. Since then, I went back and bought the Nivea serum and after a week I was able to see my skin improving.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything over the counter to get rid of my cellulite. I am very toned and healthy &amp; the back of my thighs are the only area I have been self conscious about. I have seen a great improvement in 3 months. I recommend when you first use this products,put it on 2 x times a day. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle top can fall off and get this cream everywhere, so you have to be careful not to drop the bottle. Great Product &amp; I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle the NuElle Anti Cellulite Concentrate comes in.  The dispenser makes it so easy to apply.  I prefer pump dispenser and the NuElle is very sleek and you get the right amount every time.  This cream has a very faint fragrance, it&#x27;s a very light beautiful smell.  The NuElle Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate has a very nice creamy texture.  A little goes a long way with this product, especially if you massage it into your skin well.  noticed the diuretic properties pretty fast since it did make me sweat slightly the first few days of using it. The sweating was also a great reminder to increase my fluids.&lt;br /&gt;The NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate definitely made my thighs and buttocks area more firm.  My legs look more defined.  I am not sure if I noticed a definite reduction in cellulite, I have just a bit on my legs and I do think it will take more than a few weeks for the Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to be able to take full effect.  I am enjoying the way my legs feel, they feel smooth and my skin texture is nice and supple.  I plan to continue using to take advantage of the improved circulation and more toned look my legs have begun to have.  I&#x27;m thinking with continued use things can only get better.  Skin QR Organics recommends using 2 of their other products with this Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate, after reading how the products work together it makes sense that the results will be even greater using the scrub and massager.  I will need to check into those to enhance my already promising results.</li>
            <li> It appears to me the less fat and cellulite for the area being treated the faster this product works and the greater the cellulite is minimized.  I use on my upper arms and armpit, sad but true. Is there such a thing as &#x27;armpit lift&#x27;??  Anywhoo, this does work so well that I can wear short sleeves after applying cream.  I apply morning and evening every day. I saw immediate effects from day one. I give this a 4 because it does have a light fish odor combined with a ginger odor.  But it doesn&#x27;t linger after 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I only use this once a day because you get so little of it but it works! After 2 weeks my cellulite is just a small dimple and dare I say that my thighs are thinner? The effect wears off if you stop using it but who cares? I&#x27;ll keep using it forever! I love that its natural because I do like to stay far away from artificial anything.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very herbal but doesnt linger unpleasantly. I only wish that they made a SUPER sized bottle of this stuff because 5oz does not go a long way, especially if you used it twice daily like it says.</li>
            <li> This stuff and a belly band helps me lose all my baby weight within three weeks. I am now using it again or year and a half later and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice. After using the first order I switched to another brand and I don&#x27;t think I saw as good of a result. I find this product easier to use because of the pump. The smell is ok with me, and I don&#x27;t notice a tingle. However, I am used to high tingle tanning products. I believe that I have seen an improvement while using this product. Much better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried. I do also exercise daily, drink lots of water, and eat healthy about 50% of the time. I will order again if results continue.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for temporary tightening of my thighs after a shower. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to try yet another creme.  as with the others I&#x27;ve tried, it too just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it smells nice and it does moisturize pretty well.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product almost a month ago. I am a fitness bikini competitor and I have been looking for a product the reduce my cellulite or make it disappear (even better) so I came across this product. The first week I didn&#x27;t see any significant change but by the second week it was AMAIZING love love this product, it works wonders, my skin looks better and feels tighter as well. I love the mint smell, it&#x27;s strong when you apply it but does stay in your skin it blends really well. I will recommend this products to all my friends and family, I  am placing my second order.</li>
            <li> When I got the product I tried almost immediately. I have been using it for over 30 days now without doing anything else and I love this spa quality product. I love the fact that this product contains top 20+ well known botanical cellulite fighting ingredients, which is amazing in and of itself. It is a diuretic, improves circulation, reduces the appearance of cellulite overtime, firming, detoxifying, organic and all natural which is a major factor for me. I prefer natural products with ingredients from nature which has not been tampered with. This has a light cream texture, it is very easy to apply, a little goes a long way, it is also fast absorbing. NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate creates a sauna effect. (warming, not tingling or burning) which was crazy to me at first but it did not cause any type of irritation or side effects of any kind. I believe that the sauna effect it what really sets this product apart.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen many results. The smell is great but I wouldn&#x27;t reorder it.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I HAVE BEEN USING NUELLE TRIPLE ANTI CELLULITE LOTION FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, AND I LOVE IT. I TRIED MANY MANY MANY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, BEING NAME BRAND HIGH END PRODUCTS (CLARINS), AND NUELLE ANTI CELLULITE LOTION IS THE ONE I HAVE STUCK WITH. IT REALLY WORKS! I SURF AND I AM AT THE BEACH ALL THE TIME IN MY BIKINI, AND I TRULY TRUST AND LOVE WHAT THIS PRODUCT HAS DONE FOR MY THIGHS! THANK YOU SO MUCH NUELLE! :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> No results at all. I bought this after having a baby and getting cellulite. I used it religiously for 30 days and did not see one bit of a difference. Really hoped for some visible change ... unhappy</li>
            <li> I was *very* skeptical of this but decided to go ahead and try it out due to all of the positive reviews. Let me tell you - this really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I&#x27;m a 25 year old male(guys get cellulite too), 5&#x27;6, 130 lbs. I started noticing cellulite on the sides of my stomach, near my arm pits, and on my stomach. It&#x27;s not terribly bad, but it is noticeable in the sun light and whenever I bend down. I blame that due to a bad diet (I do love me some good beer!) and not being as active as I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for two days (yes, only two days!) along with the seaweed body scrub and I can already see results! I still can&#x27;t believe how quick this works. Now let me say, this doesn&#x27;t get rid of cellulite completely, but I can already see a drastic improvement in the way it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I am going to continue using this! Keep in mind that my cellulite is very minimal so that may be why I can already see results, but this product really does work. I would honestly recommend this product to anyone who is self conscious about their cellulite without any hesitation. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try!</li>
            <li> nothing good to say, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Even though I am 57 and really active, I have been bothered by some dimpling on my thighs.  This product in conjunction with the scrub has made the biggest difference in the appearance of my skin....in the shortest amount of time.  I really feel that when I rub it into my in a circular motion....that it is really absorbed by my skin.  I also find the scent very spa-like and I really look forward to applying after my bath.  This is my second order!!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of creams to reduce cellulite over the past 10 years. I am 29 and have been struggling with cellulite since my teens. I am an average size and even when I am at my fittest, any remaining fat is always lumpy. This is the only cream that I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smell and hasn&#x27;t left a sticky residue after application. The smell is similar to an old B&amp;BW Lemon Meringue body creams that I used to use. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed the texture of the skin on my legs and butt improve. I have seen a slight improvement in cellulite so far, and hope to see more. I am working out and eating a fairly clean diet as well.</li>
            <li> OMG have you looked at the ingredients? Absolutely great for any women. I just have moderate cellulite, and I have been using it with my vacuum cup. And I can definitely see the results! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had the best results with thing product comparing to other brands. It makes a great sauna effect. That&#x27;s why I use it before going to bed. Even though I forget to use it every day, I see the awesome results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not sure why there are couple negative reviews about the smell of the cream. It smell great! It has nice, soothing, soft sent that helps me relax even more.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product and I simply love it.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and it also smells great.  I use it on my arms, stomach and thighs.  I also use the body blasting scrub along with this and the two work so well together.  This is also great as a hand treatment.  At night, after using the scrub on my hands, I apply this concentrate and wear gloves to keep my hands soft.  I will be ordering more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  04-18-2013.  I received another order of this today and will continue to purchase more.  Have seen a slight improvement in the way my skin looks. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried and tested a lot of anti cellulite cream and this is the only thing that I am buying twice, and I am definitely buying more. Together with the L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub, they made my skin firmer. It keeps my skin moisturized all day and I love its smell, too. One should find what works for him/her and stick to it, only then we can achieve real result. For me, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt for about a month and I am pleased with the results.  My cellulite isn&#x27;t all gone, but there is a definite improvement!  Overall my skin appears smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve tried others that don&#x27;t give any results at all. But this product starts to show results within a couple of weeks, You have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day. It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft and smooth plus it smells great. Also a little bit goes a long way because it goes on so smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft, so the crepy look is now gone. However after two weeks the cellulite is still there. It has a nice smell though your skin will feel gooey for about 30 minutes after application. It did not damage clothing. If it could actually remove cellulite I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this cream by a sales person at a local spa a few month ago. . Although I have always been skeptical about these types of products and exercise regularly to keep up staying healthy, I still decided to give it a try. Summer is almost here and I can use some help, to be ready for the beach. Right away I could notice how smooth and firm my skin was getting, and after a month of use I can definitely say that this product is worth a shot. And here on Amazon it’s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. A waste of money and time, don&#x27;t now what I was thinking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and can already see results! It&#x27;s amazing...I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and none have ever worked for me. I would highly recommend trying NuElle. I have just purchased my second bottle and look forward to seeing even more results!</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the clear difference on my skin looking after I used the product for probably 6 times. It is amazing difference and I am so excited to use more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and it seems to be working.  I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the products in market. This is the only one that works. It really tightens the areas where you apply it and you can see it happening time by time.</li>
            <li> This product was a great addition to assisting me in tightening and toning my stomach and thighs!  I absolutely love it! I began using it a little over a month twice a day in conjunction with the sauna belt for my stomach and thighs.  I also incoporated a healthier diet and a little excercise (Squats, lunges, leg lifts). I&#x27;m definitely looking a lot slimmer these days!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described. This is my second order of this product over time you do notice results. The cream is not extremely greasy and leaves skin soft throughout the day. I will order from this product again.  Product is packaged well ensuring it remains secure during the shipment.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! It works so well with the body scrub. It&#x27;s goes on very smooth and keeps your legs looking great!! My legs have less dimples and appear more toned. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and I think it&#x27;s really helped smooth out my thighs and bum. And it absorbs quickly-not at all sticky as I&#x27;ve found with some creams. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this cellulite, body cream. The smell is amazing-Not medicinal smelling like some products--more refreshing, w/ out that horrible burn...a slight tingle--which is good....know it&#x27;s working!  Second time buying it....and will once again--Thankyou!</li>
            <li> This item seems to contain the right ingredients to fight cellulite, but the best I can say for it is that it does make your skin feel smooth and silky.  It also makes your skin feel warm which I take to mean that there is some sweating going on, which could lead to a decrease in leg circumference.  However, as far as reducing cellulite, it doesn&#x27;t.  This doesn&#x27;t, however, surprise me, since there appears to be no topical product out there that does.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-forties, and I have worked out since I was a teenager.  I have maintained a healthy weight, and try to stick to a healthy diet.  But, no matter how good I am, I always have some cellulite.  I have tried numerous creams, pills, even expensive treatments, and have stopped using them due to the poor results.  After my first bottle of this cream, I felt it was actually working and decided it was worth trying another bottle.  After the second bottle, I was hooked.  It does not totally get rid of all of the cellulite.  But, it is the closest to a miracle that I have used.  The texture is great, smell is minimal, and leaves your skin feeling so soft that you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer. The pump bottle is awesome.  It delivers the right amount with no waste, and is great for travel.  I am on my fourth bottle, and not only has my cellulite diminished, but my skin is also more firm.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It actually does what is suppose to do, and I&#x27;ve tried others with no result. I highly recommend it, it smells good too!I could not do without it.</li>
            <li> No results yet and almost finished with one bottle. Great moisturizer though, skin feels smooth after application,  cellulite reduction,  no.</li>
            <li> great supplier and great product</li>
            <li> 5 Stars, more like 100 Stars. I LOVE this product. I have tried several other anti-cellulite creams with no results. But with this cream I started to see results in the first week. Thank you Argania for this amazing product &amp;#60;3 xxoo</li>
            <li> Not too strongly fragranced, goes on very smoothly. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is firmer with NuElle than with other creams and gels said to fight cellulite, but there is no substitute for proper exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing dry brushing for a few months to combat cellulite and decided to add this cream to my regime based on all the positive reviews. The product lasted exactly three weeks using it twice a day as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is smooth and easy to apply. It smells lemony and the smell lingers for a long time. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell or the sticky feeling left on my skin which stayed that way even by the next morning. My thighs stuck together and my rear end stuck to the toilet seat. They also claim it creates a slight sauna effect but that was not something I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience but I would have put up with it if the product had actually worked. It didn&#x27;t. There was no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product! I was amazed at how many fabulous ingredients and how it worked, You don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area. I only use about a quarter size. That allows me to spread all over my thighs and butt without wasting any product. The dispenser made it easy to use and portable so I can take it with me when I travel. It was great to see that the instructions were clear of when to apply lotion, so that you get the results.When I applied it, it smelled great, and I was able to feel it actually working! After I applied it after exfoliating, I would wake up and notice a difference of the way my skin looked and felt. As I have used more than one bottle, I see the results work every time I use it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to change their skin into silk and have it be smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and with all the good reviews I decided to go for it - WELL, it did absolutely NOTHING!!  Dont waste your money because it simply does not work. To rid of cellulite you must eat healthy, add some cardio daily and do lots and lots of squats!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter about a month ago.  She is 14 and has autism.  She is on several medications that are contributing to her rapid weight gain.  With the weight gain came a lot of cellulite:  thighs - front and back, buttocks/hips, and the front of her knees.  Since using this product, the cellulite on her buttocks/hips is about 80% gone.  It&#x27;s about 75% gone on the front of her thighs and 50% gone on the backs of her thighs.  The only area that doesn&#x27;t seem to be benefiting is the front knee area.  I can honestly say that it is working well.  I&#x27;ve been using it on her very liberally, twice a day, but since other reviewers are using it 1x daily and getting good results, I will cut back.  It&#x27;s expensive, so I am going to use it sparingly and hope it continues to work.  Excellent product.  I also purchased cups, but she can&#x27;t tolerate the suction, so I may try the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-16-14  I wanted to give an update: I was away for the weekend and for 3 days, my husband did not use the cream on my daughter.  When I returned the cellulite had returned to her buttocks/hip area, but the front of her thighs looked better. So, my thought is that it has to be used on a regular basis to maintain good results.  I&#x27;ve cut back to using it once a day - we will see how that works out.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am getting this product for my lady. She loves it. And I do, because she does. I liked and like the way she looks because I love her, and I don&#x27;t understand why all women are so preoccupied with cellulite. But if it makes her happy and feel better about her body, I will buy another 100 if she asks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a cellulite -free skin even after having my kid.i&#x27;m heavily into fitness and consider myself a bit of a workout \\&quot;freak\\&quot;. I hit the gym or the outdoors at least 5 times a week;sometimes twice a day for intense routines.But about 2-3 years ago, i started noticing a subtle,disgraceful orang peel-like  skin on my thights and around my knees.YUCK!!! yes,i was unfortunately gaining weight. healthier eating habits and my work out routines helped keep the weight somewhat in check but not the orange peel-like skin .So i decided to try Nuelle cream.I think NuElle cellulite cream is a good product.I&#x27;ve purchased it 5 times already.The cream is organic, light and fast absorbing;it has great ingredients and a very pleasant smell.The first time i used it,i was surprise by the lasting diuretic effect but that&#x27;s probably because it was flushing out toxines( and fat?).The most amazing thing for me about this cream is its firming action.my skin is firmer and the ugly little fatty bumps are not growing any bigger. I think this cream helped achieve that result.I also  believe the effects of NuElle Triple Action Cream will be complimented by diet and exercice.I&#x27;ll recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this cream, but I like it already.  It smells wonderful, has many herbal ingredients, and leaves my skin very soft.  I hope it will work on the cellulite as well, but it&#x27;s a pleasure to use in the meantime.  It leaves a slight warmth when it&#x27;s rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this Cream! I really like it and it smells great! It also leaves your skin feeling soft!  I was delighted when I opened my package to see that they had sent me some samples of their other products! being organic is a plus, I am not much on chemicals, It is a pleasure knowing what I am putting on my skin is natural ingrediants made by God, and put into a lotion :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, twice a day every day as suggested on the label, and haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but there is a difference. I will continue to use this until the bottle runs out and decide whether or not to buy another one. But other than that, the cellulite has diminished slightly and I am pleased. Like I said, not a miracle product, but still is good if your cellulite isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product itself, it has a weird peppermint/mint smell that is really strong. I&#x27;m personally not too fond of the smell, but you get used to it after a few uses. The product also is greasy, so if you are going to put on some clothes right away I suggest you put on the clothes that you know for sure that you are going to wear for at least a few hours. You should also wash your hands right away because they will feel gross. There is a controlled pumped for the amount of the product released, and that is nice so that you don&#x27;t overuse the product (believe me a little goes a long way!). Overall this product isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Really good product, I use it as it is in the direction and my skin looks much better. Very happy :) ! Already order another one.</li>
            <li> This is the second product of this type I&#x27;ve ever used and I chose to try this one based on all the positive reviews. I am very thin and have virtually no body fat and I work out consistently. My biggest frustration has been my lumpy thighs. Nothing I have done has ever helped and I really didn&#x27;t believe in products claiming to do what this product claims it does. It doesn&#x27;t factitiously claim that the fat will go away even if you stop working out or managing your healthy diet and that this product will miraculously burn away your fat forever. The manufacturersIt states that the lumpy appearance will diminish and that&#x27;s exactly what it has done for my thighs. I have been using it consistently for 3 months while continuing my exercise and healthy diet and I am thrilled with the results. I have done it without any other cellulite devices.  I would recommend it to anyone who is active, thin, manages their diet but still has lumpy thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoly</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference with this and I don&#x27;t have much cellulite. I have about 6 holes on my thigh that bother me and after using this cream they are still there.</li>
            <li> I used this 2 - 3 times a day, in conjunction with a roller, and noticed very little to no effect.</li>
            <li> Tried several lotions, gels and creams without any results but can honestly say that NuElle Triple Action is effective in treating Cellulite.  Its not an overnight fix by any means but within 3 - 4 weeks I started seeing noticeable results.  I am not overweight but actually rather athletic but still suffered from the cellulite on my thighs... only complaint I have is the bottle does not last very long especially if you use the lotion twice a day so it can get a bit pricey... in my opinion if its working its worth it though so will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I like it . smell very nicely- smooth to apply . will buy again</li>
            <li> I think it works! I&#x27;ve been using this after scrubbing my thighs with a coffee exfoliating soap. It&#x27;s smells okay. Info work out and eat right but I think this has helped my over all cellulite appearance. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The Nuelle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite treatment is phenomenal! I scrub my body with  Argania&#x27;s Body Blaster Scrub, and I follow it up with Nuelle. 85% of my cellulite is gone!  Thank you Argania!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 bottles of this before leaving feedback. I am in my 40&#x27;s , I exercise regularly, eat well, but I have always had cellulite. Now I am at the point of not wanting to wear a swimsuit. I had always used Clarins,but since using Nuelle I am much happier with the results. Nuelle provides lots of moisturizing, instantly makes my skin look more plump while ongoing use has definitely reduced my cellulite. I know I will never get rid of my cellulite, but the improved appearance has made me a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I bought first one and saw effect in couple of weeks. I just bought second one and I like it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping it would work but prepared for disappointment since one often hears the refrain, “If something sounds too good to be true….”  Well, surprise, surprise, surprise after using NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate for two months I am very pleased with the results and have placed a second order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ‘problem areas’ are thighs and buttocks.  Before using the NuElle product the ripples of my cellulite were visible through some of my tighter fitting pants -- not a good look!  However, fairly consistent use of this anti cellulite cream has truly and noticeably tightened and smoothed the skin in these areas to where I would even consider wearing a bathing suit this summer, that’s how much of a difference I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviews mention the aroma as a negative, but I find the scent pleasing.  Everyone has a unique chemical make up and there may be some people who respond differently but for me, it works great and I foresee this becoming a permanent part of my beauty routine akin to night cream and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used as directed for four weeks and I didn&#x27;t see the results people mentioned. I think its a hoax.</li>
            <li> Update: in my original review, I wrote: ... \\&quot;I discovered that while the container part of the bottle (not including the pump) is about 6 inches tall, the interior of the container is only about 3 inches deep. So you&#x27;re only getting about half the volume that it appears from the outside of the container.\\&quot;  ... I heard from the seller, and this is incorrect. She wrote \\&quot;You mentioned that the depth of the bottle is 3. That is not correct. What you saw when you looked inside is the piston, that pushes the cream up, when you pump. When the bottle is new, that piston is siting all the way down at the bottom of the bottle.\\&quot; So, thank you to the attentive seller for the correct information, and for a little lesson in engineering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried many products over many years, I had settled on St. Ives cellulite shield, which I did think helped somewhat, then they stopped making it (I see it is now available again). So I did an exhaustive search and settled on this. I ordered one bottle along with the L&#x27;Or de la Mer Annti Cellulite Body Blaster scrub, which I used in the shower with a hard scrubber thing. I used up the scrub long before the NuElle and decided not to re-order the scrub because it was expensive, didn&#x27;t last long and got very thin very quickly (I guess water getting into the container). Anyway, kept using this and I have to say I think it&#x27;s helping. It&#x27;s pleasant to use--a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky and leaves skin very soft. The smell is not very good--not terrible--but it doesn&#x27;t linger after the lotion is absorbed. The main indicator for me that something is happening is that when I stand in strong overhead light (sunlight, some dressing rooms--what are they thinking?!?!), when I look down at my thighs, I see much less rippling. I ordered two more bottles, and I&#x27;m just starting the first of those. On thing to note: I packed my first bottle in a checked bag, and when I got it out after the flight, the top had popped off the container. I travel quite a bit and I&#x27;ve never had this happen with anything else. I guess this is a vacuum-type dispenser or something because while I could get the lid back on, the pump no longer worked, so for the rest of that bottle I just scooped it out with my fingers and duct-taped the bottle closed for the trip home.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month already and have noticed a big difference in the smoothness of my skin. I&#x27;ve always had problems with cellulite and this product is worth the money! It also has a wonderful lemon scent too!</li>
            <li> This is an ok product, it smells good and feels good on my skin. It does look better but not really the desire effects for the cost.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. Been using from last couple of months &amp; can tell the difference. I will be ordering more in the future. Don&#x27;t forget to do the exercises if you wanna see the results faster.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had to purchase a lot of this kind of product &amp; this one is the best . It was less expensive than a lot of the other ones I tried also.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it for several months now and have seen a big improvement in the back of my thighs. They are smoother and firmer and look much better. I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li> Can see a difference after 2weeks! Use 2x/day I think for best results, drink plenty of water! Then,,,&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly I started to see an improvement. My skin is firmer and tighter and slight ripples I had are not so visible any more. Truly impressed. Combined with the scrub, it&#x27;s a perfect combination to fight age and cellulite.</li>
            <li> This product is great for reducing cellulite.....definitely noticing a difference.....even in how my legs feel. Improved circulation flow. Also, my skin is so soft from this product! LOVE that it&#x27;s all organic!  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great staff.Really you can see results. with some simple diet results will be fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different product before but this cream is the only one that actually works! I followed the directions, using once a day, and after a week or so I saw real smoothing results! The lemon citrus scent is lovely too. And I love that it has organic ingredients! Definitely worth a try, I wish they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> This product has amazing effects on my skin....love the fragrance...absorbs into my skin.  Texture and feel of my skin after applying is excellent!!! Your skin will feel so soft...looks better...this makes you feel better. Especially as we get yes, younger I like to think younger...can look younger, for this product does just that!!!!!!!!!!! My skin looks and feels so much younger. You get my drift. A good choice compared to so many products that say they do the trick although fail at it every time. This product works!! Try it and you will see it for yourself!! Thank you again for an excellent product! Keep us, the public supplied with products that actually do what they say they are going to do. Not a waste of money actually the opposite!!  Worth it by far!!! Good job!!!!</li>
            <li> this did not do anything for me and I used this in a body wrap, then I used this in plastic vinyl sweat pants. Then plastic wrap this is a waste. someone told me there is a receipe on youtube to make home cellulite cream I believe I will try that but this is a waste and it stinks I hope this helped</li>
            <li> I like this product seems to work but one must remember you really cannot get rid of Cellulite with a cream  I do believe you can kee[ it from getting worse by using this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It tights around lose fat. It kept my skin soft and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> After using the lotion for 3-4 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in the overall appearance of my upper thighs. The application never fully dries, so it can be a hassle putting on tights in the morning. Aside from that minor issue, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing the lotion for the summer :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has worked like a charm! I use this product after the shower everyday for the last 2 months and I have seen great results. Tighter skin and less visible cellulite. I would recommend this product to everyone ! It is also a great price and ships in 2 days!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NuElle triple action anti cellulite concentrate for approx. 5 months now and have to say in all my years (I&#x27;m almost 53) of using supposed anti-cellulite lotions and potions, this one actually works!  You have to use it continuously, but you should moisturize anyway, so you get an awesome double benefit! Hallelujah!  Just try it and for the price, it&#x27;s a win win!</li>
            <li> This one is so different and effective it has it in more things to fight the flab than any I have used yet . Its all natural and is not artificially scented but smells so pretty. its easy to use and goes far beyond what others do to not only fight flab but make the skin you apply it to look smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt; I received a sample to try in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve lost over 40 pounds in the past year. I do not exercise so I have cellulite pretty bad. While I know that I need to start exercising, I still wanted to research about cellulite and firming creams. I am happy that I came across this NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate. I have been using this for approximately two weeks now. I have not seen dramatic results since I have only been using it for a short period of time. My thighs do seem to be a bit tighter though. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after longer use. I am starting to use this on my neck also. I am hoping that it will make my neck tighter.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tall white bottle with a pump. The cream is thick and a little sticky but absorbs great. It has a distinct smell. I can&#x27;t quite figure the smell out. Maybe the smell is similar to ginger. My husband says it smells similar to lemon Pledge. The smell does stick with you temporarily. It is suggested to use two hours after a meal or one hour before you eat because your body will only burn fat when it has none in the metabolism. I use it after I get out of the shower and at night before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try in exchange for my review. However, all opinions are honest and my own and are not influenced in any way. No other form of compensation was received. I only recommend products I think are worth sharing.</li>
            <li> So, girls we all have those trouble areas which we all hate, no matter what size we are. I was chosen to try out this product and I was really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s, first start out by a funny story though about me testing this out! So, I guess I was too eager to get started, and didn&#x27;t read the directions very well at first. I thought I bet it would work well while I am sleeping, well, that was not a good idea at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slathered a lot on everywhere and went to bed. Well, I could not get to sleep at all, I kept on tossing and turning, I felt fidgety and too anxious and was like what the heck is wrong with me, why am I feeling this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got up in the morning and decided to look at the ingredients more carefully, it turns out it has caffeine in it, so no wonder I was feeling the way I was! My mistake, my goofy self should of read more on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels and the fast absorption into the skin, and it also has a light fragrance too. I am not seeing drastic difference, but don&#x27;t have much of a problem, but I am continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for preventive care if you don&#x27;t already have cellulite. I keep this bottle close after I shower in the morning and before I head to bed. It has a dual feature, for 1 it really works; keeps the skin tight and really does play a preventive role on top of eating right and exercise when it comes to fighting cellulite. It&#x27;s second purpose, is the scent, I love it. It kind of puts me in a nice space before I hit the pillow. A nice aroma. My butt, thighs and stomach are cellulite free and I think with the NuElle anti-cellulite cream, my body will remain that way for a long time.</li>
            <li> Skin QR Organics Anti Cellulite cream has a mild scent, but it lasts all day. There was no menthol feel which is what I expected and it dried quickly. I would also recommend placing it somewhere you will remember to use it at least daily. Initially I had it in my bathroom on my vanity, but would forget to apply it. My tip is to place it in the shower so when you are done and dry off you can apply it right in the shower. The label is not paper and will not dissolve or wear off in the shower so that should not be a worry. I think they thought of everything when they made the packaging of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great with the negative air pump. you can pump out as much or as little as you want. I normally use 1 full pump for each of my thighs, which is where i needed to focus on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sadly somehow deleted my before picture. You can see I still have cellulite to the back of my legs, but it is definitely much less. I do try to eat healthy all the time, but have to admit those potato chips and soda every so often are so tempting. I also exercise 30 min to 1 hour daily. The cellulite on the back of my legs have been the hardest to get rid of for me. Also remembering to apply is daily was difficult as stated above and again for me placing in the shower was the easiest way for me to remember to apply it daily. If you always apply a cream nightly just place this where you would normally use your routine product. I was sent this to review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle where cellulite is concerned, it takes regular massaging and the appropriate product for one&#x27;s body. I have tried expensive and mainstreet treatments and many in between, with little success. I try to use NuElle for daily massaging (in the morning after the gym) of my lower body and after a few months my skin really looks smoother and tighter. Even after a gap of 2-3 weeks it still looks good. But you&#x27;ve got to keep using it for long lasting effects - as any other product. The cocktail of 25 plant extracts is unique among cellulite treatments and provides great moisturizing effect in addition to cellulite blasting. The smell is surprising but quite fresh and green. My skin drinks the cream rather quickly so I can get dressed soon after using it. The pump is easy to use and provides the right amount of product for me. Will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I have lost 135 pounds in the last year which has left me with a lot of loose saggy skin that is not very desirable. I have tried several different creams and body wraps to no avail. It has been very frustrating to say the least. I have all of this newfound confidence with my clothes on however will my clothes off I am still just as insecure. I know deep down I should be happy with the way I am, I have made a huge accomplishment but for some reason I can&#x27;t let it go.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try Skin QR Organics, NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite for free in return for an honest product review. I was hoping that I would have success with it! I will try anything at this point. As soon I got my free bottle I started to use it 2-3 times a day making sure to run it in really well. The cream is nice and thick and creamy. It smells amazing and rubs in easily it leaves a tiny bit of a residue but not bad. It also gives your skin a fresh cooling feeling which I loved. After a few weeks of use I have to say I have noticed a definite difference! My skin looks a lot more even and my skin looks firmer. Old stretch marks and some scars have lightened quite a bit. I will continue to use. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This organic cellulite firming lotion is the first I have tried in its kind. Being that I am a small girl I do have cellulite in my thigh and butt area and for no one no matter size would attest to liking this. This 5oz bottle of NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate was used as my lotion day and night to make sure I can receive maximum results. Just by looking at the ingredients, there are so many great oils that are ofcourse amazing for your skin, such as: Aloe, Sunflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Geranium essential Oil, Rosehip Oil, Evening Primrose Oil.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other oils and ingredients that were interesting because I have never really noticed them in lotions. Some examples are caffeine, ginkgo biloba, kelp, cinnamon and cayenne. After reading some more, it did say that it has a diuretic effect and it works both on the surface and in depth. It contains 25 flub busters and caffeine being one that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction.&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using it, I first noticed the scent which was pleasant and reminded me of wintergreen mixed with lemon grass. Very intriguing. The texture was a bit lighter than other regular lotions which did not make it greasy but very absorbent. It has not replaced my moisturizing lotion but I have opted to use it solely on certain areas such as my thighs, butt and stomach. I have seen very minimal changes along my thigh area and these changes are for the better. My thigh area is smoother in the feel and slightly looks less uneven. I think with continuous use there may be even more improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I can definitely see the difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture.  I am happy with the results and will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice scent and seems to work nicely. Also I was very happy with how quickly the product arrived. I would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> The produnct is great! So far, i am using for 2 weeks The thights feel different, more tight</li>
            <li> I just ordered by second bottle of the lotion. In the description it says that you will feel a warming affect similar to a sauna, you definitely feel it.  I am using this primarily on my thighs an gluts and I have noticed my skin feels smoother and softer.  I am hopeful that I will see more results on my upper thighs before summer.  Glad I chose this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after a month of consumption.  However, I like its scent and makes my skin smooth.  No changes on the cellulite appearance though.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am ordering my second bottle of this stuff. I originally ordered this with the sewed scrub and massager balls. I also ordered the Finulite  as well. I started off with the seaweed scrub and used the Finulite for about 3 weeks. It seemed like I noticed some improved tone, but the cellulite was still very apparent. When the Finulite  was gone after about 3 weeks, I started using the NuElle. It seemed as if I could see a difference within the first week ( the Finulite could have contributed to that). I can really see a difference with the appearance of my cellulite on butt and thighs. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still there, but I am confident that with the continued use of this product I&#x27;ll  be able to wear me some short shorts this summer. This gives me approximately 2 more months. I didn&#x27;t  really  care for the scrub? Now about me. I am 5&#x27;2, 36 years old BF and currently weigh 122 pounds.  I work out moderately ( recently purchased a Rebounder which is suppose aid in cellulite reduction as well). You would think with my size cellulite wouldn&#x27;t be an issue...but it is. I&#x27;ve always been really small weighing only about 100 pounds up until my sophomore year in college. At that time I got up to 115 pounds ( yippee). But with that very appreciated weight gain, the cellulite came :(. I used to just deal with it because I knew it was mostly genetic. I recently became proactive because I wanted to start focusing on being and looking healthy ( not getting any younger). I am very pleased with this product. Just the other day when I was sitting, I happened to glance at my thighs ( had on pants), they actually looked fit and toned. Usually they would SPREAD ALL OVER  the place, but now they look more fit and trim. I love it! I&#x27;m sure the exercising has helped as well. Anyway, it works for me. I&#x27;m loving it, and will continue to buy...good luck...</li>
            <li> I got this originally based on other product reviews, but I was skeptical. However, after using the product, I am convinced! My skin is smoother and more toned. I have been working out, but this has added a little extra to help tone my thighs and stomach and remove the bumpiness of cellulite. I have gotten another bottle and expect to continue seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an effective Anti Cellulite cream for years, and this is absolutely the BEST product on the market. Ive been using this formulation for nearly 3 weeks and I have seen a HUGE improvement in the tone/texture of my thighs and waste line.  The ingredients are super clean , amazingly effective and I love how my skin drinks it in.  I am beyond satisfied!! this one works ladies, the scent is herbal, utilizing the main essential oils that combat cellulite so don&#x27;t expect a flowery scent, its more like a lemongrass base. You wont be disappointed if you follow their suggestions in usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to enhance my results, and that is what NuEllle did for me. When clean eating and excising was not enough, NuElle helped me reduce fat and get firm. Cant wait to get my next bottle. A must to add to every workout routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for second time ,and all i have to say is i&#x27;m so happy with it.It&#x27;s very easy absorptive  and smell god ,and after using  him ,my  skin look  better.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel nice and smooth with some of the best  quality products on the market definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product…I&#x27;ve used it since June 2014. I have tried two different products during this time frame (one more expensive and one less expensive) and I get better results with NuElle. I apply it in the morning before my workout because the thermo effect allows me to lose 2-3 pounds of water (depending on the exercise) and I apply it before bed. However the product is not magic, you must decrease processed sugar and high sodium foods, drink lots of water, along with exercising to see quick and lasting results.</li>
            <li> After purchasing one bottle of this and using it up, I have purchased three more!  This is the best firming lotion I have ever used, and I have used numerous others, including Clarins and Heavy Duty (by Jocott) brands.  What I like about this cream is that my thigh and backside skin has become tighter, so much softer, and the dimples are a lot less noticeable.  I use it after a shower in the evening, and again in the morning.  The smell is very nice, too.  I also use it on my stomach and arms, and they look and feel amazing, too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF 3 ANTI-CELLULITE CREAMS.  VERY NICE MOISTURIZER AND I APPRECIATE THE INGREDIENTS ARE HEALTHY BUT IT DID NOT ONE BIT OF GOOD FOR MY MILD CELLULITE.</li>
            <li> Help!! I recently purchased this cream and only after a few days of using it my cellulite is more pronounced and worse than ever before. What&#x27;s even scarier it&#x27;s now in areas I applied cream that I had no cellulite before using it. My questionis, has anyone else ever experienced this? And does it get worse before improving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked the sellers and they didn&#x27;t really have an answer for me, except that maybe I am allergic or retaining water due to salty food/sodium intake/ stress/ monthly cycle. But I have never had any allergies and eat very heathy (minimal salt and sugar intake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so afraid this cream has ruined my legs. I even took a photo after using it and my cellulite is significantly worse than before.  Anyone with advice?</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this bottle for a few weeks now so my opinions are based on that. I received the product free* to try and review. I think a product like this really needs long term use, at least using the entire product up before you can truly know how well it works. I’m not sure that three weeks have given it enough time to make real visible changes in cellulite. I’ve dropped it a star for no visible changes, but if I see visible changes I will come back and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this as a moisturizer, it goes on light and absorbs quickly as long as I dry myself off well first. I like to use it after my morning showers and one of the times I didn’t dry off well because I was running behind on time it made the lotion feel sticky on my skin. I quickly learned that if I dry off well it absorbs and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling or residue behind. Its description mentions that it might have a sauna like effect, but I have not felt that. It feels like any other creams or lotions that I have used. I do have sensitive skin and this has not bothered my skin at all so I would say it is safe for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty big girl, so I&#x27;m thinking that for someone like me I might need a little more time or work to get the results that I would like to get from this cream. I&#x27;m under no illusion that there is a cream that will work to make me look perfect over night. Results might vary based on size and skin type, so if you really want to know how it works you really need to try it for yourself to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this product for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients and incredibly effective product.  I will be buying it from now on â™¡</li>
            <li> I bought an entire set a couple of months ago and replenishing for sure now. Well worth the product&#x27;s price. Good quality, last a while and they work.  This lotion smells amazing, makes my skin soft and firm and I like all the natural ingredients in it. Feels good actually using something with no harmful chemicals. Pump dispenser is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I used every drop as directed and there is no noticeable difference. Just wishful thinking.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money..</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS. This review will talk about the PROS, CONS, PACKING DETAILS, and my personal experience with this product. I have tried drug store $10 stuff (Nivea) / higher end $60+ stuff (Clarins) and none of them seem to be showing any results. I thought I would give this a try since I saw many good reviews on Amazon... and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** For back/side of my upper arms: WORKS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;It works really well on the skin of my arms. I have lost a lot of weight during the past few months, and I had issues with my skin looking \\&quot;loose\\&quot;... but this product got rid of that in a little over a week. My skin looks and feel tighter for sure. I used this once a day (before I sleep), and used it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** For back of my upper thighs: LITTLE &amp; SLOW results..&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on the back of my legs as I have cellulite problems there, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big change in that area (compared to my arms at least). I feel like the skin is tighter, but then it doesn&#x27;t look like my cellulite is going anywhere... This will probably reduce the looks of cellulite, but I doubt it will get rid of it. I think this works good as a skin tightening cream more than a cream that gets rid of cellulite completely... HOWEVER, it has only been a little more than a week, so it might be too early to give a final conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The look and feel of the product: SMELLS WEIRD, FEELS OILY!&lt;br /&gt;I saw many complaints about the pump of the bottle, but I personally had no issues with it. It&#x27;s in a metal can type of container, so if you pump breaks, I am really not sure how you would get the cream out... Another thing I want to address is the SMELL and FEEL of the cream. I has quite a strong smell, and I don&#x27;t really care for it. The smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant, but it not a deal breaker. After you put on the cream, it feels kinda oily. It takes a WHILE for your skin to absorb the cream... you can pretty much FEEL the cream for at least a good couple hours after... I recommend using it at night before you sleep, and not before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Bottom line: It WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;It tightens your skin. I might not get rid of your cellulite, but it will definitely help reduce the look of your cellulite. If skin tightening is what you are looking for, definitely try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I recently started to put on this lotion and I can see already a change. My skin is very soft and my cellulite are somewhat diminishing, however I have plenty of cellulite so I know it will take a lot more than wearing this lotion to reduce them. My first bottle malfunction,  right away seller answer my email and in two days I received the other bottle. Very happy with this lotion. I recommend this 100 percent, especially for the girls who have less. For those who like me have a lot Of cellulite and laxity i also recommend this lotion with a cellulite cup, a metal rolling  and leg work out because is working great for me. Beauty is pain :0)</li>
            <li> Ive tried a couple things to help my thighs, and this one works. It takes time, and you have to use it about twice a day, but once you do that, youll see results within a month or so. I liked it, and already ordered my second one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have re-ordered numerous times from this same company (quick shipping and nicely packaged). I have tried over 6 different brands of cellulite creams and this one works the best!  I only use organic and natural oils and creams on my skin/face/body, and that is what first attracted me to this cream. Wow!  After 2 uses (2 days) my thighs were baby soft and the cellulite smoothed out within about a week.  I love the smell of it - very light and pleasant... not strong or perfume smelling.  I also have purchased the seaweed scrub, which I use all over my body, and is great on my face since it&#x27;s a fine grain scrub and has natural oils that moisturize also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the body blaster anti cellulite seaweed scrub.  I think using them together has made a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  You must be consistent though to see results.</li>
            <li> Like many other women out there, I have tried every product you can possibly imagine for cellulite treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion twice a day everyday plus exercise and good eating habits, has been a miracle to me. It smells great, it&#x27;s not sticky, and makes my skin feel amazingly soft. I also bought the waterproof massager as well and I use it everyday in the shower .&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend NuElle products! And they are VERY quick to deliver they&#x27;re products as well.</li>
            <li> My legs looked worse than before I started using it. Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> This cream is in one word, Amazing!  I have been using it for about a month now and I can see remarkable results!  My skin is tighter, firmer and there is hardly none and I mean none, cellulite appearance on my thighs or buttock area at all.  I give this cream definitely 5 stars!  It smells great and is also super conditioning and it dries super fast!!!!  I love it!</li>
            <li> this is my second time using this product, and I absolutely vouch for the results. It worked miracles for me, and I have to admit I was not a believer. It not only takes care of cellulite, but smells great and is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is truly amazing!  It actually works if you follow the instructions.  I am in my 40s and recently lost 50 lbs.  My skin didn&#x27;t spring back like it did when I was in my 20s.  I used this product faithfully for two months and was so impressed.  My skin tone improved and my skin tightened up beautifully.  Buy it!  This product does what it says!</li>
            <li> First time I have used an anti cellulite cream, and I am so impressed.  I have noticed positive results after just a few weeks!  Yea!!  I have already placed my second order!</li>
            <li> I tried other stuff for cellulite problem but nothing worked like Nuelle. It feels great, smells wonderful, no oily feeling afterwards. I just love it and started to see results in a couple of weeks. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Barely saw any results, if any.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have some cellulite in the back of my legs and some stretchmarks.. Been using it for about a month and notices a difference in my skin texture and firmness overall I love it def ordering another one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite but I tried this product as skin firming body cream.  I used it around neck (and face - I don&#x27;t know if I am supposed to do it) but skin firming effect is very good.  Lines and slacking on my skin (neck, shoulder and face) from aging are improved.  I am now buying second bottle.  Only negative point is its smell.  It smells like Japanese pepper.  If it smells like rosemary mint or something, it would be more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not only have a noticed a huge change in my cellulite, but this product smells great. I would definitely get this product!</li>
            <li> I got this free and it works. I bike ride and have been using this every night and I see less cellulite on my butt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in firmness and texture of my skin.  The appearance of my cellulite has decreased in only two months.  What makes this product even better is the pleasant smell.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I have a mild amount of cellulite/dimply skin around my thighs but work out 5-6 times a week. No amount of exercise has helped me get rid of my cellulite but after one week I noticed my skin becoming firmer from using this product. Simply use as directed along with regular exercise and you&#x27;ll see results almost instantly. I will definitely buy this again; I love this stuff, it actually works.</li>
            <li> this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, the product feels light yet firming up my skin. will recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product when used and understood properly, and by that I mean understanding what it can and what it can&#x27;t do. It CAN help you loose cellulite, stretch your skin and increase its elasticity while you are on a diet, exercising, drinking plenty of water, massaging the area. It definitely can NOT make you skinny while you are sitting on the couch. But on the other hand I believe no product can do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for almost 2 months now, after each shower, on my thighs and stomach. When I bought it I had set my mind to attack cellulite from all possible angles, after years of living with it. I knew very well from last time I had managed to properly reduce it, that only a combination of factors plus perseverance can make it go away. Therefore I am training for 1-2 hours a day, 5 days a week, have changed my diet to a much healthier one, renounced to late dinners, focused on my water intake, and daily scrubbed and applied the cream. It does work, I have just ordered 3 more bottles, even though I have to pay delivery to Madrid (it is not available in Europe, you guys have it good:) ). Also once per week I apply it after using a dermaroller, this could have helped a lot the absorption of the cream. Give it time, patience and perseverance, I have noticed the first real results after around 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final piece of advice, don&#x27;t place all your eggs in the same basket :). Remember that cellulite is a strong enemy and usually no one thing can beat it. From cream point of view, I recommend this one. And I have tried plenty of them, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been using this product now for 6 months after having tried the vella smooth at American Laser Center which was AWFUL -&gt;&gt; BOOOOOOO to them - I spent over $3500 with them and GOT NOTHING!!  My best friend later on bought me Nivea&#x27;s product as a gift, and of course I saw nothing... plus I didnt like the consistancy.  So then I tried NuElle, with fear that I would lose more money... and soon enough, I actually started feeling a difference after a few weeks when I realized there truly was a visual improvement. YAY!!!!! I continued to use the product and now that I have been using it for a good amount of time I have definitely been able to see and feel the changes, and I can definitely vouch for this miracle in a bottle.  Very very cool.  I really didnt think I had a chance.  This stuff is terrific.  Nivea was garbage and so were the expensive technologies I lost my money on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a GREAT INVESTMENT!!  YAY to NuElle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im buying right now - AGAIN! But this time they deserved a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXOX&lt;br /&gt;YAY!</li>
            <li> Just finished up 2 bottle of this nuelle stuff using it 2x a day, nearly every day since Valentine Day. I also been taking pole-dancing fitness classes 3-4x/week (super fun BTW) so I thought I at least see a little change. It is moisurizing, lightweight and absorb well, but sadly has had no effect on the celluite I have on my legs. Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a month and can say that it delivers results! I have been neglecting myself for quite a while with kids, work and all that, so my body requires a lot of work for improvement. My cellulite has not disappeared completely and I will not try to be delusional and expect that it can happen, but I believe that I see some improvement when it comes to ripple look on the back of my thighs and firmness of the skin. I am pleased with that, since I have not seen any results at all with other cheaper products. I am going to continue using it and buying another one just to be sure that improvement continues. After all I am aware that it will take more than a month or two to see any considerable change. Self-care requires dedication, just like brushing teeth. I like also that this products is so natural because I have read somewhere that accumulation of toxins (aka chemicals) is another reason of cellulite along with other health issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night for about a week now and I can tell a huge difference in the areas with little dimples. Also have been putting it on my double chin, couldn&#x27;t hurt right? Smells like old limes but is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month. It smells great. I also bought and use the Body Massager and the scrub. I have ordered the lotion twice now. I&#x27;m waiting for the results.</li>
            <li> I hate it when a product doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, 120 lbs and very fit. But no matter how much I work out or diet, I can&#x27;t seem to lose the small amount of cottage cheese on my legs. I thought that adding this lotion into my daily routine would be the key but the bottle is now empty and nothing has changed ....Sad.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I love this product along with the scrub. The smell is wonderful and it makes your skin even more soft and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Only been using for about a wk now and have noticed firming a really great product and I will reorder</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this lotion for about 6 months now and love it a lot. Meanwhile  switched back and forth trying others in between and none other even comes close.  Brilliant product, not an overnight cellulite solution, but if you stick with it, you will be happy with results. I also use massager and brushing with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, diet and exercise instead!</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has definetely improved. I have a lot of celullite so I might be fooling myself by thinking this will fix the problem. I will continue to diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> Love the product, love the team that delivers the product as they were so incredibly helpful when I had a problem with the delivery. I would recommend this product to any woman who is looking after her figure in a more natural way. Very good smell, and perfect consistency for a quick massage with no residue. My skin felt firmer after the first few applications. As for cellulite results, I will have to wait for a few weeks to be able to pronounce my verdict. I am certainly going to continue and find out!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.  Leaves skin soft but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference as far as cellulite.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t worked for me and has a very strong smell but it&#x27;s not that bad of a smell.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the PRODUCT if you are developing crinkly skin on upper arms. Despite the fact that this cream was created to ameliorate cellulite, this product goes further beyond. I&#x27;ve have been using this product over 10 months and only after three months of use I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my upper arms, which now seems more tone and less crinkly. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, not greasy, easy to apply.  After a month, twice a day, I seen results, my skin looked better.  Great improvement.  Doesn&#x27;t remove at all, but I will keep using it for another 3 months.  Drink a lot water and do some exercise and control your food, it will help a lot.  Wait for my update in 3 months again.</li>
            <li> Hmmm. Reviews look VERY suspicious and fake</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Try it to believe.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cross between cat pee and lemons. Not sure if it works but the instructions are a mile long on what time of day to use (2x before or after meals, kinda absurd). Just skeptical about this and the smell is just awful.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical of all cellulite products. we all women have cellulite and this is how it is. i received a basket of skin care as birthday gift from my girlfriends and this lotion was a part of it. luckily, i am not diluted about the results that i could expect. but i was unexpectedly surprised. after just a couple of weeks i noticed my skin looking smoother and less rippled. tighter even. i like this lotion and probably will buy more when i finish my bottle.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, es la tercera vez que lo compro, desde que lo uso, mi piel mejoro. Lo recomiendo. Y lo seguir&amp;eacute; usando.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this treatment, but see some improvement already. And what it was, like just a week or so. I haven&#x27;t had much expectations after trying others, but there is hope in cellulite department when it comes to this one. It smells good which is a plus, it feels light and all that deserves 4 stars for now. May update later.</li>
            <li> This is the best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried at lest 3 different cellulite creams and this one is definitely the winner. It does make my cellulite disappear and my skin smoother. It also smells great and absorbs well. I will definitely keep using it and highly recommend anybody who wants to get rid of cellulite to give this product a try. You will not regret!</li>
            <li> This was the first anti-cellulite cream that I have ever bought.  I don&#x27;t use it twice a day as directed but I use it occasionally when I think about it.  I feel that I can see improvement on the cellulite on my legs and it is thick and creamy with a nice clean smell.  I will buy it again and would recommend it to anyone looking for an anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> Great product! It ships really fast and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day with a cellulite brush and along with an intense exercise routine, it has greatly helped me reduce my cellulite. I definite recommend the product, but don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle. You need to work on your diet and exercise as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cram based on all of the great reviews however I have seen no improvement after using an entire container. I find the consistency once put on my skin is tacky, making my clothes stick to me. I also find it very inconvenient to not be able to eat for one hour after as I usually have my shower and eat breakfast afterwards. Overall, very disappointed in this product as I had high hopes that it would work for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has definately helped the cellulite on my butt/thighs.  I have always eaten in moderation, maintained a healthy weight, and exercise 5-6 times per week; but that did not prevent me from inheriting my mom&#x27;s cottage cheese butt/thighs.  After a few weeks of using it twice a day, my skin became smoother and much less dimply.  I tried the Nivea and Finulite creams before, and this one works better!  I also love the smell (smells like a spa) and the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Argania sent me a 5oz complimentary NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate product to test out and review, and I have been pleasantly surprised at my results! Their concentrate boasts 25 of the best cellulite fighting ingredients such as: Caffeine, L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10, Algae+,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel the lotion start to tingle the second I put it on my skin and started rubbing it in. Unlike other cellulite creams, this one had NO offensive odor, and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky at all. In fact, I actually kind of liked the light and natural scent of this concentrate and it made my skin feel really soft after using it. I used it on my upper arms, stomach, and legs and bum, applying it at least once a day in the evenings, but twice a day when I could remember, and started noticing that the areas seemed tighter and more even after around 2 weeks, and by 4 weeks there was definitely a noticable difference!</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the product when i first got it but then the company sent me another one to try again, but unfortunately i dont like this product, the smell makes me sick, it smells like fish, i tried to avoid the smell in hopes of it working but unfortunately saw no results(i eat clean and exercise)</li>
            <li> I have tried about 3-4 cellulite creams/lotions/gels over the years and this is by far the most effective.  I use it once a day after my shower.  I also use the anti cellulite scrub in the shower almost daily.  After a few weeks I started seeing a noticeable difference in my thighs.  I just ordered my 2nd bottle of the lotion and scrub.  I&#x27;m excited to continue to use the products and see just how great my legs can look!</li>
            <li> The first smell I smelled when I put it on was aloe. I remember when you burned myself and well my grandma would grab the aloe plant to put some on a cut or burn. Then it magically felt better and healed faster. Well at least with me it did. That is what  the smell reminds me of. One of the first ingredients is water and then aloe juices. Even after I put it on 30 minutes ago my skin feels smoother. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as rough and dry. I would suggest this for a woman after she has had children. It does suggest not using it while pregnant I would suggest this for men who just like to reduce their cellulite. The bottle you get is huge. I have seen some that are so itty bitty and I am like really for that price and that much. Nope give me something that will last some time. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product and i don&#x27;t think i will ever use anything else , it makes my skin look and feel smother and tighter .Its really an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have used it since January and have seen dramatic results. I encourage those of you who are looking for a way to fight cellulite to try this product. The seller is awesome, I&#x27;ve received all my orders on time or earlier than expected. Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month, I already see a reduction in the cellulite on my thighs. I just ordered another bottle. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve seen improvement. After the first week, you start noticing the difference. I loved the results and I&#x27;m even buying this product for my mother now. We both love it. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. I have ordered it twice now. I see results for sure, and the product arrived 8 days prior to estimated delivery date. I highly recommend! &#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it as recommended twice a day. It last for 3 weeks and after 10 days I saw results.I am not big fan of the smell but for smooth skin I will do anything:) I will recommend this product to anyone. It is affordable and it works. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it... Big difference in 2 weeks, I will buy it again!!! I have purchased the Skin QR Organics L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz twice already, and it has made a huge difference.  My skin is smoother then ever, and find no need to use daily lotions either. I also realized that some of the cellulite is vanishing. I have used NuElle products for the last six months, and I have already recommended this product to my family and friends and would strongly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10, 125 lbs, size 2, but CANNOT get the cellulite to diminish on the back of my thighs.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every product on the market, expensive/cheap/midgrade, and this is the only one that seems to work.  I use this in combination with a coffee scrub and dry brushing- and the results are visible within two weeks. I will be purchasing this for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4-6 weeks. While the results aren&#x27;t drastic, I&#x27;m confident I can tell a difference. The smell is surprisingly pleasant and the lotion feels like any other lotion (no weird tingling). Pleased so far!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to remove your cellulite, then this product works wonders. After using this product, my skin look much better and healthier.</li>
            <li> This is my third time purchasing this product. With so many on the market I really did my research and I&#x27;m glad I did. For the cost I absolutely love this product. It does what it says. Within a week of use you will see a noticeable difference. It smells great and the feel is not greasy or oily. It seems to work for me :)</li>
