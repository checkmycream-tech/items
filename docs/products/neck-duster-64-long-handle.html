            <li>Should have bought a better one.</li>
            <li>but I am also not a barber it does and ok job at dusting necks.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with this product,it is helpful when she cuts my hair to clean my neck ,it is very soft.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a great neck duster if you&#x27;re looking for a professional quality one.  </li>
            <li>They fall out during each use, pay more money and get a better brush trust me it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>The bristles stay one strong and gets rid off all the hair.</li>
            <li>It works great, does not loose bristles.</li>
            <li>It feels really cheap and isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s just cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to clean my saxophone.  </li>
            <li>Brush is good to go &amp; gets the hair off but the bristles are falling out after only 1 use.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice soft brush, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Quality of the brush seems really cheap, would tell someone to buy another and not this one, there are much more which are probably better for the same price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad brush, it&#x27;s just not a neck brush.</li>
            <li>This is such a handy little tool when you give as many haircuts as I do each month with a husband and 3 sons. :)</li>
            <li>This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast.</li>
            <li>Nice, not very large.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for cleaning all the hard to get to areas on an instrument.  </li>
            <li>The bristle portion of this brush is nowhere near as full as the photo would leave you to believe.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s real boar bristle</li>
            <li>very sparse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that can really brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I will be returning very soon.</li>
            <li>but feels kind of small.</li>
            <li>very soft on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Clearly this is NOT a barbershop quality brush.</li>
            <li>Picture shows fluffy full bristled brush.  </li>
            <li>I try to get him new items as often as possible.</li>
            <li>a major investment, granted</li>
            <li>The image here makes it look like the bristles are pretty dense and there are a lot of them, but it&#x27;s far less than it appears.</li>
            <li>My memories of the barbershop of my youth is that the neck brush was a soft and soothing finish to my haircuts; this is the polar opposite.</li>

            <li> Got tired of using my wifes makeup brush, with the long bristles I can reach the back of my neck easily.  </li>
            <li> my hair cutting machine came with a very cheap brush which actually hurt to use&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> This is a lot smaller than I expected Should read the reviews before Buying.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as fluffy and soft as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit too long for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted the long handle, but the bristles are really long, too.</li>
            <li> saved my neck from my wife and the rough brush she was using,.</li>
            <li> Very small and only useable for cleaning the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Also, the boar bristles are just too stiff for my liking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the small side.</li>
            <li> Small number of bristles make for a small diameter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned some in the past</li>
            <li> Too small for the money</li>
            <li> This brush has a skinny, skimpy tuft of very stiff boar hair whose ends are not trimmed to a uniform length.</li>
            <li> Reality is minimal hairs in brush making it virtually useless for purpose intended i.e. powder dusting a person neck.  </li>
            <li> No more Angry Bird Brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been behind the chair since 2002.</li>
            <li> it is quite unpleasant.</li>

            <li> No more Angry Bird Brush. LoL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the small side. I guess I was expecting something a bit bigger around. This Neck Duster is of good quality though.</li>
            <li> They fall out during each use, pay more money and get a better brush trust me it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a lot smaller than I expected Should read the reviews before Buying.</li>
            <li> Stylish, lots of bristles, well made.</li>
            <li> Brush is good to go &amp; gets the hair off but the bristles are falling out after only 1 use.</li>
            <li> This is a great neck duster if you&#x27;re looking for a professional quality one.  Bristles are sturdy and it does it&#x27;s job well.  It makes a great gift if you have someone in your life who likes to have nice grooming supplies.</li>
            <li> Works great for removing hair after a haircut.</li>
            <li> I use it for sweeping the hairs off our naked bodies after using the clippers for our monthly haircuts.</li>
            <li> This is the skinniest neck brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s probably only about 1\\&quot; in diameter.  I&#x27;ll take their word for it that it&#x27;s real boar bristle but the ends are all raggedy and the bristles very sparse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather have had synthetic bristles and a brush that can really brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not a major investment, granted but now I have to order another and after this experience don&#x27;t trust the pictures here on Amazon.com any more.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as fluffy and soft as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to clean my saxophone.  This brush is great for cleaning all the hard to get to areas on an instrument.  Keeps instrument cleaner and doesn&#x27;t scratch it.</li>
            <li> Nice, not very large. I have been using it for a long time. It works great, does not loose bristles. I&#x27;ve been behind the chair since 2002.</li>
            <li> This is such a handy little tool when you give as many haircuts as I do each month with a husband and 3 sons. :)</li>
            <li> Very small and only useable for cleaning the clippers.  This is not a neck duster.</li>
            <li> Actual item not as per picture shown.  Picture shows fluffy full bristled brush.  Reality is minimal hairs in brush making it virtually useless for purpose intended i.e. powder dusting a person neck.  Supplier and Amazon should be ashamed of selling such junk.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice soft brush, and does the job.  It is more professional than my daughter wafting a towel after cutting hair, or using her hand.  It is nicely made.  I love the wood handle. So many things are plastic these days.</li>
            <li> My brother loves this brush. He cuts all the guys in my family. I try to get him new items as often as possible. He likes it a lot.  Thanks for a great</li>
            <li> Good to have. Should have bought a better one.</li>
            <li> what can I say its a neck duster the quality isnt great but I am also not a barber it does and ok job at dusting necks.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is NOT a barbershop quality brush. It is very cheap and also sheds. I will be returning very soon.</li>
            <li> my hair cutting machine came with a very cheap brush which actually hurt to use&lt;br /&gt;this brush works well &amp; is gentel on the neck</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This brush has a skinny, skimpy tuft of very stiff boar hair whose ends are not trimmed to a uniform length. The sensation of having one&#x27;s neck brushed with it is quite unpleasant. My memories of the barbershop of my youth is that the neck brush was a soft and soothing finish to my haircuts; this is the polar opposite. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit too long for me. I wanted the long handle, but the bristles are really long, too. The image here makes it look like the bristles are pretty dense and there are a lot of them, but it&#x27;s far less than it appears. It feels really cheap and isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Quality of the brush seems really cheap, would tell someone to buy another and not this one, there are much more which are probably better for the same price.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t do a good job brushing hair off the neck and face. I prefer a brush that has shorter bristles and a wider area of coverage. It works, but not how I want it to work</li>
            <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Small number of bristles make for a small diameter. Also, the boar bristles are just too stiff for my liking. It&#x27;s not a bad brush, it&#x27;s just not a neck brush. Might just use it for some painting.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this product,it is helpful when she cuts my hair to clean my neck ,it is very soft.I like when my wife uses this.</li>
            <li> The bristle portion of this brush is nowhere near as full as the photo would leave you to believe.  However, it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> perfect, just what i was looking for !</li>
            <li> The bristles stay one strong and gets rid off all the hair. I&#x27;ve owned some in the past and I was having to make 4 or 5 swipes and there would still buy hair. Not this one, two passes and the hair is off the neck.</li>
            <li> Got tired of using my wifes makeup brush, with the long bristles I can reach the back of my neck easily.  Good quailty.</li>
            <li> saved my neck from my wife and the rough brush she was using,. very soft on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Zero stars! Too small for the money &amp; it&#x27;s just cheap looking.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s okay but feels kind of small.</li>
