            <li>and since it was a great price, I purchased 2; however, I wish I had bought more.  </li>
            <li>Nice assortment of products in the box .</li>
            <li>The set arrived in tact and made for a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I just wish I would have shopped around for a better package that came with the ea de parfum roller, but I still love the smell!</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, very light scent.  </li>
            <li>Love the trio combo, the smell is fantastic !</li>
            <li>Love this smell and how it lingers</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely gift set with perfume, lotion and shower gel.</li>
            <li>this was purchased for my wife she love the fragrance and smell</li>
            <li>,i love the body lotion</li>
            <li>Not only was it the best deal I had seen on the internet, but it also was the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of her perfumes</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I dont mind buying another one at all. :)</li>

            <li>Smells amazing and came exactly as the picture is shown.</li>
            <li>At first I wasnt sure it was the real thing, because the price was so good.</li>
            <li>and I know my sis will enjoy this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super excited</li>
            <li>However, Perfumania shipped this extremely quickly; I got it three days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I think it will now be added to my favorite list of fragrances as I have many (Initial by Boucheron; Angel; Euphoria; Samsara; Michael Kors; Marc Jacobs;</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, but when I received it, the scent is great floral yet sexy smell, that last long.</li>
            <li>The bottles are a nice size, especially for the price and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>after about ten minutes it fades to a nice rose smell but at first it smells like tortillas and roses mixed together.</li>
            <li>arrived super fast, on time.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love extra goodies.</li>
            <li>Got it for my wife for X-mas, she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Got so many complaints on this scent and it lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the price will be just as reasonable.</li>
            <li>I should be more careful of when to send perfumes.</li>
            <li>This perfume was brand new, which was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was half filled.</li>
            <li>Its not really sweet smelling, its a very mature and professional scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Received package in a timely manner.  Impressed with scent which lasts majority of the day. I am going to search for the red bottle version of this fragrance.  Hopefully the price will be just as reasonable.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and came exactly as the picture is shown. Love the trio combo, the smell is fantastic ! Best perfume smell ever</li>
            <li> This perfume was brand new, which was exactly as described.  I just wish I would have shopped around for a better package that came with the ea de parfum roller, but I still love the smell!</li>
            <li> I received the Item late, opened and half empty. someone used it and put it back into the broken box the perfume bottle was half empty W.T.F? could not beleive it</li>
            <li> My 30 y/o diva niece loved it. Christmas gift . Fancy box and design. Diva name on the box. Nice assortment of products in the box . She hasn&#x27;t given any negative feed back yet. The material must be good also.</li>
            <li> This perfume has an intoxicating blend of florals and musk that leaves a spicy but not overpowering seductive fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t knock you in the face but begs the question of coming close to smell the fragrance.  It lasts through the evening.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and how it lingers</li>
            <li> arrived super fast, on time. Very good product and is the largest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   My wife is happy.&lt;br /&gt;Soon be buying another as a gift.</li>
            <li> Second purchase of this fragrance.  My wife simply loves it!  Not overpowering, very light scent.  Very excellent price point !</li>

            <li> this perfume smells terrible when you first spray it. after about ten minutes it fades to a nice rose smell but at first it smells like tortillas and roses mixed together. The lotion is horrible its way to strong and doesn&#x27;t fade at all. i would like this perfume alot more if it smelled good when i first sprayed it. but im giving it two stars because it smells good after awhile but although i will finish using this product i wont be buying it again.</li>
