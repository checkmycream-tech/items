            <li>If you are looking for a little more then just your mascara</li>
            <li>Red Cherry Lashes are so worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are long and full.</li>
            <li>But better to be too long and trim than to be too short and have to trash them.</li>
            <li>they live up to the product description 100%.  </li>
            <li>Look very natural.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use long lasting</li>
            <li>They look naturally but they make your lashes look thicker and longer!</li>
            <li>Clean them properly and take care of them and they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>Some people thought they were my natural lashses</li>
            <li>I got these lashes because I wanted something that looked natural yet glamorous.</li>
            <li>These lashes look so natural.</li>
            <li>These look natural and they make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural.</li>
            <li>they lool natural</li>
            <li>natural and flirty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lengthy but natural and wispy looking as well.</li>
            <li>The band is super thin and almost invisible but yet super durable.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and the band is thin</li>
            <li>Matter a fact no one knows I have fake on they are by far the most natural and stay on the longest .</li>
            <li>Ill never wear another kind again.</li>
            <li>And what I really love is that the band is thin</li>
            <li>These are way too long to appear natural, they are some of the longest lashes I have ever work!</li>

            <li> Haha luckily, you still get the quality but with a decent price tag</li>
            <li> I loved these lashes on me, but up close they kind of looked crazy and untamed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They look so real</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re fun, and still kinda natural looking.</li>

            <li> Very lightweight and realistic looking</li>
            <li> Very natural!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a little more then just your mascara</li>
            <li> Red Cherry Lashes are so worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are long and full.</li>
            <li> But better to be too long and trim than to be too short and have to trash them.</li>
            <li> they live up to the product description 100%.  </li>
            <li> Look very natural.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use long lasting</li>
            <li> They look naturally but they make your lashes look thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> Clean them properly and take care of them and they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Some people thought they were my natural lashses</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because I wanted something that looked natural yet glamorous.</li>
            <li> These lashes look so natural.</li>
            <li> These look natural and they make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> they lool natural</li>
            <li> natural and flirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lengthy but natural and wispy looking as well.</li>
            <li> The band is super thin and almost invisible but yet super durable.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and the band is thin</li>
            <li> Matter a fact no one knows I have fake on they are by far the most natural and stay on the longest .</li>
            <li> Ill never wear another kind again.</li>
            <li> And what I really love is that the band is thin</li>
            <li> These are way too long to appear natural, they are some of the longest lashes I have ever work!</li>
            <li> These are honestly the only false eyelashes I continue to order excessively.</li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes, but sometimes, just want the glamor of the false ones, These are great for night time, and day, they also have a wispy quality that I like in my false eyelashes</li>
            <li> These lashes are about a million miles long and don&#x27;t look even a little bit realistic.</li>
            <li> They are long enough that they blend with your eyelashes, but not too long that you look theatrical in the &amp;#34;bad way&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> long enough though</li>
            <li> They are long but not too obvious - they don&#x27;t look like falsies.  </li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is you have to be extra careful taking them out of the package.</li>
            <li> and I have used a single pair daily for over a month.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing false eyelashes pretty regularly for years now and there is NO comparison to Red Cherry.</li>
            <li> They are not overly long in either width or length.</li>
            <li> *  not to  long</li>
            <li> Like, all the way to my eyebrows long.</li>
            <li> As long as you pick the correct number/style</li>
            <li> They feel very light and don&#x27;t bother my eyes like other ones that tend to weigh down my lid and are uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are nice, not too thick but a little dramatic for my taste.  </li>
            <li> looked like plastic eye lashes, I understand of course its not real hair</li>
            <li> It is what im expected</li>
            <li> They are dramatic, in a very Audrey Hepburn, Zooey Deschanel way, so it&#x27;s wearable for a day to day</li>
            <li> The band is very very thin and that is the trick with the right amount of lashes .</li>
            <li> So why not pay half price for red cherry lashes and just wait a few days for your lashes to come in the mail</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other styles.  </li>
            <li> They look much too fake.  </li>
            <li> I trimmed them because they are too long for my small</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes everyday and the brand I wear look very natural.  </li>
            <li> My search is over, I will now be sticking with these little beauties.</li>
            <li> WSP are an everyday look for me - not too thick but still slightly tapered</li>
            <li> The band is so flexible and I hardly notice them when I have them on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of lashes with thick bands.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that these bad boys are loooonnggg.</li>
            <li> I thought the wisp lashes would be fluffy but subtle, and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too bad that I won&#x27;t be getting any use out of these drag queen flutter lashes.</li>
            <li> These are just  not as noticeable to me and when I wear them, on my eyes they look weird.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here,,&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> These are incredible eyelashes! They&#x27;re natural yet full and they&#x27;re the perfect length for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Truly like these lashes. They are not overly long in either width or length. They have that whispy look and are not uniform as to look more natural. Hold up well</li>
            <li> Great lashes. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> Alot of people seem to love these and they are good in my opinion, but I don&#x27;t like these over Ardell. These are just  not as noticeable to me and when I wear them, on my eyes they look weird. They are a pair you have to try for yourself to determine  if you would like them.</li>
            <li> these are great quality &amp; even came witha  hand written note.  i gave some to my mom and i am able to reuse when i take care of them i don&#x27;t buy my eyelashes anywhere else.  great price and great service . highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes! they look so real, they hold up well, are light, keep their shape and shipped pretty fast. I am beyond pleased with this product and my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love how natural these lashes look. The band is super thin and almost invisible but yet super durable. I&#x27;ve been wearing the same pair for about 3 weeks now and they have not gotten crinkly or deformed. Red Cherry Lashes are so worth the price.</li>
            <li> By FAR the best lashes I have EVER used.  My search is over, I will now be sticking with these little beauties.</li>
            <li> Easy to use long lasting</li>
            <li> These are honestly the only false eyelashes I continue to order excessively. They are so beautiful and natural looking. I absolutely love these kind of Red Cherry lashes, they are a must have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using red cherry 43 for aomg time. I just happen to come across these and they are my new favorite. There look amazing and full.</li>
            <li> Get compliments ALLLL of the time. They look so real and I have used a single pair daily for over a month. Clean them properly and take care of them and they&#x27;ll last. Awesome quality</li>
            <li> looked like plastic eye lashes, I understand of course its not real hair but it still shouldn&#x27;t shine like plastic</li>
            <li> they live up to the product description 100%.  they look gorgeous and I immediately received compliments.  Some people thought they were my natural lashses which is what I was going for so that made me very happy.  I will definitely purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> red cherry lashes are just perfect... ordered some a while ago and had to reorder cuz they are the bombdiggy! they are reusable and very light weight, forgot i had them on... easy to apply! i trimmed the longer strands just because i wear lashes in the day and didnt want that big lash effect! perfect u get them</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the drips to look like individual more then strips then these are the ones. Matter a fact no one knows I have fake on they are by far the most natural and stay on the longest . The band is very very thin and that is the trick with the right amount of lashes .</li>
            <li> I own and continue to reorder the Red Cherry line. Hands down the best when it comes to quality, looks, &amp; durability. WSP are an everyday look for me - not too thick but still slightly tapered so you get the flirty lashes on the outer corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont hesitate to buy any of their line! You will never go back to store bought lashes!</li>
            <li> These lashes are such great quality and so inexpensive. These pair in particular are my very favorite, natural but a lot of volume and length. They feel very light and don&#x27;t bother my eyes like other ones that tend to weigh down my lid and are uncomfortable. They arrived very very quickly, i was very impressed. So happy, really recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect lash for me and these come pretty close! I have been wearing false eyelashes pretty regularly for years now and there is NO comparison to Red Cherry. I got these lashes because I wanted something that looked natural yet glamorous. These are way too long to appear natural, they are some of the longest lashes I have ever work! The whispyness creates more of a natural and free look. The thin band on Red Cherry eyelashes makes for easy application, and they really are top-notch quality.</li>
            <li> I have hooded lids and these lashes open up my eyes so well. I sleep with them on and nothing happens.</li>
            <li> These are high quality eyelashes, and honestly may never get another brand!  They are long enough that they blend with your eyelashes, but not too long that you look theatrical in the &amp;#34;bad way&amp;#34;.  I have very long eyelashes, but sometimes, just want the glamor of the false ones, These are great for night time, and day, they also have a wispy quality that I like in my false eyelashes, I think they look more natural.  LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> These lashes look so natural. SOOOOOO much better than the Ardell brand. Ive always heard people talk about his brand and decided to try it for myself...I will probably never wear another brand again :) I have large oval eyes and other brands are ALWAYS TOO short (never fails), but these fit great!!!</li>
            <li> I loved these lashes on me, but up close they kind of looked crazy and untamed!&lt;br /&gt;But they&#x27;re fun, and still kinda natural looking. They were super comfortable and I will def re-buy!</li>
            <li> Although I heard raves about these lashes, I don&#x27;t care for them.  They look much too fake.  I wear false lashes everyday and the brand I wear look very natural.  I can only use the Red Cherry ones perhpas in the evening, but not daily.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what I ordered and I was pissed. Plus I noticed I didn&#x27;t like these wispy lashes they&#x27;re not noticeable enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> OMG! I am in LOVE with my new lashes. who knew there was such a great product at such an affordable price?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Buy these lashes you won&#x27;t regret it. They are the best and look very natural on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the wsp love all the red cherries,  now I will try the dw smaller version of this one</li>
            <li> Once again a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> as how they describe it and same exact thing as how it is on the picture i love them i cant wait to try them on</li>
            <li> I love these lashes*  not to  long ** and not fake looking*  ... long enough though ~ I just reordered them again*</li>
            <li> These look natural and they make your eyes pop. They are long and full. They are the perfect everyday and going out lashes I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! They look naturally but they make your lashes look thicker and longer! I get compliments every time i wear them.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are dramatic, in a very Audrey Hepburn, Zooey Deschanel way, so it&#x27;s wearable for a day to day look if that&#x27;s your style. I have smaller eyes than these lovely ladies, but I just adore how girly they are.</li>
            <li> I remember when red cherries were the over priced Brand name lashes. Haha luckily, you still get the quality but with a decent price tag</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and realistic looking</li>
            <li> I thought the wisp lashes would be fluffy but subtle, and boy was I wrong. These lashes are about a million miles long and don&#x27;t look even a little bit realistic. Girls who want drama, this is your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is fine: the lash band is soft, it&#x27;s relatively easy to work with, and it doesn&#x27;t warp upon the first use. It&#x27;s just too bad that I won&#x27;t be getting any use out of these drag queen flutter lashes. Would be sexy if I piled on the eyeliner and didn&#x27;t wear my glasses, but there&#x27;s just nothing remotely realistic about these.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes and it came really fast</li>
            <li> These are some of the best priced, natural looking lashes you could ever own. My only complaint is that these bad boys are loooonnggg. Like, all the way to my eyebrows long. Which is great for a night out, but everyday use to just enhance your natural lashes? No. It might be a pro to some people, but it just means extra work for me, trying to trim them the length I want them. But better to be too long and trim than to be too short and have to trash them. All around, they are very good quality and can last 5-10 wears, depending on how well you take care of them.</li>
            <li> Great lashes will definitely buy again. Looks very nice on. Very light weight and the band is thin so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> These lashes are absolutely gorgeous, they give you such a sexy look to your makeup. Ill never wear another kind again. so easy to apply and so soft!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here,,&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are REAL red cherry lashes, the same brand you can buy for twice the price in stores. As long as you pick the correct number/style your getting exactly what you want. So why not pay half price for red cherry lashes and just wait a few days for your lashes to come in the mail.. Will buy again</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural feeling and they look amazing. Red Cherry was recommended to me by a close friend and she was totally right! They are the best ones out there . I can&#x27;t wait to try the other styles.  It gave me great volume without it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I love them. They are beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This brand.</li>
            <li> Original ones! loved it</li>
            <li> Crappy made my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes I&#x27;m a lash snob and wear them every day, most lashes you get in store&#x27;s cost almost 3 times more and not as good, I always buy in bulk for better deals, if you go to re cherry Web site you can see they are 7.00 a piece, hear 1.70 each big difference.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite type of lashes! So beautiful and simple. Yet they can be wore to add an extra omf to any look. The band is so flexible and I hardly notice them when I have them on. Client favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and light feel of these. These feel and look great. Very natural! I am very very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. If you are looking for a little more then just your mascara then these are perfect .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist so im always looking for full lashes and these are perfect !! I will be ordering more lashes from you guys</li>
            <li> Look very natural.  Great for evening wear.  I trimmed them because they are too long for my small eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural lash! I&#x27;ve already ordered several of these. The price is excellent as well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only gripe I have is you have to be extra careful taking them out of the package. With great care this lash can be used over and over. I use them for myself and clients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing lashes thank you</li>
            <li> These lashes are so beautiful i don&#x27;t regret buying them i definitely recommend these! they lool natural and they don&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eyelashes.  They are long but not too obvious - they don&#x27;t look like falsies.  The pairs are always the same excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear these almost every day.  The price is great, too because I can get many wears out of one pair if I am careful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 1/3 of the price of Ardell&#x27;s from Target or Sally and SOOO much better. Longer band, which fits my eye much better, also the graduation of the length of the lashes looks more flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These make me feel very pretty. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these. Not exaggerated and still photograph beautifully for bridal makeup. Great for women that do not wear lashes on a regular basis and want glamour!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than ardell wispies and much much more natural looking!</li>
            <li> These are nice, not too thick but a little dramatic for my taste.  Definitely something you would wear on a night out!! I&#x27;d suggest the DW (Demi Whispies) for daily wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like these especially in comparison to the others they look super cheap! would not recommend at all!</li>
            <li> Its like normal hair i love it</li>
            <li> I like them they look gorgeous on eyes and the price is good</li>
            <li> some of the best wispies on the market. natural and flirty.</li>
            <li> These are by far my most favorite natural looking lashes.  The give a great daytime look that really open your eyes.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t pick these for a night time look. I&#x27;ve had many compliments with these and have fooled manay people thinking they were real.  And what I really love is that the band is thin so it gives it even more of a realistic look.  I&#x27;m not a fan of lashes with thick bands.</li>
            <li> It is what im expected</li>
            <li> Trail and error purchasing lashes on Amazon.  This is one of the few I&#x27;ve really liked.</li>
            <li> I really love the Red Cherry #WSP style. It&#x27;s lengthy but natural and wispy looking as well. Ultimately it provides that eyelash extension look but in 2 minutes instead of an hour. Plus it&#x27;s so much more affordable!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and look natural!</li>
