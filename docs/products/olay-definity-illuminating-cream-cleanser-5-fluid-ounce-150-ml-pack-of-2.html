            <li>I LOVE THE DEFINITY FOAM CLEANSER!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>It is creamy with granules and smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice cleanser.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, it foams up good</li>
            <li>..infact, it aggravated my acne, causing an even greater break out!</li>
            <li>Perhaps on someone with drier skin, though, it may be more effective.</li>
            <li>I have had oily skin most of my life so have always leaned toward washing my face with soap and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love that feeling.</li>
            <li>I also find the light, clean scent pleasant although I can see where it might not be for everyone&#x27;s taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but the top does not come off.  </li>
            <li>/drop the top in the shower or elsewhere since the top stays on the tube.  </li>
            <li>It gets my skin very clean and leaves it feeling moist (but not oily).</li>
            <li>Some creamy cleansers have too much soap in them and have burned my nose, but this one is just as pleasant as can be.  </li>
            <li>u will shine like the true beauty u are!</li>
            <li>The most refershing face clean</li>
            <li>It has a fine abrasive grit to it</li>
            <li>This cleanser is really nice, your skin feels very hydrated after using, for me I don&#x27;t always have to use lotion after washing with this.</li>
            <li>this not only does a great job of concealing blemishes</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been loyal to Oil of Olay, but now I&#x27;m even more loyal to the Definity line products.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my face doesn&#x27;t reall feel as clean as it should.</li>
            <li>It rinses off clean</li>
            <li>Your face feels clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li>This product is better for persons living in a much cooler climate.</li>
            <li>The Definity foaming cleanser has the same microbeads, but the foam does a much better job of leaving my skin feeling very smooth, clean and fresh with no heaviness.</li>
            <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling fresh and clean like</li>
            <li>One nice thing is you never loose</li>
            <li>Feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products that cost 2-3 times as much and my skin just didn&#x27;t agree with those as much as it did with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It looks good, but from a practical day-to-day perspective, it&#x27;s annoying at best.</li>
            <li>the cream cleanser seems to leave a residue whereas the FOAM leaves my skin almost squeeky clean and it look fresh like a brand new palate for my Definity Foam moisturizer and make up!!</li>
            <li>however they&#x27;re very gentle while still doing the job.</li>
            <li>the funny thing is that my mother lovedd beauty products, and so she had everything in our bathroom cabinet ranging from aveeno products, to dove, and mary kay, as well as olay products.</li>
            <li>You turn the top to open it</li>
            <li>I know my face is soft and feels clean.</li>
            <li>Certainly not enough to keep from buying the product if I liked it enough, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>This product really helps remove all the dirt and makes me feel clean and clear.</li>
            <li>The concave cap means that the cleanser is up against the outside of the cap rather than transferring easily from inside the bottle to your fingertips.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>There is a hole in the center of the silver metallic top.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t think of anything that I don&#x27;t like about this product.</li>
            <li>got the whole regiment for my skin type..</li>
            <li>If you live in a hot and humid climate like I do, it is too greasy.</li>
            <li>To close the product turn the top the other direction and tighten.  </li>
            <li>I have so much more confidence being around other people now.</li>
            <li>Whenever I tried cream cleansers my face never felt clean and my skin too oily a short time after wasing.</li>
            <li>It really has left my skin feeling much more hydrated and smooth after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am older (50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>The exfoliating is very gentle and not the harsh large gritty stuff that many exfoliating cleansers use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for daily use, however I still need to exfoliate every few days w/a more serious product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, creamy product with tiny micro beads that gently whisk away make-up and dead skin to reveal a smoother complexion.</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that&#x27;s worth every bit of money I spend on it.</li>
            <li>I loved it while I used it and if my current venture in skincare fails to produce results I&#x27;ll go back to Oil of Olay for sure and would always recommend this as a reasonable priced skincare product</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the thing I disliked most is the way the cleanser is dispensed.</li>
            <li>It comes in a tube but not your normal squeeze tube.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Definity is gentle enough for my sensitive, dry skin and adds a hint of shine making it look healthy and youthful.</li>
            <li>Once opened you squeeze the tube and the product come out through the small hole in the top.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of clean skin after a shower and typically I don&#x27;t acheive this without the use of a cloth.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft that the only problem is I want to touch it too much.  </li>
            <li>I have some uneven coloration on my face and after a couple weeks of daily use I have noticed a more even tone across my check bones.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed and not tight after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is the difficulty in locating it sometimes in local drugstores, but thanks to Amazon, it was still available on-line.</li>
            <li>Its leaves skin hydrated and soft enough</li>

            <li> Its leaves skin hydrated and soft enough</li>
            <li> sooooo I am in the crazy teenage stage where acne appears and is dreaded the most..</li>
            <li> and now that I&#x27;ve figured out how long it takes me to use 2 tubes I never run out and don&#x27;t have to go to the store to shop for it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily or dry skin, so I can not speak on how well this product adresses those issues.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does not foam up which is preferable to me because foaming cleansers tend to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am age 54 and have combination skin(oily and dry)</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> closed again.</li>
            <li> My skin is just rather average, not particularly oily or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this cream cleanser in place of a bar or other beauty cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who also prefers the Olay Definity foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> Also, recent health issues have made my skin appear dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy with little exfoliating granules.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry which is not helped by the fact that I spend at least six months of the year living/working in a desert climate.</li>
            <li> but now i am having trouble finding the FOAM..</li>
            <li> A small amount of product does come out when you close the product but in my case I&#x27;ve gotten used to that and just squeeze out a little less to start with.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice, creamy product with tiny micro beads that gently whisk away make-up and dead skin to reveal a smoother complexion. Works great with the day and night moisturizers and illuminating eye cream.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE DEFINITY FOAM CLEANSER!! the cream one does not even come close...but now i am having trouble finding the FOAM..WHY? the cream cleanser seems to leave a residue whereas the FOAM leaves my skin almost squeeky clean and it look fresh like a brand new palate for my Definity Foam moisturizer and make up!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well.  I like the way it cleans my face.  Feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I was leary about using a cleanser without a wash cloth, but this cleanser does the job. I like the feel of clean skin after a shower and typically I don&#x27;t acheive this without the use of a cloth. I had been using Olay&#x27;s pre-soaped cleansing cloths. They also work great. I have some uneven coloration on my face and after a couple weeks of daily use I have noticed a more even tone across my check bones. I don&#x27;t have oily or dry skin, so I can not speak on how well this product adresses those issues. I know my face is soft and feels clean.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin most of my life so have always leaned toward washing my face with soap and a wash cloth. Whenever I tried cream cleansers my face never felt clean and my skin too oily a short time after wasing. Now that I am older (50&#x27;s) my skin is not as oily and soap is drying it out. So, I thought I would again try a cream cleanser. Olay Deifinity Illuminating Cream Cleanser seems to be just about perfect. It gets my skin very clean and leaves it feeling moist (but not oily). I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I like the microbeads that gently exfoliate, but the cream leaves my skin with a heavy gunky feeling.  The Definity foaming cleanser has the same microbeads, but the foam does a much better job of leaving my skin feeling very smooth, clean and fresh with no heaviness.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream cleaner for face this is the second time i ordered this cream when i run out i will reorder</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It is creamy with granules and smells very nice.  Some creamy cleansers have too much soap in them and have burned my nose, but this one is just as pleasant as can be.  Only complaint is the difficulty in locating it sometimes in local drugstores, but thanks to Amazon, it was still available on-line.</li>
            <li> If you live in a hot and humid climate like I do, it is too greasy. After using this product, my face doesn&#x27;t reall feel as clean as it should. This product is better for persons living in a much cooler climate.</li>
            <li> I did Olay&#x27;s evaluation online and was advised to try Olay Definity Illuminating cleanserfor my age 40 and over skin.  It really has left my skin feeling much more hydrated and smooth after just a few uses.  It has a fine abrasive grit to it so I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s exfolliating my skin.  It rinses off clean but I wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so, um, frangrancy.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is really nice, your skin feels very hydrated after using, for me I don&#x27;t always have to use lotion after washing with this. Its leaves skin hydrated and soft enough that you don&#x27;t always have to add anything extra. The scent is nice, it foams up good and I have noticed my skin looks healthier overall since using. Great product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes all dirt and buildup off the face without leaving it feeling dehydrated. It makes your face feel rejuvenated. I love that feeling. I finally found a product that&#x27;s worth every bit of money I spend on it. I will not go back to anything else. I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve always been loyal to Oil of Olay, but now I&#x27;m even more loyal to the Definity line products. I will not stray. You must use this product no matter what skin type you have!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s creamy with little exfoliating granules.  My skin feels refreshed and not tight after cleansing.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this shiz every day and my skin looks awesome. I&#x27;ve used many products that cost 2-3 times as much and my skin just didn&#x27;t agree with those as much as it did with this stuff. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cleanser. It&#x27;s creamy with tiny exfoliating beads....however they&#x27;re very gentle while still doing the job. It&#x27;s great for daily use, however I still need to exfoliate every few days w/a more serious product.</li>
            <li> I like this cream cleanser in place of a bar or other beauty cleansers.  It is creamy and lighweight but cleanses thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry which is not helped by the fact that I spend at least six months of the year living/working in a desert climate. Also, recent health issues have made my skin appear dull. The Olay Definity is gentle enough for my sensitive, dry skin and adds a hint of shine making it look healthy and youthful. This cleanser does not foam up which is preferable to me because foaming cleansers tend to dry out my skin. I also find the light, clean scent pleasant although I can see where it might not be for everyone&#x27;s taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside note: About twice a week I also use [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist MicroDermabrasion and Peel Kit]]to exfoliate and the combination has worked well.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd tube I&#x27;ve purchased of this and I absolutely love it. The most refershing face clean I&#x27;ve ever had!! Love it!! Your face feels clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks. I am age 54 and have combination skin(oily and dry) I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Have used this quite a bit and though I&#x27;m not using it at the moment (I&#x27;m trying Avon for a bit) I loved it while I used it and if my current venture in skincare fails to produce results I&#x27;ll go back to Oil of Olay for sure and would always recommend this as a reasonable priced skincare product though buying it at Amazon is way cheaper than my B&amp;M Walgreens prices!!</li>
            <li> sooooo I am in the crazy teenage stage where acne appears and is dreaded the most..i had tried everything from Neutrogena to clearasil, to l&#x27;oreal products, to biore, to ponds cream. You can IMAGINE the frustration I had with all of these products, because my forehead did not respond well to salicylic acid at allll!..infact, it aggravated my acne, causing an even greater break out! so i had given up for a while, washing my face with water, until i came across olay definitely illuminating cream cleanser. the funny thing is that my mother lovedd beauty products, and so she had everything in our bathroom cabinet ranging from aveeno products, to dove, and mary kay, as well as olay products. I never thought once to just try the cream cleanser and when I did, i said thank you lorrrddd!!!!!!!!! this not only does a great job of concealing blemishes but it makes ur skin brighter!!! u will shine like the true beauty u are!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who also prefers the Olay Definity foaming cleanser. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling fresh and clean like the foaming cleanser does. Perhaps on someone with drier skin, though, it may be more effective. My skin is just rather average, not particularly oily or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the thing I disliked most is the way the cleanser is dispensed. You twist the cap then you squeeze out a bit and rotate the cap closed again. The concave cap means that the cleanser is up against the outside of the cap rather than transferring easily from inside the bottle to your fingertips. I guess since the bottle rests on its cap (as in the photo) this makes sense. It looks good, but from a practical day-to-day perspective, it&#x27;s annoying at best. Certainly not enough to keep from buying the product if I liked it enough, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It makes my skin so soft that the only problem is I want to touch it too much.  The smell is wonderful.  I like the price I get by using the subscribe and save feature and now that I&#x27;ve figured out how long it takes me to use 2 tubes I never run out and don&#x27;t have to go to the store to shop for it.  The exfoliating is very gentle and not the harsh large gritty stuff that many exfoliating cleansers use.  It comes in a tube but not your normal squeeze tube.  There is a hole in the center of the silver metallic top.  You turn the top to open it but the top does not come off.  Once opened you squeeze the tube and the product come out through the small hole in the top.  To close the product turn the top the other direction and tighten.  A small amount of product does come out when you close the product but in my case I&#x27;ve gotten used to that and just squeeze out a little less to start with. One nice thing is you never loose/drop the top in the shower or elsewhere since the top stays on the tube.  I really can&#x27;t think of anything that I don&#x27;t like about this product.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with acne all my life, even when I grew up. This product really helps remove all the dirt and makes me feel clean and clear. I have so much more confidence being around other people now. This is a GREAT! cleanser for all ages! A must buy.</li>
            <li> got the whole regiment for my skin type..worked great</li>
