            <li>Will purchase again when I run out:-)</li>
            <li>I am definitely in love with this scent..</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume</li>
            <li>The person who received the order went out of her/his way to make sure I received this by Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>It smells okay, but it&#x27;s not the Nautica I know and love.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love perfume.  </li>
            <li>I had this many years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it at the store...</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive and decent perfume that will help keep your wife happy.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the original Nautica for women.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean, fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>I purchase this whenever I see it available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and airy.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty strong scent, but I loove it!</li>
            <li>If you like a strong but sensual scent, I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>When I found this product, I was excited and ordered a bottle as soon as I could, thinking that it was the same fragrance that I had once loved.</li>
            <li>In public people who pass by me will stop and say I smell good...</li>
            <li>They tend to complain about wanting more money and all that-- get to be a real pain.  </li>
            <li>I requested a full refund and Amazon quickly granted my request.</li>
            <li>It was a very sexy fragrance, appropriate for the young and young at heart.</li>
            <li>It had a fresh, aquatic smell, with a splash of florals intermixed.</li>
            <li>The guys notice right away.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for special events</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not.</li>
            <li>recieved exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>cause I love it so much I want it to last.</li>
            <li>A few years later I finally remembered it and am able to purchase it online, and have been so entirely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a light, clean smell that is unlike any other.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for offering another venue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I really regret buying this.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nautica</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by the low cost, but I love the quality.</li>
            <li>Something&#x27;s not quite right - it&#x27;s&#x27; almost as if it were a knock-off or old as another reviewer observed.  </li>
            <li>sweet and sexy just cant think of how to describe the smell which makes it hard for those who have never smelled it, to debate on purchasing it.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells heavily of powder and some florals, but the powder smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Apparently some customers lucked up and got fresh bottles.  </li>
            <li>There are no aquatic notes as there were with the original, and the resulting fragrance is really not something I would expect a younger person to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to be purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s hard to find where i live.</li>

            <li> and I bought it from here because it was less expensive than most stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nautica on Thursday and expected to receive it AFTER Christmas.</li>
            <li> then I expected and I recieved it in no time!</li>
            <li> $112 is a lot of money for me to spend on anything, much less an old-smelling fragrance.  </li>

            <li> I used to get at least five compliments everyday about the Nautica by Nautica perfume I was wearing.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t ever seem to find it!</li>
            <li> The bottles I purchased smell horrible and one of my employees said it smelled like cleaning solution.</li>

            <li> I used to love the original Nautica for women. It had a fresh, aquatic smell, with a splash of florals intermixed. It was a very sexy fragrance, appropriate for the young and young at heart. Then, unfortunately, they quit making the fragrance for sale in stores.     When I found this product, I was excited and ordered a bottle as soon as I could, thinking that it was the same fragrance that I had once loved. Unfortunately, it is not. This is a knock-off on the real fragrance, plain and simple. This perfume smells heavily of powder and some florals, but the powder smell is very strong. There are no aquatic notes as there were with the original, and the resulting fragrance is really not something I would expect a younger person to enjoy. I am returning my bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described. This is my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s hard to find where i live. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was buying my husband some Nautica and figured I would try some out for myself.  It has a nice clean, fresh scent to it. Awesome.</li>
            <li> A cousin of mine had bought me some of this for my birthday when I was in my younger teens. I adored the smell of it and always complimented by it. A few years later I finally remembered it and am able to purchase it online, and have been so entirely happy with my purchase. It still smells amazing and my boyfriend just adores it when I put it on. I use it mainly for special events cause I love it so much I want it to last. Looking to purchase a bunch more. Ive been told it smells sweet and sexy just cant think of how to describe the smell which makes it hard for those who have never smelled it, to debate on purchasing it. I personally would say purchasing it wouldnt hurt any and with the compliments I get when I wear it I doubt you would have anything to complain about when so many ask you what it is your wearing. :)</li>
            <li> Purchase arrived way ahead of predicted date.  Perfume was fresh and also offered at a great price.  Thank You.  Would highly recommend this product to be purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal! Can&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere anymore. It&#x27;s my fav! Was a good price, cheaper then I expected and I recieved it in no time! Will purchase again when I run out:-)</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 10 years and learned it has been discontinued and I wanted to stock up. The bottles I purchased smell horrible and one of my employees said it smelled like cleaning solution. Amazon says it cannot return the item because it is hazardous. I requested a full refund and Amazon quickly granted my request. Although I did not have a good experience with this product, Amazon responded with great customer service. Hopefully Amazon will pull this from its shelves- it is just awful.</li>
            <li> I am definitely in love with this scent.. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t ever seem to find it! It is a pretty strong scent, but I loove it! I always get compliments.  The seller was prompt! If you like a strong but sensual scent, I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and I bought it from here because it was less expensive than most stores. good buy  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I ordered Nautica on Thursday and expected to receive it AFTER Christmas. Instead, it arrived on Saturday -- Christmas Eve -- just two days after I placed the order. Unbelievable. The person who received the order went out of her/his way to make sure I received this by Christmas. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  When I found that the Nautica stores no longer carried this perfume, I was thrilled to find it through Amazon.  I purchase this whenever I see it available.  It is a light, clean smell that is unlike any other.  I wear it to work and have never had a complaint of it being overpowering.  Thank you so much for offering another venue to purchase it.  [[ASIN:B000C1W0E6 Nautica By Nautica For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> was on time and what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance for day, night, or anytime. My jusband is crazy about it and always comments when I wear it. In public people who pass by me will stop and say I smell good...men and women both like it. Great fragrance and arrived very fast. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nautica.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite perfume.  I can&#x27;t believe that Nautica replaced this perfume.  I used to get at least five compliments everyday about the Nautica by Nautica perfume I was wearing.  I wish Nautica would bring this perfume back.  It is superior to any line of fragrance that they carried.</li>
            <li> recieved exactly as stated.  Awesome parfum, would highly recommend.  if you are looking for a nice gift this would be it.  kn</li>
            <li> It smells okay, but it&#x27;s not the Nautica I know and love.  Something&#x27;s not quite right - it&#x27;s&#x27; almost as if it were a knock-off or old as another reviewer observed.  $112 is a lot of money for me to spend on anything, much less an old-smelling fragrance.  Apparently some customers lucked up and got fresh bottles.  I&#x27;ll use it to freshen the sofa, carpets, closets, laundry hampers, etc., but I won&#x27;t wear it - that&#x27;s for sure.  I really regret buying this.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive and decent perfume that will help keep your wife happy.  Of course, there is nothing worse than a wife who bothers you all the time.  They tend to complain about wanting more money and all that-- get to be a real pain.  Buy yourself less annoyance.</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on this perfume. It&#x27;s light and airy. The guys notice right away. I&#x27;m surprised by the low cost, but I love the quality. Thanks Nautica</li>
            <li> Was spoiled upon arrival</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents, glad to find it at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I love perfume.  I had this many years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it at the store...I found it here and am very happy with it...it&#x27;s almost time to order more!</li>
