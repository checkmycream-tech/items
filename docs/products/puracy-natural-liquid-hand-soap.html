            <li>Hope this is helpful :-)</li>
            <li>I searched for a better, safer product and found the Puracy hand soap.  </li>
            <li>This hand soap is effective and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We bring so many toxic chemicals into our homes disguised as cleaning products, and then we pump them out into our ground water or off to our water treatment plants.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and great luck making soap.</li>
            <li>, even the best hand soap can’t do its job without proper handwashing technique:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this soap, because I know that my family &amp; I are using a product that is non-toxic with no hormone disruptors &amp; chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a liquid hand soaps, but most of them are the type I pick up in the store.  </li>
            <li>If you don’t agree with that, I’m sure you’ll agree that lavender is a soothing</li>
            <li>Safe for greywater and septic systems</li>
            <li>I love lavender</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>The’ scent is amazing: very fresh, and garden like, and I would love to purchase the product again.</li>
            <li>Not that I ever smell my antibacterial one, but even that mild scent was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is great considering it is all natural and comes in an easy to use pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention its easy to use and doesn&#x27;t create a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better than the Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, which I&#x27;d been using (in rosemary scent).</li>
            <li>The lavender fragrance is strong while washing your hands, but it washes off during the rinse.  </li>
            <li>But it is more than gentle, it really does a great job of cleaning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and a mild hand soap.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself is nice, soft, non-drying to the skin and with a very light smell of lavender and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll begin by saying that this hand soap has the genuine fragrance of lavender.  </li>
            <li>It generates light lather and works well cleaning my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very cost effective for the amount of soap you get.  </li>
            <li>This is a lightly scented liquid soap.</li>
            <li>I love that this soap is not only natural, but it smells great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of lavender is not overpowering, which is good, because I am highly sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked how cleanly this washed off my hands and realized that using a natural, plant based soap was probably better put to use in the kitchen where I&#x27;m handling</li>
            <li>The ingredients are eco friendly.</li>
            <li>I love supporting businesses in this country.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different natural hand soaps, and this one I like the best.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hand soap in my quest for a gentler way to clean my hands.  </li>
            <li>It cleans effectively and thoroughly and leaves my hands feeling clean yet soft.  </li>
            <li>It not only does the job, but it is good for the environment around us and our pets.</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredients are fantastic since I know it is safe for me and my kids.</li>
            <li>I rarely  purchase Eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones, but decided to try the soap, and was extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Safely and effectively clean your hands with the power of plants and natural minerals</li>
            <li>Would have liked to have had a ‘louder’ scent, but still very much like the Puracy Natural Hand Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great without being overpowering and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light lavender smell and leaves my hands very clean feeling, but not dry.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients that are specifically chosen for their earth-friendly qualities.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the soap has a natural smell without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it is definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, THOUGH, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT&#x27;S WHY IT COSTS MORE.</li>
            <li>have been using this for over a week without any reactions at all, and give this a full approval - that I am willing to recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a strong scent from the Puracy Natural Hand Soap, but found a rather mild one instead.  </li>
            <li>We hit the jackpot in finding the right product for us in this crowded marketplace.</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I went to a lavender festival out west and purchased products that were made right there on the lavender farms.  </li>
            <li>pump dispenses just the right amount and doesn’t drip and make a</li>
            <li>The pump outputs the right amount for washing hands on one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love the natural smell first of all.</li>
            <li>I love the gentleness of this, especially since I am sensitive to many chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has a very light and fresh fragrance and the product also feels light on the skin and washes off easily and has not dried out my hands like some harsh soaps.</li>
            <li>bottle holds a full 12 oz., which is a good amount, especially compared to other brands in bottles that don’t even hold a full 8 oz.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re already almost out of our first order and look forward to now ordering one of their reduced priced</li>
            <li>When I first got this soap I set it in the family bathroom for everyone to use.</li>
            <li>This soap smells exactly like them.  </li>
            <li>I’m all for eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones.  </li>
            <li>B00HAPI0L4 Puracy 4X Natural Liquid Laundry Detergent, Free and Clear]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>B00HAPI0L4 Puracy 4X Natural Liquid Laundry Detergent, Free and Clear]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t let the lavender scent throw you - it&#x27;s really pungent during the actual wash but sits very lightly on the skin after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It cleans grease and grime off and is gentle enough to keep by my kitchen sink where I wash my hands the most.</li>
            <li>It leaves you with that extra clean feeling!</li>
            <li>this is not a natural and safe product.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle cleaner that leaves my hands clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product because my hands don&#x27;t feel parched and dry after washing them.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I try a lot of different hand soaps.. and if you are looking for a liquid hand soap this one is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Puracy hand soap produces a nice lather and emits a rich natural fragrance, with an immediate flood of sharp pine-like lavender followed by a sweet vanilla, very complex and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I really like Puracy&#x27;s hand soaps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is gentle on your hands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want to use a quality, safer product!</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this soap!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks using this hand soap, my family and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It is much improved.  </li>
            <li>Recently, my girlfriend and I made a decision that we wanted to phase out the more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; lines of cleaning products in our household and move to all natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands with this soap the nice scent lingers on my hands a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Not runny, not too thick, good consistency for liquid soap now.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my hands well, leaves them smelling nice and does not strip my hands of natural oil as other soaps and detergents do.  </li>
            <li>I can use this soap to wash greasy foods like butter or cooking oil off my hands, and it leaves them clean and without an signs of left over residue.</li>
            <li>Yet, there is enough lather to make my hands feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Beyond the company&#x27;s website being very clean, it is extremely informative.</li>
            <li>It is not as &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; as other brands of liquid soap because of its more natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I prefer soap to have a little more soap like consistency.</li>
            <li>My hands feel clean but soft even after multiple washes.</li>
            <li>Dry hands with a clean or disposable towel or air</li>
            <li>Also contains aloe vera which we regularly buy fresh from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several interesting things about the Puracy Natural Hand Soap and that’s the claim that the “lavender essential oil provides a naturally antiseptic quality.”  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading my review, the vendor contacted me to let me know they had updated the formula and offered to send me a new one to try out.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and is subtle rather than over-bearing.  </li>
            <li>Our proprietary blend of natural cleansers, including Aloe Vera and Vegetable Glycerin, gently remove soil and naturally moisturize your skin</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t dry out/ruin my skin the way other harsh chemicals have, and is safe for use around my animals.</li>
            <li>no harsh chemicals, no petroleum products and no animal by-products.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 5 bottles and they arrived fast, individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>And being plant based, I really like the idea of using this as a kitchen hand soap, when you&#x27;re going to be handling people&#x27;s food and constantly washing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>/&gt;Puracy is an all natural soap.</li>
            <li>Lauryl Ether Sulphate (natural cleaner)&lt;br /&gt;Aloe-vera-based Surfactant (proprietary plant-based cleanser)&lt;br /&gt;Glycerine (natural skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All natural, hypoallergenic, non-toxic, and biodegradable</li>

            <li>B00GDLML02 Puracy Natural Hand Soap, Lavendar and Vanilla]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Then after using it a few times, I realized how much I enjoyed how it left my hands feeling after washing them.</li>
            <li>It is quickly replacing every other hand soap in my home!</li>
            <li>This liquid soap does the exact opposite by almost acting as a lotion/soap combination to my hands.  </li>
            <li>We love each product and have literally not a single complaint around efficacy, packaging, fragrance, ANYTHING!</li>
            <li>Such a soft and calming fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>☼  Lavender essential oil provides a naturally antiseptic quality&lt;br /</li>
            <li>We had concerns regarding efficacy, scents, price, but decided it was important enough for us to at least look into it what options were out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purified Water, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (Natural Cleanser), Aloe Vera-Based Surfactant (Proprietary Plant-Based Cleanser), Vegetable Glycerin (Plant-Based Hand Softener), Citric Acid (Plant-Based pH Adjuster), Lavender Essential Oil, Vanilla Essential Oil, Methylisothiazolinone (Preservative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Just a little tiny pearly ball produce so much suds is quite</li>
            <li>It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much as the other soap I was using.  </li>
            <li>The soap is very soft on the hands and has not caused any discomfort like other</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I liked how cleanly this washed off my hands and realized that using a natural, plant based soap was probably better put to use in the kitchen where I&#x27;m handling</li>
            <li> The ingredients are eco friendly.</li>
            <li> I love supporting businesses in this country.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different natural hand soaps, and this one I like the best.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hand soap in my quest for a gentler way to clean my hands.  </li>
            <li> It cleans effectively and thoroughly and leaves my hands feeling clean yet soft.  </li>
            <li> It not only does the job, but it is good for the environment around us and our pets.</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredients are fantastic since I know it is safe for me and my kids.</li>
            <li> I rarely  purchase Eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones, but decided to try the soap, and was extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Safely and effectively clean your hands with the power of plants and natural minerals</li>
            <li> Would have liked to have had a ‘louder’ scent, but still very much like the Puracy Natural Hand Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great without being overpowering and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a light lavender smell and leaves my hands very clean feeling, but not dry.</li>
            <li> love the fact that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients that are specifically chosen for their earth-friendly qualities.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the soap has a natural smell without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it is definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, THOUGH, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT&#x27;S WHY IT COSTS MORE.</li>
            <li> have been using this for over a week without any reactions at all, and give this a full approval - that I am willing to recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting a strong scent from the Puracy Natural Hand Soap, but found a rather mild one instead.  </li>
            <li> We hit the jackpot in finding the right product for us in this crowded marketplace.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I went to a lavender festival out west and purchased products that were made right there on the lavender farms.  </li>
            <li> pump dispenses just the right amount and doesn’t drip and make a</li>
            <li> The pump outputs the right amount for washing hands on one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love the natural smell first of all.</li>
            <li> I love the gentleness of this, especially since I am sensitive to many chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has a very light and fresh fragrance and the product also feels light on the skin and washes off easily and has not dried out my hands like some harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> bottle holds a full 12 oz., which is a good amount, especially compared to other brands in bottles that don’t even hold a full 8 oz.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re already almost out of our first order and look forward to now ordering one of their reduced priced</li>
            <li> When I first got this soap I set it in the family bathroom for everyone to use.</li>
            <li> This soap smells exactly like them.  </li>
            <li> I’m all for eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones.  </li>

            <li> And don&#x27;t let the lavender scent throw you - it&#x27;s really pungent during the actual wash but sits very lightly on the skin after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It cleans grease and grime off and is gentle enough to keep by my kitchen sink where I wash my hands the most.</li>
            <li> It leaves you with that extra clean feeling!</li>
            <li> this is not a natural and safe product.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle cleaner that leaves my hands clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product because my hands don&#x27;t feel parched and dry after washing them.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different hand soaps.. and if you are looking for a liquid hand soap this one is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Puracy hand soap produces a nice lather and emits a rich natural fragrance, with an immediate flood of sharp pine-like lavender followed by a sweet vanilla, very complex and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I really like Puracy&#x27;s hand soaps.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is gentle on your hands.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to use a quality, safer product!</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this soap!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks using this hand soap, my family and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It is much improved.  </li>
            <li> Recently, my girlfriend and I made a decision that we wanted to phase out the more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; lines of cleaning products in our household and move to all natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands with this soap the nice scent lingers on my hands a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not runny, not too thick, good consistency for liquid soap now.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my hands well, leaves them smelling nice and does not strip my hands of natural oil as other soaps and detergents do.  </li>
            <li> I can use this soap to wash greasy foods like butter or cooking oil off my hands, and it leaves them clean and without an signs of left over residue.</li>
            <li> Yet, there is enough lather to make my hands feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Beyond the company&#x27;s website being very clean, it is extremely informative.</li>
            <li> It is not as &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; as other brands of liquid soap because of its more natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I prefer soap to have a little more soap like consistency.</li>
            <li> My hands feel clean but soft even after multiple washes.</li>
            <li> Dry hands with a clean or disposable towel or air</li>
            <li> Also contains aloe vera which we regularly buy fresh from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several interesting things about the Puracy Natural Hand Soap and that’s the claim that the “lavender essential oil provides a naturally antiseptic quality.”  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading my review, the vendor contacted me to let me know they had updated the formula and offered to send me a new one to try out.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and is subtle rather than over-bearing.  </li>
            <li> Our proprietary blend of natural cleansers, including Aloe Vera and Vegetable Glycerin, gently remove soil and naturally moisturize your skin</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t dry out/ruin my skin the way other harsh chemicals have, and is safe for use around my animals.</li>
            <li> no harsh chemicals, no petroleum products and no animal by-products.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 5 bottles and they arrived fast, individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> And being plant based, I really like the idea of using this as a kitchen hand soap, when you&#x27;re going to be handling people&#x27;s food and constantly washing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>

            <li> Not natural as described.</li>
            <li> where have you been all my life.</li>
            <li> It smells good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  My family of 5 is very happy with this soap.  5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I really like Puracy&#x27;s hand soaps. My hands feel clean but soft even after multiple washes. And don&#x27;t let the lavender scent throw you - it&#x27;s really pungent during the actual wash but sits very lightly on the skin after rinsing.</li>
            <li> This hand soap is pushing all the others hand soaps aside in my bathroom in kitchen.  Puracy has created a product that smells great and really cleans my hands well.  I leave the room knowing I&#x27;ve just made my hands cleaner than they were before I walked in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it&#x27;s all natural and its in liquid form is the best of both worlds!  The usual all-natural hand soaps come in bars and leave my hands dry and irritable.  This liquid soap does the exact opposite by almost acting as a lotion/soap combination to my hands.  Not to mention its easy to use and doesn&#x27;t create a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it smells amazing?!  I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> Recently, my girlfriend and I made a decision that we wanted to phase out the more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; lines of cleaning products in our household and move to all natural alternatives. We had concerns regarding efficacy, scents, price, but decided it was important enough for us to at least look into it what options were out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During our research, we found the Puracy line of products. Beyond the company&#x27;s website being very clean, it is extremely informative. We were instantly attracted to the scents of products (Lavender &amp; Vanilla, Green Tea &amp; Lime, etc.), along with the price points and the fact that each product is made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We placed an initial order to test out each product. Needless to say, we couldn&#x27;t be happier with our choice. We love each product and have literally not a single complaint around efficacy, packaging, fragrance, ANYTHING! We hit the jackpot in finding the right product for us in this crowded marketplace. We&#x27;re already almost out of our first order and look forward to now ordering one of their reduced priced bundles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific to this hand soap - The lavender and vanilla scent is INCREDIBLE. We seriously love it. The soap is very soft on the hands and has not caused any discomfort like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would highly recommend! Hope this is helpful :-)</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, my wife and I agreed on this one. We love the natural smell first of all. I didn&#x27;t know that the combination of vanilla and lavender produces a very pleasant aroma.  I press it very lightly, as a mere glob is enough to wash my hands.  Just a little tiny pearly ball produce so much suds is quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle on your hands.  You won&#x27;t feel dry, no harsh chemicals, no petroleum products and no animal by-products.  Also contains aloe vera which we regularly buy fresh from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I was using an anti-bacterial soap until I heard about the dangerous ingredient in it.  I searched for a better, safer product and found the Puracy hand soap.  It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much as the other soap I was using.  The lavender fragrance is strong while washing your hands, but it washes off during the rinse.  I highly recommend this product if you want to use a quality, safer product!</li>
            <li> Erm, no. this is not a natural and safe product. trust americans to give this a 4.7 star 300 + vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always question these companies. And don&#x27;t take their word on the ingredients, one of which :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzisothiazolinone *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a known eye, lung and skin irritant and its a preservative which you don&#x27;t want to be using to wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, your choice people. It&#x27;s not as if what you buy has an impact on what is created for sale..</li>
            <li> After receiving a sample to try out, I found that it had a nice pleasant scent, the lavender and vanilla work well together. It is also a very good hand soap and is very gentle on my hands while getting them clean.</li>
            <li> This hand soap is effective and smells fantastic. It is quickly replacing every other hand soap in my home! The all natural ingredients are fantastic since I know it is safe for me and my kids. I would highly reccomend this soap!</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 bottles and they arrived fast, individually wrapped in plastic. However one of them had leaked a third of the bottle. The soap itself is nice, soft, non-drying to the skin and with a very light smell of lavender and vanilla. Yes i will likely order again.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different hand soaps.. and if you are looking for a liquid hand soap this one is my new favorite. It has a very light and fresh fragrance and the product also feels light on the skin and washes off easily and has not dried out my hands like some harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a divine soap, with a deliciously gorgeous smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand soap I will use on myself. It not only does the job, but it is good for the environment around us and our pets. It leaves you with that extra clean feeling!</li>
            <li> When I first got this soap I set it in the family bathroom for everyone to use. Then after using it a few times, I realized how much I enjoyed how it left my hands feeling after washing them. So I moved the soap to the kitchen, where I have to wash my hands constantly while cooking. When preparing a meal, I frequently need to wash my hands a half dozen times or so, in a very short time, because of handling meats and such. I liked how cleanly this washed off my hands and realized that using a natural, plant based soap was probably better put to use in the kitchen where I&#x27;m handling everyone&#x27;s food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and the bottle pump works well. No leaking of soap out the sides of it. I can use this soap to wash greasy foods like butter or cooking oil off my hands, and it leaves them clean and without an signs of left over residue. And being plant based, I really like the idea of using this as a kitchen hand soap, when you&#x27;re going to be handling people&#x27;s food and constantly washing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin by saying that this hand soap has the genuine fragrance of lavender.  A couple of years ago I went to a lavender festival out west and purchased products that were made right there on the lavender farms.  This soap smells exactly like them.  Such a soft and calming fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients that are specifically chosen for their earth-friendly qualities.  We bring so many toxic chemicals into our homes disguised as cleaning products, and then we pump them out into our ground water or off to our water treatment plants.  These chemicals never really go away.  They just end up back in our lives in some other form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about our overuse of antibacterial agents in our soaps and the effect they are having on antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  This is simply soap.  It cleans effectively and thoroughly and leaves my hands feeling clean yet soft.  That&#x27;s all I need or want in my hand soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap! I feel like the soap has a natural smell without being overwhelming. Yet, there is enough lather to make my hands feel really clean. Thanks and great luck making soap.</li>
            <li> Cleans well without chemicals, and the lavender scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li> It is not as &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; as other brands of liquid soap because of its more natural ingredients.  It cleans my hands well, leaves them smelling nice and does not strip my hands of natural oil as other soaps and detergents do.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it and can honestly give it five stars.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14QBVCSHPY5TF]]Puracy hand soap smells terrific. Lavender is the strongest component of the scent but vanilla adds a very nice tone and makes its scent rather unique. I love good smelling hand soaps and I Lavender Vanilla is a really nice one. It generates light lather and works well cleaning my hands. I washed my hands after spreading Jojoba Oil with my hands and after applying make-up foundation with my fingertips. The soap handle both quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my hands with this soap the nice scent lingers on my hands a few minutes. The scent is very light I can smell it only if I bring my hands close to my nose. The bathroom where I wash my hands with this soap also has just a bit of lavender scent for a few minutes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy is an all natural soap. Below is the list of ingredients. I received a sample for review purposes and I really like it. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified water&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate (natural cleaner)&lt;br /&gt;Aloe-vera-based Surfactant (proprietary plant-based cleanser)&lt;br /&gt;Glycerine (natural skin softener)&lt;br /&gt;Citric Acid (plant based pH adjuster)&lt;br /&gt;Lavender essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone (preservative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Puracy hand soap produces a nice lather and emits a rich natural fragrance, with an immediate flood of sharp pine-like lavender followed by a sweet vanilla, very complex and enjoyable. It does a great job cleaning, rinses well, and leaves the skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle holds a full 12 oz., which is a good amount, especially compared to other brands in bottles that don’t even hold a full 8 oz. but which have shrunk to 7.5 oz. It has a paper label that can be removed by wiping it with olive oil and leaving it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenses just the right amount and doesn’t drip and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients, as listed on the bottle that I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified water, sodium lauryl ether sulfate, aloe vera-based surfactant, glycerin, citric acid, lavender essential oil, vanilla essential oil, methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, even the best hand soap can’t do its job without proper handwashing technique:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wet hands with running water.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply soap and lather well.&lt;br /&gt;* Rub hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* Scrub all surfaces, including the backs of hands, wrists, between fingers, and under fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;* Rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;* Dry hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer.&lt;br /&gt;* If possible, use a towel to turn off the faucet and open the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy provided a sample for testing and impartial review. This is a good quality liquid soap with a delightful fragrance, so I can confidently recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, because I know that my family &amp; I are using a product that is non-toxic with no hormone disruptors &amp; chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very cost effective for the amount of soap you get.  It costs less than what some people pay for two Dial soap foaming pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of lavender is not overpowering, which is good, because I am highly sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope other scents are added to the line in the future!  Any kind of fruit, including grapefruit, would be wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it is definitely worth a try.  You have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL soap. Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t dry out/ruin my skin the way other harsh chemicals have, and is safe for use around my animals.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with all of the store brands so I decided to try something new. After a couple of weeks using this hand soap, my family and I really like it.  It is tough enough to clean, yet doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  The scent is very nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different natural hand soaps, and this one I like the best. It smells great without being overpowering and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but leaves it soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After reading my review, the vendor contacted me to let me know they had updated the formula and offered to send me a new one to try out.  It is much improved.  Not runny, not too thick, good consistency for liquid soap now.  Smells nice and is subtle rather than over-bearing.  The pump outputs the right amount for washing hands on one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased March 2015: Too runny for my preference.  I prefer soap to have a little more soap like consistency.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL AND FEEL, BUT A BIT PRICEY!  I LIKE THAT IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, THOUGH, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT&#x27;S WHY IT COSTS MORE.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product. The scent is very nice and not too strong. The ingredients are eco friendly.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and a mild hand soap.  I have sensitive skin and I have no reaction to this hand soap.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love the gentleness of this, especially since I am sensitive to many chemicals. But it is more than gentle, it really does a great job of cleaning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a week without any reactions at all, and give this a full approval - that I am willing to recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to have been given a sample that I could use to test it out.</li>
            <li> This is a lightly scented liquid soap. It lathers nicely, and rinses off easily. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This soap works really great. It has a light lavender smell and leaves my hands very clean feeling, but not dry. I can&#x27;t smell the vanilla at all. It works better than the Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, which I&#x27;d been using (in rosemary scent). For example, I was gardening recently and grabbed a slug by mistake and my hand got all slimy. I ran inside to the kitchen and washed my hands with the Meyer&#x27;s, but my hand still felt slimy. So I ran to my bathroom (where I keep the Puracy) and washed my hands with the Puracy and the slimy stuff on my hands instantly went away. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered Puracy, and I&#x27;m going to order more!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hand soap in my quest for a gentler way to clean my hands.  I am pleased with this product because my hands don&#x27;t feel parched and dry after washing them.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle cleaner that leaves my hands clean and soft.  The odor is not over powering. My only wish is that it came out of the bottle slower.</li>
            <li> I use a liquid hand soaps, but most of them are the type I pick up in the store.  As a rule, they are antibacterial.  There’s been a slight movement away from them now and having an eco-friendly, hypoallergenic one appealed to me.  I was expecting a strong scent from the Puracy Natural Hand Soap, but found a rather mild one instead.  Not that I ever smell my antibacterial one, but even that mild scent was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several interesting things about the Puracy Natural Hand Soap and that’s the claim that the “lavender essential oil provides a naturally antiseptic quality.”  It is an accepted fact in the alternative medicine community.  If you don’t agree with that, I’m sure you’ll agree that lavender is a soothing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve only tried one other Puracy product and already know I’ll like the entire line.  I’m all for eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones.  This hand soap doesn’t dry out my hands, but rather has a tendency to moisturize them.  I’m had my hands in and out of water all day and haven’t had to use a hand lotion.  Would have liked to have had a ‘louder’ scent, but still very much like the Puracy Natural Hand Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;☼  Safely and effectively clean your hands with the power of plants and natural minerals&lt;br /&gt;☼  NO SLS, triclosan, parabens, phosphates, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, chlorine, petrochemicals, dyes, or caustics&lt;br /&gt;☼  All natural, hypoallergenic, non-toxic, and biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;☼  Our proprietary blend of natural cleansers, including Aloe Vera and Vegetable Glycerin, gently remove soil and naturally moisturize your skin&lt;br /&gt;☼  Lavender essential oil provides a naturally antiseptic quality&lt;br /&gt;☼  Never tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;☼  Safe for greywater and septic systems&lt;br /&gt;☼  Lavender &amp; Vanilla&lt;br /&gt;☼  12 fl. oz.

            <li> I love lavender but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of vanilla. However, the scent of this soap is the perfect blend. Not overpowering and subtle enough to put a smile on my face. It cleans grease and grime off and is gentle enough to keep by my kitchen sink where I wash my hands the most. No issues with drying or cracking either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great considering it is all natural and comes in an easy to use pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I rarely  purchase Eco-friendly household products, especially septic safe ones, but decided to try the soap, and was extremely pleased with it. This hand soap doesn’t dry out my hands, and even moisturize them. I’m had my hands in and out of water all day and didn&#x27;t experience any &amp;#34;dry effects&amp;#34; . The’ scent is amazing: very fresh, and garden like, and I would love to purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> I love that this soap is not only natural, but it smells great!  I didn&#x27;t want antibacterial soaps in my household and this was the perfect solution.  Not only that, it&#x27;s made in the USA!  I love supporting businesses in this country.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap.  The balance of vanilla to lavendar is just as it should be and the soap is very kind to my hands.  I would certainly buy it again.</li>
