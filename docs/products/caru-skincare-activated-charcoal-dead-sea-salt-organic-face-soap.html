            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it to bring on vacation and that was an extremely good decision on my part.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since using it.</li>
            <li>Best facial soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Caru Skincare charcoal soap represents a balance between healthy skincare and environmental friendliness.  </li>
            <li>I love the versatility of this soap.</li>
            <li>I do love the feel of the soap and use it with the Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this charcoal soap as opposed to so many others on the market.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the sent and how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are so clean and pure, nothing fancy in here but what is needed :) Won&#x27;t irritate the skin and smells very, very good, not chemical like the others.  </li>
            <li>It truly makes my face feel clean, refreshed and amazing.</li>
            <li>Even my acne is becoming manageable, plus I love the sea salt smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lather, doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that odour, but clean is okay</li>
            <li>The odor was so strong it made me gag</li>
            <li>It has a decently strong smell, but is not undesirable(to me) and does not linger on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; but that wasn&#x27;t true for me, Neutrogena products do a better job</li>
            <li>price is a primary factor.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and everyone was intrigued by the smell they said it had a slight lemon fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Love the soft feel it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it lasted for me to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, especially for the summertime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>Been using for 3 weeks, and my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will comment that washing with this soap in a hot shower and using Biore Pore Strips afterwards resulted in the removal of a lot of blackheads.  </li>
            <li>My finances are, unfortunately, not infinite and there is a lot of competition in the skincare field.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove make up, so if you&#x27;re interested in adding another step to your beauty regime then give it a shot...</li>
            <li>Absolutely phenomenal facial soap.  </li>
            <li>, I love this stuff, paired with the jojoba oil from the same skin care line, it works marvels for the skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap does exactly what a soap should do - cleans well</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on skin, and it foams!</li>
            <li>Pricey, but exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I just use it on my body and the salt does a great job exfoliating while the charcoal sucks up any impurities in the skin.</li>
            <li>This was a great product, but it really didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>Typically, I use this product to cleanse my face twice a day and under my arms if it has been an excessively warm or stressful day.  </li>
            <li>I really like this charcoal and sea salt soap.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for use at hone or anywhere else!  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a facial soap and my skin feels clean, clarified, and moisturized after use.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the acne marks that were once very difficult to fade on my cheeks are now disappearing each time I wash with this magnificent soap and my acne is healing as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just different.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;yes.\\&quot;  I will, typically, pay [considerably] more for a well-made durable product (I think in terms of decades when I reference the word \\&quot;durable\\&quot;),</li>
            <li>This soap is foaming, and gentle, and leaves the skin clean, yet not stripped dry.</li>
            <li>If using it on your face for the first time, test a small spot to make sure your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Charcoal is not excessively expensive(you can make it if so inclined!)</li>
            <li>Really cleanses and removes makeup well and leaves skin so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this a few days ago, but I&#x27;ve already seen the texture of my skin change for the better.</li>
            <li>He has not had much luck with ordinary body washes or specialty preparations but after a few days of using the Caru soaps he says his skin is better exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Some users have mentioned the smell, but this is not my first soap made with essential oils (it is my first with charcoal), and I find a lot of the smell comes from these essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff works!</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times and my face feels so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it because bar soap has always been too drying for my sensitive skin, but I had no problem with this soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it also breaks out once in a while.</li>
            <li>Only been using for a week, so to soon for any real results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking so healthy lately, kudos</li>
            <li>I only use it a few times a week but may do so more now that the smell has dissipated.  </li>
            <li>The 3 stars is entirely due to the stink; no matter how good it might be, I will never get past that initial revolting smell.</li>
            <li>It builds a nice lather which is hard to find in other skin care products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so smooth, and it&#x27;s delicate.</li>
            <li>Soap doesn&#x27;t last long and got very mushy.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, Caru Skincare&#x27;s soap will be relegated to \\&quot;facial cleansing only\\&quot; due to its high cost.</li>

            <li> Foams up and really cleanses...however, just a little drying and smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> (I would still recommend a daily moisturizer in dry climates).  </li>
            <li> Smells awful but seems to clean OK.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am still uncertain that this soap is also keeping my pores and complexion any cleaner than my previous facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I would break out after the daily use of sunscreen, but never with this product.  </li>
            <li> I did breakout in one spot, but I expect that from starting to use a new exfoliating product and haven&#x27;t broken out again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected, but for the price?  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past two weeks with my activated charcoal facial sponge.</li>
            <li> even though it smells a little bad, I love the way it makes my face feel after washing.</li>
            <li> and my other essential and olive oil(these are both typically expensive ingredients) soaps are 50% less expensive for 33% more mass.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy it again as it is surely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> the foulest, vilest, most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and removes odors and excessive surface skin oils well without drying out the skin</li>
            <li> I cut it up in small pieces and use a piece at a time</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s only vaguely unpleasant if I bring the bar up to my face.  </li>
            <li> Weird smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not awesome.  </li>
            <li> I hate cleansers that don’t foam-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that odour, but clean is okay</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I have been using this for the past two weeks with my activated charcoal facial sponge. I can see such a difference in my skin. Everyone is complimenting me on how good my skin looks. The soap smells kind of weird but only slightly. Love this soap--- buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> I really like this charcoal and sea salt soap. I was hesitant to buy it because bar soap has always been too drying for my sensitive skin, but I had no problem with this soap. I use it primarily as a facial soap and my skin feels clean, clarified, and moisturized after use. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I have only used it a couple of times and my face feels so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> The soap cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling over-dried.  However, initially the odor was repulsive - the foulest, vilest, most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  I can&#x27;t believe only two others mentioned the smell.  I&#x27;ve used sea salt soaps before without problems so it&#x27;s obviously the activated charcoal.  The odor was so strong it made me gag so I put it in the shower to air out, which took about a month - now it&#x27;s only vaguely unpleasant if I bring the bar up to my face.  I only use it a few times a week but may do so more now that the smell has dissipated.  The 3 stars is entirely due to the stink; no matter how good it might be, I will never get past that initial revolting smell.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this soap! I tried others that has similar ingredients but had to reorder this one. I have sensitive skin, but it also breaks out once in a while. I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since using it. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> even though it smells a little bad, I love the way it makes my face feel after washing.</li>
            <li> Best facial soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Been using for 3 weeks, and my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Weird smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the tea tree oil soaps for my son who has keratosis pilaris. He has not had much luck with ordinary body washes or specialty preparations but after a few days of using the Caru soaps he says his skin is better exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lather, doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything.  Soap doesn&#x27;t last long and got very mushy.</li>
            <li> The Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Caru Skincare charcoal soap represents a balance between healthy skincare and environmental friendliness.  It cleans and removes odors and excessive surface skin oils well without drying out the skin (I would still recommend a daily moisturizer in dry climates).  Typically, I use this product to cleanse my face twice a day and under my arms if it has been an excessively warm or stressful day.  Some users have mentioned the smell, but this is not my first soap made with essential oils (it is my first with charcoal), and I find a lot of the smell comes from these essential oils.  It has a decently strong smell, but is not undesirable(to me) and does not linger on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why not 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a primary factor.  Charcoal is not excessively expensive(you can make it if so inclined!) and my other essential and olive oil(these are both typically expensive ingredients) soaps are 50% less expensive for 33% more mass.  I am still uncertain that this soap is also keeping my pores and complexion any cleaner than my previous facial cleansers.  I will comment that washing with this soap in a hot shower and using Biore Pore Strips afterwards resulted in the removal of a lot of blackheads.  Additional time and usage will resolve the mystery of whether or not Caru reduces future blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I purchase this soap again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, although I would like to claim \\&quot;yes.\\&quot;  I will, typically, pay [considerably] more for a well-made durable product (I think in terms of decades when I reference the word \\&quot;durable\\&quot;), but I think the Caru soap bar needs to adjust its price in the downward direction before I can say \\&quot;yes\\&quot; with conviction.  My finances are, unfortunately, not infinite and there is a lot of competition in the skincare field.  In the meantime, Caru Skincare&#x27;s soap will be relegated to \\&quot;facial cleansing only\\&quot; due to its high cost.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased.  I originally bought it to bring on vacation and that was an extremely good decision on my part.  The soap removes all of the sunscreen from your face and body and my skin looks great!  Typically, I would break out after the daily use of sunscreen, but never with this product.  It is also foamy enough to use to shave your legs without the necessity of another product.  It travels well since it is a bar soap, not liquid, which makes it easier to pack.  I would highly recommend this product for use at hone or anywhere else!  It also lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve had the same bar for 5 weeks and while it is almost gone, I have another waiting for me at home. It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this soap. I hate cleansers that don’t foam- they’re so unsatisfying. This soap is foaming, and gentle, and leaves the skin clean, yet not stripped dry.</li>
            <li> I must admit I haven&#x27;t been as diligent with this as I should but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference with my skin.  The smell of this soap is the only thing I have noticed... it&#x27;s not awesome.  It does not remove make up, so if you&#x27;re interested in adding another step to your beauty regime then give it a shot...otherwise I&#x27;d stick with a one product wonder.</li>
            <li> Smells awful but seems to clean OK.  Nothing special at all. I will not buy it again as it is surely not worth the price. It also doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a week, so to soon for any real results.  I do love the feel of the soap and use it with the Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal facial soap.  Really cleanses and removes makeup well and leaves skin so soft and supple.  I have noticed that the acne marks that were once very difficult to fade on my cheeks are now disappearing each time I wash with this magnificent soap and my acne is healing as well.  My skin is looking so healthy lately, kudos, I love this stuff, paired with the jojoba oil from the same skin care line, it works marvels for the skin.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this charcoal soap as opposed to so many others on the market. The ingredients are so clean and pure, nothing fancy in here but what is needed :) Won&#x27;t irritate the skin and smells very, very good, not chemical like the others.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This soap does exactly what a soap should do - cleans well, it&#x27;s gentle on skin, and it foams!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for my sister and she loves it. The packaging was great and everyone was intrigued by the smell they said it had a slight lemon fresh smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just different.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Foams up and really cleanses...however, just a little drying and smaller than expected. Overall great product, especially for the summertime!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap. After using it I can tell there are no hash chemicals in it. Love the soft feel it gives my skin. I cut it up in small pieces and use a piece at a time so it last longer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love this soap.  Works so well for my skin, wish I&#x27;d had it twenty years ago.  Very very good for my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a try because it&#x27;s organic but personally it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me and I have been using this product for over a month. It claims that the &amp;#34;Activated Charcoal Detoxifies by Helping to Draw Out Impurities From the Skin&amp;#34; but that wasn&#x27;t true for me, Neutrogena products do a better job and I will buy those again.</li>
            <li> Dopest soap ive ever used. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Even my acne is becoming manageable, plus I love the sea salt smell. Def a great way to start the day.</li>
            <li> This was a great product, but it really didn&#x27;t last that long.  That&#x27;s to be expected, but for the price?  I don&#x27;t think it lasted for me to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few days ago, but I&#x27;ve already seen the texture of my skin change for the better. I did breakout in one spot, but I expect that from starting to use a new exfoliating product and haven&#x27;t broken out again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It truly makes my face feel clean, refreshed and amazing. It builds a nice lather which is hard to find in other skin care products.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but exactly what I wanted.  I did find a local soap maker and got it for a lower price.  I use it on my face to draw impurities.  I use with a cosmetic rotating brush for facial cleansing as my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Just repurchased this soap. I love the sent and how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Love this! It leaves my skin so smooth, and it&#x27;s delicate. Definitely will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff works! If using it on your face for the first time, test a small spot to make sure your skin can handle it. I just use it on my body and the salt does a great job exfoliating while the charcoal sucks up any impurities in the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped clear up my skin. I love it!</li>
