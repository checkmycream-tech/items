            <li>Love potion 9!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love what this does to my hair!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Potion9 is a leave in protein treatment I have been using for about 4 months and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing and the frizz is under control.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works amazing whether I want to scrunch my hair or straighten it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since an amazing hair stylist introduced me to it in the 90&#x27;s, and it remains my standby for a conditioning treatment/styling product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus, the price is nice.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product for my hair and works really well as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>that kind of a sacrifice</li>
            <li>Both of these products give my think hair a nice blow out.</li>
            <li>but it helps hold my awesome texture without too much hair expanding.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I don&#x27;t have the greatest hair and it definitely works well for me-</li>
            <li>Excellent products and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Provides a nice level of moisture and controls flyaway strands while reducing the appearance of split ends.</li>
            <li>I do get nice ringlets, but again, they are crunchy.  </li>
            <li>But, that is my own issue, not the product.</li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>I had a very good stylist who first used it on my hair</li>
            <li>Great product and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I have used Potion 9 for over 15 years, and I can honestly say, I am 100% confident I will never replace it for another product.</li>
            <li>By far the best product and price!</li>
            <li>My hair is still as great as when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent, no other words:)  </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I get so many complaints on how healthy and shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li>the product arrived in good conditions and exactly like I wanted to.</li>
            <li>I have used Potion 9 for years and found it to be the greatest product for putting into my curly hair and letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also a hair conditioner / restorer / fixer so easy to use and keeping the hair healthy</li>
            <li>so if you have a beautiful natural curl I highly recommend it-and even if you don&#x27;t, it still does exceptionally well:)</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive Hair this would work great for you.</li>
            <li>Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>After a year and half search for a better hair product, this is the first one that impressed me, so nice.</li>
            <li>For me, it wasn&#x27;t that easy</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and really makes my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a salon size, but with the pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years on my curly and strong hair.</li>
            <li>Will leave your hair feeling and looking amazing consistently</li>
            <li>Very pleased fast response time</li>
            <li>and I believe this product is a big reason my hair has been as to grow and look so beautiful.</li>
            <li>it softens the hair and smells fine.</li>
            <li>Great daily conditioner and styler for fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li>The best product I have ever used for natural wavy soft hair style.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so silky and smooth but never greasy.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny :)</li>
            <li>My hair goes to about the bottom of my shoulder blades, so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product to make it effective.</li>
            <li>After finger combing the product into my hair, I lightly scrunch my hair to help the curls set.</li>
            <li>Just the same great results day after day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I shared a bottle of crappy cheap shampoo during the cruise</li>
            <li>and I shared a bottle of crappy cheap shampoo during the cruise</li>
            <li>It is still great for my very big, frizzy, curly, out of control hair.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product .</li>
            <li>At any price this is a fabulous holding sprays</li>
            <li>I tried it and after only 3 applications in 3 weeks, I can see a great improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>the kind they sell in grocery stores isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product to give you the &amp;#34;wild curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Is a fantastic product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>Rthank you so much ! ! !</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years now and find it to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff - I have used it for years - it makes your hair soft but holds it in place really well</li>
            <li>Smells so clean.</li>
            <li>special note:  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say there is no other hair product that I LOVE as much as Sebastian Potion 9!</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not heavy or lingering.</li>
            <li>My hair has already grown about 2-3 full inches (which it never does).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never found it to be true.  </li>
            <li>I would still wear a cami and a slip under my dress, but it would never look as good without a proper &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>After sleeping on it overnight, I wake up to a mane full of waves that I could wear as-is</li>
            <li>smells fabulous worth every penny</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smelling pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a new territory for me to enjoy my curls :)</li>
            <li>Great product, keeps my hair&#x27;s natural wave (think beach waves) while keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Thank you for quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and as described....</li>
            <li>While this product does make my hair very soft, I really hoped that I would only have to use this one product to keep my curls looking perfect.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time tonight and when I was blow drying noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>so it is much better for your hair than normal product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>Potion 9 is the leave-in treatment that I can&#x27;t live without, but the price here is even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been perming my hair for the last 10 years and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that has helped reduce my static hair in the winter!</li>
            <li>After using Potion 9 on my hair, I use a little bit of Argan oil not on the roots though and my hair looks reaaally nice and healthy..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely, rarely even comb/brush my hair.</li>
            <li>I rarely, rarely even comb/brush my hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>Hold my curls wells, feels soft to the touch, defines and keep it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>so you need to find the right amount for your hair type.  </li>
            <li>Service &#x27;right on&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Great product for letting naturally curly hair air dry.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my very curly natural hair - it provides curl definition without a sticky or stiff hold.</li>
            <li>In the past 2 years, I switched hair dressers and while at first she did a GREAT job</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that is fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get it in my local drugstore anymore, so I was happy to find it online in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Just rub it in and toss, always pretty.</li>
            <li>My hair is even better on the second day.  </li>
            <li>My hair had had it at that point and that night it totally broke off everywhere and thinned out even more.  </li>
            <li>My first order was July 31, 2012...</li>
            <li>Decided to take a chance on potion 9 as a styling product and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>With a nickel-sized pump of this product in my damp hair, it blowdries not only into sleek perfection, but with more volume and body than I ever had without.</li>
            <li>This is a awesome treatment for preparing your hair to be straightened &amp; styled especially for African American hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m an avid shopper at amazon.</li>
            <li>and it only gets better each time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought it from a non-salon store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of curl products.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, buy a trial size first and test it out.</li>
            <li>Came on time and it is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair product, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Right now I have straight hair</li>
            <li>and it makes your curls tame and gorgeous all day</li>
            <li>Finding this product was like winning the lottery - it has completely changed how I manage my naturally curly and often out of control hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to let my hair air dry and get curls or consistent waves, but now I can.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>IT is worth EVERY penny--not only with how my hair looks, but how fast and easy it is to be professionally ready.</li>
            <li>Love this for my long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and have been a long time user.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I still use it with my short haircut, it gives weightless body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>You can apply it when getting out from the bath directly before going to bed or to the streets, it&#x27;ll give you that shine look exactly like just gotten out of the bath even hours after it!</li>
            <li>a great combo of put together and a little wild (I&#x27;ve accepted wild</li>
            <li>It makes my hair much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have used this product when I have had both curly hair and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I will say that if you put too much product on it will make hair crunchy or crispy</li>
            <li>and it really tames it!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>everytime instead of just at the root, so WAY too much overprocessing.  </li>
            <li>I found a tube of this left for free in my gym.  </li>
            <li>and I am meeting ready.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the humidity, i still need to use a smoother, but it does hold my curl well.</li>
            <li>Was very upset about it as never happened before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and holds your curls up all day and treats your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>I really holds my hair well without the crunchy look.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with amazon as usual.  </li>
            <li>That is the real savings.</li>
            <li>It was a fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I use just a little(too much makes it sticky)  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much as my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>Smelled nice but otherwise a waste.</li>
            <li>I usually just dampen my hair with some water and the curls are good as new.</li>
            <li>It is easy to style my long curly hair with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40s and my hair texture was coarsening significantly, but this product has completely reversed the coarseness.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, and this helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I tried many other products when I could no longer find it in stores and nothing even came close.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair in place better then other products.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair really curly for most of the day just like I had gotten a perm by just scrunching it upside down and air drying.</li>
            <li>This actually works at holding nice curl shape and once dry and scrunched through it feels and looks like...</li>
            <li>Great for thick, coarse hair that has a tendency to have too much volume</li>
            <li>Mild scent, good frizz control, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, sticky, or oily like some other products.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh down my hair and keeps it shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>Using Potion no. 9, it looks great whether I allow it to air dry or blow dry and flat iron it straight.</li>
            <li>I have curly freezy hair and this is the only product that keeps it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Unless the humidity is super high, it is the ONLY product I now use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend as have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until one time, I asked her to lighten the highlight a bit for summer and she completely bleached it way too much.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it very flexible and moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my long curly hair and I always come back to this.</li>
            <li>I have use it everyday for more than 8 years.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product from Amazon, the consistency just didn&#x27;t seem right, it was VERY watered down compared to normal.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried numerous products to try to tame my frizz and make my hair easier to deal with and I can honestly say that nothing makes as much of a difference as Sebastian Potion 9.</li>
            <li>Other products I recommend to use in conjunction with potion 9 are Deva Curl styling cream or  Aveda smooth infusion.</li>
            <li>This might be my new staple for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>one is new.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I can find the large size with pump!</li>
            <li>The straight hair lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that it drys quickly and holds my dry hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>And keeps my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>my natural hair!</li>
            <li>I used to straighten my hair when important meetings came around because my hair was always so frizzy, but now, I can just take it down from a pony tail</li>
            <li>Never stiff or frizzy.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, and the product does not leave my hair heavy.</li>
            <li>Now my seventeen year old daughter is also using it.</li>
            <li>The days I use anything else in order to use up my old products, I regret it.  </li>
            <li>THE SOFTEST THING EVER, seriously soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long stringy hair and this makes it so pretty and wavy.</li>
            <li>The hair maintains its natural form and it does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>it controls my curls all day and makes them touchably soft.</li>
            <li>This product helps my wavy to curly hair maintain it&#x27;s natural look while taming frizz.</li>
            <li>Working so far, keeping my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for water (my old styling product)  </li>
            <li>I use this instead of mousse or gel on my natural curls and this also is a leave in treatment</li>
            <li>It keeps the curls in place and they feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Silky, soft, smells yummy.</li>
            <li>If you have exceedingly thick, wildly curly hair, then there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted so much money looking for the right product to keep my curls together.</li>
            <li>product is not heavy or sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave any funny or flaky residue - I actually think it makes my coarse hair softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I use, then I simply twist the curls and let them air dry for a natural smooth look.</li>
            <li>I want to seriously meet the person who invented it and give them a huge hug!</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product and my hair went back to it normal, soft flowing hair within a week or two.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair is not weighted down; it is free flowing and at the same time not flyaway or frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this one that I bought through Amazon, my hair has become really brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li>I again decided to try this bottle of Potion 9 again, and again, my hair has become very brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li>A small dab of this, a small dab of a good gel and a diffuser - it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so worth it, this does tame and silken your curls, so you have soft shiney curls.  </li>
            <li>This was the real deal, no watering down of product and it definitely was the real Potion 9.</li>
            <li>I let it air dry for about an hour before giving it a quick scrunch to release a bit of the wet look and leave it be for the remainder of the day.</li>
            <li>taming products never worked right and my hair would look greasy or be a frizzy mess in no time.</li>
            <li>bottle is HUGE and lasts forever since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get the desired results either, so my hair never feels weighed down or greasy from it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to soft.</li>
            <li>Anyone with naturally curly hair should definitely try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much money looking for something cheaper</li>
            <li>Potion 9 leaves my hair soft, and the curls are defined into actual ringlets!</li>
            <li>After a while my son, a young teen at that time, started borrowing my Potion 9, and then he was hooked too.  </li>
            <li>Magic for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have not had tremendous luck in the past with &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; products everyone else seems to rave about.</li>
            <li>My hair is between straight and curly, and ends up extremely frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Also very economical compared to similar styling treatments as a small amount of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It has really cut my styling time down.  </li>
            <li>With Potion 9, I can let my hair dry naturally without it getting frizzy.</li>
            <li>If you put it on damp hair and let it air dry your hair will feel crispy and look stringy,  I was expecting soft curls.</li>
            <li>That said, at the present moment, they&#x27;re listing a 16 ounce bottle for 2 thousand 9 hundred 50 dollars ($2950.00) and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li>I have spent a few thousand dollars on all sorts of hair products in my lifetime and this is THE ONLY product that does exactly what I expect it to on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have short curly/wavy, relatively thin, fine, color treated hair.</li>

            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> love this for the hair!</li>
            <li> Love potion 9!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love what this does to my hair!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Potion9 is a leave in protein treatment I have been using for about 4 months and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing and the frizz is under control.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works amazing whether I want to scrunch my hair or straighten it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since an amazing hair stylist introduced me to it in the 90&#x27;s, and it remains my standby for a conditioning treatment/styling product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Plus, the price is nice.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product for my hair and works really well as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> that kind of a sacrifice</li>
            <li> Both of these products give my think hair a nice blow out.</li>
            <li> but it helps hold my awesome texture without too much hair expanding.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I don&#x27;t have the greatest hair and it definitely works well for me-</li>
            <li> Excellent products and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Provides a nice level of moisture and controls flyaway strands while reducing the appearance of split ends.</li>
            <li> I do get nice ringlets, but again, they are crunchy.  </li>
            <li> But, that is my own issue, not the product.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I had a very good stylist who first used it on my hair</li>
            <li> Great product and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for over 15 years, and I can honestly say, I am 100% confident I will never replace it for another product.</li>
            <li> By far the best product and price!</li>
            <li> My hair is still as great as when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, no other words:)  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on Amazon and will use nothing else from now on.</li>
            <li> The price is so much better in the salon</li>
            <li> and I love the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is weightless on your hair.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal ! ! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> love love...</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I LOVE Potion 9 for this purpose.</li>
            <li> and I had to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am glad someone told me about this product...</li>
            <li> Ok, I wrote a review on Sebastian&#x27;s Drench shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.</li>

            <li> the product arrived in good conditions and exactly like I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for years and found it to be the greatest product for putting into my curly hair and letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a hair conditioner / restorer / fixer so easy to use and keeping the hair healthy</li>
            <li> so if you have a beautiful natural curl I highly recommend it-and even if you don&#x27;t, it still does exceptionally well:)</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive Hair this would work great for you.</li>

            <li> It has a wonderful scent and really makes my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a salon size, but with the pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years on my curly and strong hair.</li>

            <li> I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used for natural wavy soft hair style.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so silky and smooth but never greasy.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> My hair goes to about the bottom of my shoulder blades, so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product to make it effective.</li>
            <li> After finger combing the product into my hair, I lightly scrunch my hair to help the curls set.</li>
            <li> Just the same great results day after day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I shared a bottle of crappy cheap shampoo during the cruise</li>
            <li> and I shared a bottle of crappy cheap shampoo during the cruise</li>
            <li> It is still great for my very big, frizzy, curly, out of control hair.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product .</li>
            <li> At any price this is a fabulous holding sprays</li>
            <li> I tried it and after only 3 applications in 3 weeks, I can see a great improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> the kind they sell in grocery stores isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to give you the &amp;#34;wild curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Is a fantastic product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> Rthank you so much ! ! !</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now and find it to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff - I have used it for years - it makes your hair soft but holds it in place really well</li>
            <li> Smells so clean.</li>
            <li> special note:  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say there is no other hair product that I LOVE as much as Sebastian Potion 9!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not heavy or lingering.</li>
            <li> My hair has already grown about 2-3 full inches (which it never does).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never found it to be true.  </li>
            <li> I would still wear a cami and a slip under my dress, but it would never look as good without a proper &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> After sleeping on it overnight, I wake up to a mane full of waves that I could wear as-is</li>
            <li> smells fabulous worth every penny</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smelling pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a new territory for me to enjoy my curls :)</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my hair&#x27;s natural wave (think beach waves) while keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Thank you for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as described....</li>
            <li> While this product does make my hair very soft, I really hoped that I would only have to use this one product to keep my curls looking perfect.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time tonight and when I was blow drying noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> so it is much better for your hair than normal product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Potion 9 is the leave-in treatment that I can&#x27;t live without, but the price here is even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been perming my hair for the last 10 years and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that has helped reduce my static hair in the winter!</li>
            <li> After using Potion 9 on my hair, I use a little bit of Argan oil not on the roots though and my hair looks reaaally nice and healthy..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely, rarely even comb/brush my hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely, rarely even comb/brush my hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> Hold my curls wells, feels soft to the touch, defines and keep it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> so you need to find the right amount for your hair type.  </li>
            <li> Service &#x27;right on&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great product for letting naturally curly hair air dry.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my very curly natural hair - it provides curl definition without a sticky or stiff hold.</li>
            <li> In the past 2 years, I switched hair dressers and while at first she did a GREAT job</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that is fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it in my local drugstore anymore, so I was happy to find it online in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Just rub it in and toss, always pretty.</li>
            <li> My hair is even better on the second day.  </li>
            <li> My hair had had it at that point and that night it totally broke off everywhere and thinned out even more.  </li>
            <li> My first order was July 31, 2012...</li>
            <li> Decided to take a chance on potion 9 as a styling product and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> With a nickel-sized pump of this product in my damp hair, it blowdries not only into sleek perfection, but with more volume and body than I ever had without.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome treatment for preparing your hair to be straightened &amp; styled especially for African American hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m an avid shopper at amazon.</li>
            <li> and it only gets better each time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought it from a non-salon store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of curl products.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, buy a trial size first and test it out.</li>
            <li> Came on time and it is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Right now I have straight hair</li>
            <li> and it makes your curls tame and gorgeous all day</li>
            <li> Finding this product was like winning the lottery - it has completely changed how I manage my naturally curly and often out of control hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to let my hair air dry and get curls or consistent waves, but now I can.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> IT is worth EVERY penny--not only with how my hair looks, but how fast and easy it is to be professionally ready.</li>
            <li> Love this for my long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and have been a long time user.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I still use it with my short haircut, it gives weightless body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> You can apply it when getting out from the bath directly before going to bed or to the streets, it&#x27;ll give you that shine look exactly like just gotten out of the bath even hours after it!</li>
            <li> a great combo of put together and a little wild (I&#x27;ve accepted wild</li>
            <li> It makes my hair much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product when I have had both curly hair and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I will say that if you put too much product on it will make hair crunchy or crispy</li>
            <li> and it really tames it!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> everytime instead of just at the root, so WAY too much overprocessing.  </li>
            <li> I found a tube of this left for free in my gym.  </li>
            <li> and I am meeting ready.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the humidity, i still need to use a smoother, but it does hold my curl well.</li>
            <li> Was very upset about it as never happened before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and holds your curls up all day and treats your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I really holds my hair well without the crunchy look.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with amazon as usual.  </li>
            <li> That is the real savings.</li>
            <li> It was a fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but I use just a little(too much makes it sticky)  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much as my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> Smelled nice but otherwise a waste.</li>
            <li> I usually just dampen my hair with some water and the curls are good as new.</li>
            <li> It is easy to style my long curly hair with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40s and my hair texture was coarsening significantly, but this product has completely reversed the coarseness.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, and this helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried many other products when I could no longer find it in stores and nothing even came close.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair in place better then other products.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair really curly for most of the day just like I had gotten a perm by just scrunching it upside down and air drying.</li>
            <li> This actually works at holding nice curl shape and once dry and scrunched through it feels and looks like...</li>
            <li> Great for thick, coarse hair that has a tendency to have too much volume</li>
            <li> Mild scent, good frizz control, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, sticky, or oily like some other products.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair and keeps it shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> Using Potion no. 9, it looks great whether I allow it to air dry or blow dry and flat iron it straight.</li>
            <li> I have curly freezy hair and this is the only product that keeps it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Unless the humidity is super high, it is the ONLY product I now use.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend as have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until one time, I asked her to lighten the highlight a bit for summer and she completely bleached it way too much.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it very flexible and moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my long curly hair and I always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have use it everyday for more than 8 years.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product from Amazon, the consistency just didn&#x27;t seem right, it was VERY watered down compared to normal.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried numerous products to try to tame my frizz and make my hair easier to deal with and I can honestly say that nothing makes as much of a difference as Sebastian Potion 9.</li>
            <li> Other products I recommend to use in conjunction with potion 9 are Deva Curl styling cream or  Aveda smooth infusion.</li>
            <li> This might be my new staple for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> one is new.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can find the large size with pump!</li>
            <li> The straight hair lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that it drys quickly and holds my dry hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> And keeps my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my hair when important meetings came around because my hair was always so frizzy, but now, I can just take it down from a pony tail</li>
            <li> Never stiff or frizzy.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, and the product does not leave my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> Now my seventeen year old daughter is also using it.</li>
            <li> The days I use anything else in order to use up my old products, I regret it.  </li>
            <li> THE SOFTEST THING EVER, seriously soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long stringy hair and this makes it so pretty and wavy.</li>
            <li> The hair maintains its natural form and it does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> it controls my curls all day and makes them touchably soft.</li>
            <li> This product helps my wavy to curly hair maintain it&#x27;s natural look while taming frizz.</li>
            <li> Working so far, keeping my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for water (my old styling product)  </li>
            <li> I use this instead of mousse or gel on my natural curls and this also is a leave in treatment</li>
            <li> It keeps the curls in place and they feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Silky, soft, smells yummy.</li>
            <li> If you have exceedingly thick, wildly curly hair, then there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted so much money looking for the right product to keep my curls together.</li>
            <li> product is not heavy or sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave any funny or flaky residue - I actually think it makes my coarse hair softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I use, then I simply twist the curls and let them air dry for a natural smooth look.</li>
            <li> I want to seriously meet the person who invented it and give them a huge hug!</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product and my hair went back to it normal, soft flowing hair within a week or two.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair is not weighted down; it is free flowing and at the same time not flyaway or frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this one that I bought through Amazon, my hair has become really brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> I again decided to try this bottle of Potion 9 again, and again, my hair has become very brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> A small dab of this, a small dab of a good gel and a diffuser - it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so worth it, this does tame and silken your curls, so you have soft shiney curls.  </li>
            <li> This was the real deal, no watering down of product and it definitely was the real Potion 9.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry for about an hour before giving it a quick scrunch to release a bit of the wet look and leave it be for the remainder of the day.</li>
            <li> taming products never worked right and my hair would look greasy or be a frizzy mess in no time.</li>
            <li> bottle is HUGE and lasts forever since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get the desired results either, so my hair never feels weighed down or greasy from it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to soft.</li>
            <li> Anyone with naturally curly hair should definitely try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent much money looking for something cheaper</li>
            <li> Potion 9 leaves my hair soft, and the curls are defined into actual ringlets!</li>
            <li> After a while my son, a young teen at that time, started borrowing my Potion 9, and then he was hooked too.  </li>
            <li> Magic for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have not had tremendous luck in the past with &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; products everyone else seems to rave about.</li>
            <li> My hair is between straight and curly, and ends up extremely frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Also very economical compared to similar styling treatments as a small amount of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has really cut my styling time down.  </li>
            <li> With Potion 9, I can let my hair dry naturally without it getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you put it on damp hair and let it air dry your hair will feel crispy and look stringy,  I was expecting soft curls.</li>
            <li> That said, at the present moment, they&#x27;re listing a 16 ounce bottle for 2 thousand 9 hundred 50 dollars ($2950.00) and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li> I have spent a few thousand dollars on all sorts of hair products in my lifetime and this is THE ONLY product that does exactly what I expect it to on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have short curly/wavy, relatively thin, fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my damp hair and let it air dry for a bit, a little heat with a diffuser, and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> Really works to both tame my mop and keep it conditioned.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with wave/curl that is too loose, inconsistent, and frizzy to wear naturally.</li>
            <li> my scalp is very oily, my bottom half of my hair very dry and</li>
            <li> I put this on when my hair is wet, just scrunch it in and let it dry naturally -</li>
            <li> this size should last you for around 6 months, even if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it to flat iron my daughter and I hair.</li>
            <li> I know the initial price looks intimidating, but not only does this bottle last for months, it also saves on not having to buy other product.</li>

            <li> have very long hair and only use a pea-sized amount.  </li>
            <li> This only applies if you do not blow dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> so last a long long time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so for those who say it weighs the hair down, are using too much product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years: back when my hair was long I just washed and applied this stuff and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I have long very curly hair that can get frizzy and be hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> No need to flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> it has become harder to get locally.</li>
            <li> I have been using Potion 9 for my hair for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> I put it in my wet hair, and I use it on following days to refresh my curls between washings.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t hold the curls for long.  </li>
            <li> I have curly long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and, after years of trying products that would keep my spiral curls together without turning my head into a giant flammable wick, I found it at a salon and never looked back!</li>
            <li> I am half Mexican, a quarter Indian, and a quarter German...</li>
            <li> me, I usually shower at night during my work week since I have to get very early.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it worth it!</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair</li>
            <li> It is somewhat damaged and dry because of the coloring</li>
            <li> It does not look dry, does not have fly-aways, and does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry hair for flyaways</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product as a leave-in conditioner to see if it could help my extremely dry ends.</li>
            <li> I should note that I do not blow dry my hair, nor does my daughter, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work then.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really dry from bleaching.</li>
            <li> For the past few months, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and spent hundreds of dollars on leave in conditioners, hot oils, you name it.  </li>
            <li> The breakage has definitely slowed down and now those strands are growing out making my hair thicker.  </li>
            <li> I personally use the Drench shampoo and conditioner along with this product, but if I had to choose because of the expense, I would take the Potion #9 hands down.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but it does make my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> Once dry, scrunch your hair for a bit by the fistfuls and voila!</li>
            <li> It does not matter if you use it on wet or dry hair it does its job.</li>
            <li> You will not regret about buying this item, my hair is very dry</li>
            <li> I just spritz my hair with a little water and apply the product and the curls bounce back into shape!</li>
            <li> It seemed expensive to me at first, but it last us about 3-4 months, and I have not purchased any other hair products since I started buying it.  </li>
            <li> I would be shocked if you too didn&#x27;t fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It adds moisture, tames frizz, defines and holds my curls without making them feel crunchy, look wet or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find a place to buy it.  </li>
            <li> wet hair and all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t t get the thickness back until I have used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> (I tend to do a messy bun on the second day after washing</li>
            <li> just put on when your hair is wet</li>
            <li> and i used this product for a couple weeks but not much changed.</li>
            <li> I just work a small amount into towel-dried hair, then upside down blowdry while softly scrunching hair.</li>
            <li> May seem a little spendy, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish using my other products</li>
            <li> but I will tell you it takes such a small amount each time you use it</li>
            <li> It also helps with Frizzies though there are other products for that.</li>
            <li> Then I use whatever other product I want depending on how I am styling.</li>
            <li> My hair blew out shinier and smoother than with any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> On set or wet hair it&#x27;s the beat leave in!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 starts is that I am not sure I have figured out how to use to product to maximize results.  </li>
            <li> Serums, smoothers, and other curl</li>
            <li> Leaves other products like Moroccan Oil in the dust.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with some control and lots of shine with only a small amount needed.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on wet hair or as a finisher on dry hair (which is usually how I use it.)  </li>
            <li> I moved recently and my hair has NOT liked the change in climate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair is still damp from showering, I put about a 3/4 pump (don&#x27;t press the pump all the way down) and then start with my ends and work the product up throughout the rest of my hair up to the scalp.</li>
            <li> It has never felt weighted down with product build up, and I continue to get rave comments about my hair.</li>
            <li> It has never felt weighted down with product build up, and I continue to get rave comments about my hair.</li>
            <li> I blowdry whenever I want to wear it down, but humidity is still my mortal enemy.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down not up</li>
            <li> is what I look like unless I&#x27;m embracing a flat iron/blow dryer/curling iron--which I hardly ever do)</li>
            <li> Because TSA took my product (4.1 ounce bottle that was half full)during a differnt trip, I didn&#x27;t dare take my Drench set with me.</li>

            <li> I finally decided I would not pay their ridiculous prices anymore and found it on Amazon for $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, less dry, less tangled, less dull.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and noticed my hair calming down.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has tight curly hair.  </li>
            <li> TreSemme firm hold hair spray ( black aeresol can).</li>
            <li> It calms it down, yet does not make it stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little pricey, but</li>
            <li> The little bit in the bottom of the tube has lasted almost a year.  </li>
            <li> And it gives a little body.</li>
            <li> It does the job but leaves my hair feeling a little funky.</li>
            <li> Puts a little weight so hair is not frizzy.</li>
            <li> and now I use it everyday to keep my hair from frizzing out or just being a plain mess.  </li>
            <li> After returning to my natural brown, cutting back on heat styling, and using this product, it&#x27;s hard to believe how my hair used to look compared to now.</li>
            <li> It dries crunchy, but a few hair scrunchings</li>
            <li> I use to be harsh with the brushing--always in a rush.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> When my hair dries it is SOOO shiny and bouncy and curls are softly defined--it literally looks fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> For a while I tried using other stuff because I had a hard time finding someplace that sold it.</li>
            <li> If it feels a bit stiff in areas after it dries, just run your fingers through it and you are set.</li>
            <li> If it gets tossed with the wind, throw some water on it and the product will tame my hair again.  </li>
            <li> Not easily found in stores</li>
            <li> I have always had LONG, VERY thick hair...</li>
            <li> Sebastian Potion 9 never failed to keep all frizz away--I have a bad case of frizz.</li>
            <li> I just used small amount</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have been devastated and will not be going back to her or highlighting my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, I always fall for what the hairdresser suggests and then it never works or I&#x27;m disappointed and for the price of salon products--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone lazy for a while and stop using it and with the heat in Bikram yoga</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say that I am not pleased at all with this.</li>
            <li> can tell it&#x27;s making a difference because for the past couple days people have been asking me if I was blowdrying it.</li>

            <li> It makes your hair really curly for most of the day just like I had gotten a perm by just scrunching it upside down and air drying. Just wish it would last until I had to wash my hair again!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and this tames my frizz. It dries crunchy, but a few hair scrunchings and it&#x27;s back to soft. The scent is light, and the product does not leave my hair heavy. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair goop over the years, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Plus, the price is nice.</li>
            <li> I always use this for my curly hair. Just rub it in and toss, always pretty. Never stiff or frizzy. Smells nice but not heavy or lingering.</li>
            <li> Good product as described. Will buy it again and recommend others to try it. It makes my hair much healthier.</li>
            <li> While this product does make my hair very soft, I really hoped that I would only have to use this one product to keep my curls looking perfect.  For me, it wasn&#x27;t that easy and I still have to use another product to keep my curls from looking frizzy.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but it does make my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and often breaks off halfway down my head.  I use to be harsh with the brushing--always in a rush.  Potion9 is a leave in protein treatment I have been using for about 4 months and it is amazing.  My hair has already grown about 2-3 full inches (which it never does).  Look and feels healthier, thicker and definitely more attractive.  The breakage has definitely slowed down and now those strands are growing out making my hair thicker.  This might be my new staple for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> A lot of retailers no longer sell this product which is a shame.  It is a wonderful product for my hair and works really well as a leave in conditioner.  It does not weigh down my hair and keeps it shiny and healthy.  I tried many other products when I could no longer find it in stores and nothing even came close.  I was glad to find it on Amazon and will use nothing else from now on.</li>
            <li> The price is so much better in the salon and I love the product.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. I&#x27;ve used this for a few years: back when my hair was long I just washed and applied this stuff and let it dry naturally. No frizz, crunchy hold that you could finger-comb out to soften. I still use it with my short haircut, it gives weightless body to my fine hair. Contains conditioners, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or make my hair look stringy.</li>
            <li> A great product. Mild scent, good frizz control, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, sticky, or oily like some other products.</li>
            <li> This product is not work at all. I bought two of them. But tryed to cancel one of them. One I just used small amount one is new. Seller will never connect with you about cancel for purchase. Too bad!</li>
            <li> I like this bc it softens the hair and smells fine. I have curly hair that I tend to condition often to soften the texture.</li>
            <li> I love this stuf!! I use it to curl my wavy hair and it is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t make it hard like gel does. Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product when I have had both curly hair and straight hair.  It is great for both hair types.  I will say that if you put too much product on it will make hair crunchy or crispy so you need to find the right amount for your hair type.  This only applies if you do not blow dry your hair.  Right now I have straight hair and I use a dime size amount and only for my ends.  I was introduced to the product by my hair dresser 20 years ago. We both still swear by it.</li>
            <li> Love this for my long curly hair.  It is the best product I have found on the market to date!</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my hair&#x27;s natural wave (think beach waves) while keeping my hair soft. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my very curly natural hair - it provides curl definition without a sticky or stiff hold. I wish I discovered this product years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years but have been unable to find it at the salon. Now my seventeen year old daughter is also using it. Love this product and it is weightless on your hair.</li>
            <li> Awsome ! ! ! Such a great deal ! ! ! Rthank you so much ! ! !</li>
            <li> Anyone with naturally curly hair should definitely try this. I use it in combination with Kenra glaze mouse and it tames my curls without leaving the overuse of product look</li>
            <li> Great Hair conditioner !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. It leaves my hair so silky and smooth but never greasy. Amazon is the only place I can find the large size with pump!</li>
            <li> The best hair treatment ever</li>
            <li> Great stuff - I have used it for years - it makes your hair soft but holds it in place really well</li>
            <li> Love it for my wavy/curly hair!!! My hair is even better on the second day.  Even after being pulled back in a bun all evening I can rejuvenate my curls the next day with this product.  I just spritz my hair with a little water and apply the product and the curls bounce back into shape!</li>
            <li> I could do a commercial about this product!  I have dry curly hair and it really tames it!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love...</li>
            <li> My go to hair product!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan. I learned about it on Paula Begoun&#x27;s podcast (author of \\&quot;The Cosmetics Cop\\&quot;). She hosted a hair specialist, who said Potion no. 9 is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; product for anyone with unruly, frizzy hair. I agree! I use it everyday now. The days I use anything else in order to use up my old products, I regret it.  My hair is wavy, highlighted, fairly thin in circumference, but it is fairly thick. It is somewhat damaged and dry because of the coloring and I always had fly-aways and frizz with any hint of humidity. Using Potion no. 9, it looks great whether I allow it to air dry or blow dry and flat iron it straight. It does not look dry, does not have fly-aways, and does not get frizzy. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Where do I start....I have always had LONG, VERY thick hair...dirty blonde but have gotten highlights since I was about 14/15 (I&#x27;m 25 now).  In the past 2 years, I switched hair dressers and while at first she did a GREAT job, I started feeling like my hair was thinning and breaking.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until one time, I asked her to lighten the highlight a bit for summer and she completely bleached it way too much.  I also realized she was highlighting the entire thing everytime instead of just at the root, so WAY too much overprocessing.  My hair had had it at that point and that night it totally broke off everywhere and thinned out even more.  To make matters worse, it killed my hair to the point where it is course and hard no matter what.  Needless to say, I have been devastated and will not be going back to her or highlighting my hair anymore.  For the past few months, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and spent hundreds of dollars on leave in conditioners, hot oils, you name it.  It&#x27;s worked okay but NOTHING has gotten my hair back to the silky texture like this product.  I just used it for the first time tonight and when I was blow drying noticed a huge difference.  I am so happy I found this product.  I want to seriously meet the person who invented it and give them a huge hug!</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been a long time user. My hair feels amazing and the frizz is under control.</li>
            <li> Potion #9 is a miracle product for curly hair! I love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only product I use, then I simply twist the curls and let them air dry for a natural smooth look. I constantly get compliments. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find in salons and beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Holds my wavy curls!!</li>
            <li> If you have exceedingly thick, wildly curly hair, then there&#x27;s nothing better.  I&#x27;ve spent much money looking for something cheaper and I&#x27;m here to say it just DOESN&#x27;T EXIST.  That said, at the present moment, they&#x27;re listing a 16 ounce bottle for 2 thousand 9 hundred 50 dollars ($2950.00) and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth that kind of a sacrifice (!!!)</li>
            <li> Potion 9 is the leave-in treatment that I can&#x27;t live without, but the price here is even better.</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for over 15 years, and I can honestly say, I am 100% confident I will never replace it for another product. EVER! I have fine, naturally curly hair. If I use a different product, my hair is a frizz fest. Potion 9 leaves my hair soft, and the curls are defined into actual ringlets! I just work a small amount into towel-dried hair, then upside down blowdry while softly scrunching hair. It is amazing. May seem a little spendy, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time. Try it! Its worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> O.K. so it&#x27;s a little pricey, but so worth it, this does tame and silken your curls, so you have soft shiney curls.  You will need extra on humid days, I just add mousse  or Mixed Chicks products with it those days.</li>
            <li> I found a tube of this left for free in my gym.  I tried it after a shower and couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair looked.  Yoink!  Mine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair and only use a pea-sized amount.  I know that hair care products always say that but I&#x27;ve never found it to be true.  The little bit in the bottom of the tube has lasted almost a year.  I&#x27;ll finish using my other products but I can&#x27;t imagine life without this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it for years. This was the real deal, no watering down of product and it definitely was the real Potion 9.</li>
            <li> I have spent a few thousand dollars on all sorts of hair products in my lifetime and this is THE ONLY product that does exactly what I expect it to on my naturally curly hair.  It adds moisture, tames frizz, defines and holds my curls without making them feel crunchy, look wet or feel greasy.  You can use it on wet hair or as a finisher on dry hair (which is usually how I use it.)  I agree that it is a bit expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.  special note:  this product is a MUST to try on biracial childrens&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry hair for flyaways</li>
            <li> I have long very curly hair that can get frizzy and be hard to deal with. Over the years I have tried numerous products to try to tame my frizz and make my hair easier to deal with and I can honestly say that nothing makes as much of a difference as Sebastian Potion 9. This is my go to product and I NEVER let myself run out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is HUGE and lasts forever since a little goes a long way. The product smells great, and feels even better in my hair. I can honestly say there is no other hair product that I LOVE as much as Sebastian Potion 9!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for YEARS!  Really works to both tame my mop and keep it conditioned. If it feels a bit stiff in areas after it dries, just run your fingers through it and you are set.</li>
            <li> I have short curly/wavy, relatively thin, fine, color treated hair. I&#x27;ve wasted so much money looking for the right product to keep my curls together. I LOVE Potion 9 for this purpose. My hairdresser gave me a sample of it and I had to buy more. You don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get the desired results either, so my hair never feels weighed down or greasy from it. If the curls fall apart at any point (wearing a hoodie, wind, etc.) I usually just dampen my hair with some water and the curls are good as new. Love this product! Never wasting money again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Sebastian products.  I started using them when my hairstylist recommended approximately 5 years ago. I have not used anything else since. Leaves my hair soft and smelling really good. I believe since I started tbis product line it&#x27;s actually improved the texture of my curly hair.  You may feel it&#x27;s a bit expensive but I will tell you it takes such a small amount each time you use it so last a long long time.  Try it you&#x27;ll Love It!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 13 years and always loved it. I have curly freezy hair and this is the only product that keeps it smooth and soft. For a while I tried using other stuff because I had a hard time finding someplace that sold it. Well, I am back.</li>
            <li> Excellent, no other words:)  I have used this product for several years now and find it to be very effective.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used it for many years.  It is getting harder to find a place to buy it.  Hair Cuttery and Walgreens used to sell it, but no longer.  I did a google search and found Amazon had a way to puchase it.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product !! Highly recommend as have been using for years. Will leave your hair feeling and looking amazing consistently</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used for natural wavy soft hair style.  I am glad someone told me about this product...I have been using it for several years!!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner EVER. Don&#x27;t look any further! I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 8 years and it&#x27;s always been great.</li>
            <li> Ok, I wrote a review on Sebastian&#x27;s Drench shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love it. I took a chance on this product as a leave-in conditioner to see if it could help my extremely dry ends. I am half Mexican, a quarter Indian, and a quarter German...my scalp is very oily, my bottom half of my hair very dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair is still damp from showering, I put about a 3/4 pump (don&#x27;t press the pump all the way down) and then start with my ends and work the product up throughout the rest of my hair up to the scalp. My hair goes to about the bottom of my shoulder blades, so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product to make it effective. After finger combing the product into my hair, I lightly scrunch my hair to help the curls set. And literally...that is it! When my hair dries it is SOOO shiny and bouncy and curls are softly defined--it literally looks fake it looks so good. And so you know, I have NEVER liked my hair. This is a new territory for me to enjoy my curls :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I usually shower at night during my work week since I have to get very early. I do the same technique at night and then just go to bed--wet hair and all. When I wake up in the morning...BAM! Gorgeous curls! I am so in love with this product. I hope Sebastian never changes it. IT is worth EVERY penny--not only with how my hair looks, but how fast and easy it is to be professionally ready. I used to straighten my hair when important meetings came around because my hair was always so frizzy, but now, I can just take it down from a pony tail and I am meeting ready. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I have used this product now for two months--no limb, over-producted hair. Just the same great results day after day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE March 13, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I am finally ordering my second bottle of this wonder product. My first order was July 31, 2012...I am finally about 15% left in my bottle. My hair is still as great as when I first tried this product. It has never felt weighted down with product build up, and I continue to get rave comments about my hair. I personally use the Drench shampoo and conditioner along with this product, but if I had to choose because of the expense, I would take the Potion #9 hands down. Case in point, my sister and I went on a Caribbean cruise last October. Because TSA took my product (4.1 ounce bottle that was half full)during a differnt trip, I didn&#x27;t dare take my Drench set with me. My sis and I shared a bottle of crappy cheap shampoo during the cruise and I used Potion #9. It honestly saved my hair during the trip! I know the initial price looks intimidating, but not only does this bottle last for months, it also saves on not having to buy other product. I have no hair spray, mousse, gel, nada. I literally just wash/condition in the shower and then run Potion #9 through my hair and I am done. I rarely, rarely even comb/brush my hair. Just the combing through with my fingers usually is enough to set my curls. It is seriously a blessing to have taken a chance on this product. I am a Sebastian Gal all the way!roduct.

            <li> I love this product! I have used this for about 10- 15 yrs. and I love that you can find just about anything on amazon, because over the yrs. it has become harder to get locally.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff 20 years ago and just rediscovered it.  It is still great for my very big, frizzy, curly, out of control hair.  It calms it down, yet does not make it stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent! My hair is between straight and curly, and ends up extremely frizzy.  I&#x27;ve never been able to let my hair air dry and get curls or consistent waves, but now I can.  This is fabulous, and will save my hair from heat styling and damage.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and my hair loves it. I moved recently and my hair has NOT liked the change in climate. I have tried numerous shampoos and conditioners without luck. I used this for a few days and noticed my hair calming down. My hair is less frizzy, less dry, less tangled, less dull.</li>
            <li> Such a great product . It is easy to style my long curly hair with it</li>
            <li> Not so good. Made my hair sticky and hard...</li>
            <li> I have been using potion 9 for about 20 years( maybe longer?). There is nothing else on the market that compares and I have tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin wavy hair and it thickens my hair after a few uses. I know this since when I get my hair colored it &amp;#34;strips&amp;#34; it off and I don&#x27;t t get the thickness back until I have used it for a few days. The smell is delightful. It also helps with Frizzies though there are other products for that. This product helps with condition and holding in moisture as well. I use 1 pump between my palms and distribute with my two hands. Then I use whatever other product I want depending on how I am styling. Potion number 9 is always my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s sort of like a good bra. I would still wear a cami and a slip under my dress, but it would never look as good without a proper &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;. I think of potion 9 like that. Other products I recommend to use in conjunction with potion 9 are Deva Curl styling cream or  Aveda smooth infusion. Both of these products give my think hair a nice blow out. I finish with TreSemme firm hold hair spray ( black aeresol can). At any price this is a fabulous holding sprays</li>
            <li> Been buying this stuff for over a decade and cannot run out.  It battles humidity and leaves hair smelling great and looking good.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, I always fall for what the hairdresser suggests and then it never works or I&#x27;m disappointed and for the price of salon products--thats such a bummer. Anyway, this stuff is great. It doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the humidity, i still need to use a smoother, but it does hold my curl well. It doesn&#x27;t add curl or volume (I have think curly hair, I don&#x27;t want something that is going to add to it) but it does some defining and definitely makes my hair THE SOFTEST THING EVER, seriously soft. It makes it look touchable and a great combo of put together and a little wild (I&#x27;ve accepted wild is what I look like unless I&#x27;m embracing a flat iron/blow dryer/curling iron--which I hardly ever do) but it helps hold my awesome texture without too much hair expanding.</li>
            <li> I helps detangle my hair. And it gives a little body. I love it! Good price from this sellter. Thank you for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist who has unmanageable frizzy coarse hair. Decided to take a chance on potion 9 as a styling product and used it for the first time today. My hair blew out shinier and smoother than with any other product I have used. No need to flat iron!!! In love!</li>
            <li> I have always loved potion 9.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I don&#x27;t have the greatest hair and it definitely works well for me- so if you have a beautiful natural curl I highly recommend it-and even if you don&#x27;t, it still does exceptionally well:)</li>
            <li> The ingredients on the Sebastian Potion 9 makes it wearable. You can apply it when getting out from the bath directly before going to bed or to the streets, it&#x27;ll give you that shine look exactly like just gotten out of the bath even hours after it!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used. It smells great and does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years and love it. It works amazing whether I want to scrunch my hair or straighten it out.</li>
            <li> With Potion 9, I can let my hair dry naturally without it getting frizzy. I just put it on once when my hair is damp and again before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> After a year and half search for a better hair product, this is the first one that impressed me, so nice. doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and hard. Keeps it very flexible and moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> It does the job but leaves my hair feeling a little funky.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your hair! I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper stuff but I always come back to Potion 9.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since an amazing hair stylist introduced me to it in the 90&#x27;s, and it remains my standby for a conditioning treatment/styling product.  A little goes a long way, so for those who say it weighs the hair down, are using too much product!  A bottle this size should last you for around 6 months, even if you have long hair.  Thanks for bringing a great product at an incredible price!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft after using this product. I&#x27;ve tried others products on my hair, but I do have to come back to this one!,, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is not weighted down; it is free flowing and at the same time not flyaway or frizzy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Had my hair highlighted only to have it damaged. Was told it was over processed. Was very upset about it as never happened before. Did my research and this product had great reviews. I tried it and after only 3 applications in 3 weeks, I can see a great improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s shiny and although I have to wait for the damaged part of my hair to grow out, it looks and feels so much better!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Magic for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Potion 9 for about 25 years and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  After a while my son, a young teen at that time, started borrowing my Potion 9, and then he was hooked too.  A couple of years later my husband decided to follow suit and join the Potion 9 team.  Now none of us would be without our Potion 9.</li>
            <li> LOVE this on my hair and my daughters hair. My daughter has long stringy hair and this makes it so pretty and wavy. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I live in a dry climate, and this helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Potion 9 is really a great product, quite satisfied! The hair maintains its natural form and it does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been perming my hair for the last 10 years and I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s light and holds your curls up all day and treats your hair at the same time. I&#x27;ve gone lazy for a while and stop using it and with the heat in Bikram yoga my hair went crazy dry with split ends. After the realization of my damaged hair I resumed using Sebastian Potion 9 again and my hair stylist is happy to see me again.</li>
            <li> I have not had tremendous luck in the past with &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; products everyone else seems to rave about. Ever the optimist, I keep trying. Finally, I have been rewarded! I cannot say enough about how this product has changed my hair! I have long hair with wave/curl that is too loose, inconsistent, and frizzy to wear naturally. I blowdry whenever I want to wear it down, but humidity is still my mortal enemy. With a nickel-sized pump of this product in my damp hair, it blowdries not only into sleek perfection, but with more volume and body than I ever had without. It&#x27;s as if I grew 50% more hair overnight. My split ends are greatly smoothed and improved, and the best part is that my &#x27;do defies humidity all day. After sleeping on it overnight, I wake up to a mane full of waves that I could wear as-is (I tend to do a messy bun on the second day after washing so I don&#x27;t have to strip it daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40s and my hair texture was coarsening significantly, but this product has completely reversed the coarseness. I truly love my hair again and Potion 9 gets the credit.</li>
            <li> If you put it on damp hair and let it air dry your hair will feel crispy and look stringy,  I was expecting soft curls.</li>
            <li> I have use this product forever.  A bit spendy but I have not found anything close to it.  Puts a little weight so hair is not frizzy.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS WORKS, I ADD WATER AND SPRAY IT ON DAMP HAIR</li>
            <li> This is a awesome treatment for preparing your hair to be straightened &amp; styled especially for African American hair. I use it to flat iron my daughter and I hair. The straight hair lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!! MY HAIR GOT HEALTHIER SUPER SHINNY!!! BEST PRODUCT EVER WILL BUY AGAIN AGAIN N AGAIN!!! PLUS ITS THE BEST PRICE I EVER SEEN!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is one of the best products I have ever used.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or make my hair crunchy.  it controls my curls all day and makes them touchably soft.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and have used this product for YEARS!  I really holds my hair well without the crunchy look.  If it gets tossed with the wind, throw some water on it and the product will tame my hair again.  Really great stuff!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it&#x27;s pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for 5 years. What I like about it is that it drys quickly and holds my dry hair in place all day. I work in a very windy area and do not have to worry about my hair being fly away when I go out during the day for business.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with amazon as usual.  product was excellent.  i believe this says it all.  i&#x27;m an avid shopper at amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use gel anymore! I use this instead. I have wavy hair. I scrunch my hair with this and use the diffuser and it looks amazing! Smell amazing! And keeps my hair so soft! Been using this for 5-6 years now!</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using this product for over 20 years. I have thick naturally curly hair and, after years of trying products that would keep my spiral curls together without turning my head into a giant flammable wick, I found it at a salon and never looked back! Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but you don&#x27;t need a crazy amount per use. Plus, the scent is divine, people always compliment me on it. Best product ever for keeping your curls together without turning them into plastic. I put this on when my hair is wet, just scrunch it in and let it dry naturally - please don&#x27;t blow-fry your curls! Once dry, scrunch your hair for a bit by the fistfuls and voila! Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Loved by the ladies so what the hey. Good product good price</li>
            <li> Excellent products and reasonably priced.  Service &#x27;right on&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Potion 9 for my hair for a long time now.  I had a very good stylist who first used it on my hair and now I use it everyday to keep my hair from frizzing out or just being a plain mess.  It is a good product and I buy it online because it is less expensive than in beauty supply stores and the kind they sell in grocery stores isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else. The best thing ever! Been using it for years and it only gets better each time. Now I want to check out what else is good from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Great product and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I used this after each shampoo for about two weeks. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Smelled nice but otherwise a waste.</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for several years now. This is the first time I have bought it from a non-salon store.  I am not sure what to think.  Since I started using this one that I bought through Amazon, my hair has become really brittle and dry.  I stopped using this product and my hair went back to it normal, soft flowing hair within a week or two.  I again decided to try this bottle of Potion 9 again, and again, my hair has become very brittle and dry.  I bought another bottle of Potion 9 from a salon and haven&#x27;t had a problem with it at all.  When I first started using this product from Amazon, the consistency just didn&#x27;t seem right, it was VERY watered down compared to normal.  I would have to say that I am not pleased at all with this.</li>
            <li> The best product i ever used for frizz</li>
            <li> I love this product, I always order it thru amazon because it&#x27;s the best price I can find.  This product helps my wavy to curly hair maintain it&#x27;s natural look while taming frizz.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle.  My daughter and I both use it.  I put it in my wet hair, and I use it on following days to refresh my curls between washings.  Unless the humidity is super high, it is the ONLY product I now use.  No more crazy mixing of four plus products that usually left my hair stiff.  It has really cut my styling time down.  I should note that I do not blow dry my hair, nor does my daughter, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work then.  I love it.  It seemed expensive to me at first, but it last us about 3-4 months, and I have not purchased any other hair products since I started buying it.  That is the real savings.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair hard and tangled.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to give you the &amp;#34;wild curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> love this for the hair!</li>
            <li> Wife love this stuff for her hair.</li>
            <li> Working so far, keeping my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as described....thank you!!</li>
            <li> Its the only thing that works to soften and condition my curly hair.  Not easily found in stores - so glad I could get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product and timely delivery</li>
            <li> If you have crazy, out of control hair this product is for you. Provides a nice level of moisture and controls flyaway strands while reducing the appearance of split ends. Also very economical compared to similar styling treatments as a small amount of product goes a long way. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love the Product. Been using it for 20 Years. If you have sensitive Hair this would work great for you.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair dresser. My hair is really dry from bleaching. This product is awesome for helping retain moisture and prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years. I love it.  In the store they only sell the 8 oz tube.  I use it a lot and have to buy it quite often.  It was a fast delivery too. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only thing that has helped reduce my static hair in the winter! Great</li>
            <li> This product was not made for some time. Once it has come back it does not seem to be the same. Sebastian Potion 9 never failed to keep all frizz away--I have a bad case of frizz. Now the product has not helped a bit. Have they changed their ingredients? I have put double the amount but it still doesn&#x27;t help at all. Next time I try it I will put about a half a cup into above shoulder length and see if that will work to eliminate frizz. :(</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite hair products. I have naturally wavy hair that is fine. I use this on my damp hair and let it air dry for a bit, a little heat with a diffuser, and I&#x27;m ready to go! It is flexible with good hold and control.</li>
            <li> Love potion 9! On set or wet hair it&#x27;s the beat leave in!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter-in-law and it works well on her thick hair.</li>
            <li> Use to use this 15 years ago.  Glad I remembered it,  tames my thick curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair used to be fried from bleaching it blonde repeatedly. After returning to my natural brown, cutting back on heat styling, and using this product, it&#x27;s hard to believe how my hair used to look compared to now. My hair dresser and I believe this product is a big reason my hair has been as to grow and look so beautiful. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of curl products. Ouidad did the job fairly well but it didn&#x27;t hold the curls for long.  I decided to try this based on the positive reviews. Hold my curls wells, feels soft to the touch, defines and keep it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking. Keeps the frizz down as well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my long curly hair and I always come back to this. I can&#x27;t get it in my local drugstore anymore, so I was happy to find it online in such a large bottle. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a present.  I sent it to Taiwan.  I don&#x27;t know the product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Potion 9 for years. I have course curly hair and it tames it wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I think this styling product is great I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and I have good wavy hair.  It&#x27;s down not up but I use just a little(too much makes it sticky)  and it keeps my hair in place better then other products.  It doesn&#x27;t curl it more or straighten it. I bought this as a replacement for water (my old styling product)  can tell it&#x27;s making a difference because for the past couple days people have been asking me if I was blowdrying it. I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair crunchy.  I don&#x27;t use much as my hair is shoulder length.  I use it while blow drying it and scrunch my hair.  I do get nice ringlets, but again, they are crunchy.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny, it just makes my hair stick together.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love what this does to my hair! By far the best product and price! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love it!! This stuff is the best!! Brought my hair back to life! I buy the biggest bottle because I know I&#x27;m gonna use every drop!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on time. Wasn&#x27;t shrink wrapped in plastic, but didn&#x27;t seem to cause a problem. Is a fantastic product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Hair Stylist recommended me to use this since i have the keratin treatment on my hair, and I love it!!! Fast shipping as well! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> love this stuff it is a must have for curly hair. I use this instead of mousse or gel on my natural curls and this also is a leave in treatment so it is much better for your hair than normal product. smells fabulous worth every penny just put on when your hair is wet and it makes your curls tame and gorgeous all day</li>
            <li> I always buy it. It is expensive but it worth it! You will not regret about buying this item, my hair is very dry and when I use it, it get much better</li>
            <li> great stuff.  Hard to find these days</li>
            <li> Great leave in, great for curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Potion 9 for years and found it to be the greatest product for putting into my curly hair and letting it air dry.  It keeps the curls in place and they feel soft.  Great product for letting naturally curly hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and in good order.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts is that I am not sure I have figured out how to use to product to maximize results.  But, that is my own issue, not the product.</li>
            <li> I’m using this for about 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a hair conditioner / restorer / fixer so easy to use and keeping the hair healthy</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for smooth silky hair. It has a wonderful scent and really makes my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It is quite possible I might shave my head if they ever discontinued this product. Ok, maybe I&#x27;d  be doomed to a life under a hat. Having curly hair can be really difficult to style and tame. I have been using this product in my hair daily for almost 20 years. It made me finally appreciate my curls. My girl friends hate me because it takes me mere moments to &amp;#34;do my hair.&amp;#34; I get out of the shower, finger a pump of potion 9 through my damp hair, scruch and go. I let it air dry for about an hour before giving it a quick scrunch to release a bit of the wet look and leave it be for the remainder of the day. This product is amazing! I hated the crispy, crunchy feel and look or flaky messes gels and mouses left. Serums, smoothers, and other curl taming products never worked right and my hair would look greasy or be a frizzy mess in no time. This actually works at holding nice curl shape and once dry and scrunched through it feels and looks like... my natural hair! Imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;I would always buy it from a local beauty supply store. Throughout the years the price kept creeping up. I finally decided I would not pay their ridiculous prices anymore and found it on Amazon for $10 cheaper. Sold! Arrived packaged well and intact within 2 days as promised with Prime. The pump bottle is perfect. If it came in a larger size, I would buy it. If you have curly hair, buy a trial size first and test it out. I would be shocked if you too didn&#x27;t fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product to begin with.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Potion 9 for years .... and I can&#x27;t live without it!  Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Came on time and it is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years on my curly and strong hair. Cannot live without it.  Leaves other products like Moroccan Oil in the dust.</li>
            <li> best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> My Daughter has tight curly hair.  She has been using this for about a year.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Like the product; good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great daily conditioner and styler for fine curly hair. Hop out the shower use a small pump, run it trough your fingers and go. Perfect hair after it dries and you run your fingers thru it. Silky, soft, smells yummy. #1 must have daily product.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair and i used this product for a couple weeks but not much changed. Although the smell is good.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for a girl with tangly hair. It detangles and softens the hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great for thick, coarse hair that has a tendency to have too much volume</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair with some control and lots of shine with only a small amount needed.  This is a salon size, but with the pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> excellent product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have used thus for over 15&#x27;years. I don&#x27;t use conditioners so this works as that and styling product. Smells so clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased fast response time</li>
            <li> Love it! I have use it everyday for more than 8 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!  I don&#x27;t care what they come out with next, will always continue to use!!</li>
            <li> Finding this product was like winning the lottery - it has completely changed how I manage my naturally curly and often out of control hair. A small dab of this, a small dab of a good gel and a diffuser - it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The product is not heavy or sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave any funny or flaky residue - I actually think it makes my coarse hair softer.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Great timing!! the product arrived in good conditions and exactly like I wanted to. Good efficient work that is the best way to shop.</li>
            <li> One of the best products u have used for curly hair!!! It is amazing against humidity!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smelling pretty good. It does not matter if you use it on wet or dry hair it does its job. After using Potion 9 on my hair, I use a little bit of Argan oil not on the roots though and my hair looks reaaally nice and healthy..</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I get so many complaints on how healthy and shiny my hair is. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
