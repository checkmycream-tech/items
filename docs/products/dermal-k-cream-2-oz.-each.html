    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is excellent for bruises!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better!!!</li>
            <li>This product worked great to shorten the duration of the bruise.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>worked good but irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I used on hydrated skin, and it feels great and the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I love Dermal K Cream.  </li>
            <li>Great to use on bruising - helps it heal twice as fast.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It worked better than Pro-K for me.</li>
            <li>So one more jar in the trash.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who bruises easily  *</li>
            <li>The Dixie Health Dermal-K Clarifying Cream works, and the 4 oz is the more economical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product - didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The nicest cool and calming skin cream.</li>
            <li>I read about Dermal-K in Lucky magazine.</li>
            <li>Areas with obvious sun-damage retain moisture better and are more plaiable</li>
            <li>The cosmetic results are far less important to me than the general health and enhanced healing-ability of my skin, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The entire transaction went very smoothly and on time.</li>
            <li>I am buying another large jar of this cream.</li>
            <li>The skin is healthier and more hydrated, the bruising is minimal, and healing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Drew Berrymore said it really helped with her spider veins.  </li>
            <li>Used up the whole jar according to instructions and did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li>I dont know what really works on spider veins but this did not work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The spider veins had been red, and now most of them are reduced to soft burgundy lines.</li>
            <li>However, I did have a series of bruises over that period of time (some pretty dark others just light brown).  </li>
            <li>I have always bruised easily, and this product gets rid of them in a few days, versus weeks (in some cases).  </li>
            <li>and it has completely reversed the problem on hands and lower arms.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when the 2 oz bottle arrived instead of the 4 oz.      </li>
            <li>Guess I will need to look much closer in the future</li>
            <li>Some sections of the veins have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>The thin, dry, sun-damaged skin on back of my hands has been become more fragile with age, and has a tendency to bruise and tear easily.</li>

            <li> Men are so visual, so the older women get less and less looked at and even when men are 90 they are still drooling at the 20 year olds and ignoring their companion of 60 or 70 years.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry damage skin from the sun.  </li>

            <li> May be it works for bruises, I can see that happening but its not strong enough for veins</li>
            <li> Pretty sad.</li>
            <li> The actual name for this is \\&quot;senile purpura\\&quot; and is common.</li>
            <li> You must use every day to see results for under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to help with bruising and age spots and skin tone, but after a month and a half it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> After using it for five weeks I saw no visible change or improvement in my spider veins (not even a slight reduction -- which I would have thought on some of the smaller faint lines --</li>
            <li> Surprise Surprise, we women get suckered into spending so much money for stopping/slowing down the \\&quot;aging\\&quot; process, wanting so badly for something to work!</li>
            <li> I purchased to treat my broken capillaries, or at least reduce the look of, but no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> But I have worse broken capillaries on my legs than I did when I started.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I noticed no difference whatsoever.  </li>

            <li> Did not live up to its advertised effect. It did nothing to remove spider veins.</li>
            <li> The entire transaction went very smoothly and on time. Product was properly packed and shipped, arriving on schedule. Doesn&#x27;t get any better!!!</li>
            <li> I love Dermal K Cream.  Use it daily.</li>
            <li> * Dermal K Cream eliminated my bruises in 2-3 days, I like the product  * Would recommend to anyone who bruises easily  * Comparable product is one called Bruise Relief</li>
            <li> I have very dry damage skin from the sun.  This cream has help my skin to recover some of its moisture it once once had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks after a rhinoplasty, not enough time to see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;I am not confortable using it since the jar doesn&#x27;t have expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have manufacture date either..no date at all..what gives me the feeling I&#x27;m using a doubtfull product.</li>
            <li> I read about Dermal-K in Lucky magazine. Drew Berrymore said it really helped with her spider veins.  So I decided to try it.  After using it for five weeks I saw no visible change or improvement in my spider veins (not even a slight reduction -- which I would have thought on some of the smaller faint lines -- but nope nothing). However, I did have a series of bruises over that period of time (some pretty dark others just light brown).  This product worked great to shorten the duration of the bruise.</li>
            <li> Great to use on bruising - helps it heal twice as fast.</li>
            <li> The thin, dry, sun-damaged skin on back of my hands has been become more fragile with age, and has a tendency to bruise and tear easily. The resulting damage has been taking longer to heal. The actual name for this is \\&quot;senile purpura\\&quot; and is common. Based on a couple other reviews by folks who were dealing with the same thing, I gave this product a try and it has completely reversed the problem on hands and lower arms. The skin is healthier and more hydrated, the bruising is minimal, and healing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it about 6 months and will continue to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on facial skin as well. Areas with obvious sun-damage retain moisture better and are more plaiable BUT it has not diminished rosacea-related surface blood vessel issues. The cosmetic results are far less important to me than the general health and enhanced healing-ability of my skin, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for bruises!</li>
            <li> When I ordered the Dixie Health Dermal-K Clarifying Cream, I expected the 4 oz size which I had ordered before.  The Dixie Health Dermal-K Clarifying Cream works, and the 4 oz is the more economical.  The description for   this item did not clearly state the size and in the description details, it states a shipping weight of 5 oz.    Product Details      * Shipping Weight: 5 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)      * ASIN: B000VAS2O0      * UPC: 704309140015      I was surprised when the 2 oz bottle arrived instead of the 4 oz.      Guess I will need to look much closer in the future because I do  not want to make a costly mistake again.</li>
            <li> I am buying another large jar of this cream. I applied it sparingly for a year about once a week after a shower to the spider veins on my legs. The spider veins had been red, and now most of them are reduced to soft burgundy lines. Some sections of the veins have completely disappeared. I am pleased with the results. It worked better than Pro-K for me.</li>
            <li> Used up the whole jar according to instructions and did not see any improvement. I used on hydrated skin, and it feels great and the smell is not unpleasant. It is a very nice moisturizer. I like the texture. But I have worse broken capillaries on my legs than I did when I started. I saw people say it works on bruises- and I can&#x27;t comment on that - but for me - on spider veins - it was not helpful at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product - didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin.  I purchased to treat my broken capillaries, or at least reduce the look of, but no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The nicest cool and calming skin cream. You must use every day to see results for under eye dark circles. Just leaves your face and throat feeling so refreshed.</li>
            <li> worked good but irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using  this cream for 8 weeks+ two times daily on moisturizized skin.  Does not work at all on even the smallest of spider veins.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I noticed no difference whatsoever.  Surprise Surprise, we women get suckered into spending so much money for stopping/slowing down the \\&quot;aging\\&quot; process, wanting so badly for something to work! It&#x27;s hard to physically age, especially for women.  Men are so visual, so the older women get less and less looked at and even when men are 90 they are still drooling at the 20 year olds and ignoring their companion of 60 or 70 years.  Pretty sad.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for spider veins on my legs, 3 weeks and no results. It just moisturizes. I dont know what really works on spider veins but this did not work. So one more jar in the trash. May be it works for bruises, I can see that happening but its not strong enough for veins</li>
            <li> I have always bruised easily, and this product gets rid of them in a few days, versus weeks (in some cases).  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot.  It is suppose to help with bruising and age spots and skin tone, but after a month and a half it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
