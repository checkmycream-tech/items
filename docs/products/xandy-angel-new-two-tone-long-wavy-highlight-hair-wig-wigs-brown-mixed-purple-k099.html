            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>This wig is good quality, gorgeous, and adjustable.</li>
            <li>It does not look good at all.</li>
            <li>a good wig.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Which is surprising because I thought it was suppose to be brown and purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it...</li>
            <li>The wig itself is lovely, the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>Held up real nice easy to style..</li>
            <li>the wig itself is exceptionally well made.</li>
            <li>This wig is gorgeous, even better in person!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great length and looks a lot better with a hat, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and that doesn&#x27;t really fit me, but I was able to move it around and it fits great!</li>
            <li>I will defiantly be purchasing more of their wigs!</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li>, the quality of the hair is great and it was SO FULL!</li>
            <li>Looks great easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Nice and full, lovely curls, and it&#x27;s just beautiful!!</li>
            <li>everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair and was asking me about my stylist&#x27;s name!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have a large head, and it fits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This unit is not heat safe, but it&#x27;s very full and the color is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This wig is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing</li>
            <li>thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li>Nice quality</li>
            <li>I own</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, long wig, brushes out wonderfully.</li>
            <li>If you wear a hat with this wig it looks nice</li>
            <li>I am buying 3 more to give to my girlfriends who loved</li>
            <li>The product I received appears somewhat lighter than depicted, but that was a nice suprise.</li>
            <li>Full and great color :</li>
            <li>Fun and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and matte like natural hair, and the gradient coloring is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I like the color, however the top of the wig is very bulky and unnatural so its best worn with a hat.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s A LOT of hair, and it&#x27;s very nice and full.</li>
            <li>Just put it on and very easy to shed.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something fun to wear out on girls night, or just to change up your look this wig is great for that.  </li>
            <li>about 100 wigs n payed a lot of money for them , this wig here is a most have to was nice n</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use this for halloween and want a budget wig for a costume this may be suitable.</li>
            <li>3&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>but so far still love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely wig for a great price, the colors are cute and the curls and fullness are just right.</li>
            <li>Very important.</li>
            <li>I selected this very light one with the lavender ends.</li>
            <li>It worked better with a clip, but would also be cute with a scarf or headband.  </li>
            <li>Better for a costume look than every day wear.</li>
            <li>and I also love the chance this gives me to change my hair color.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say \\&quot;GO FOR IT!!!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>My purchase was not as satisfying.</li>
            <li>I wore it out and a girl said that I had the most prettiest hair she had ever seen and wanted to know who my stylist was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, though, I LOVE this wig.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>You can also report the front or move the bangs around to better suit your style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love...</li>
            <li>l was more surprise</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I like these colors much better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is my first wig, but I can say that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be ordering more wigs from X&amp;YAngel soon.</li>
            <li>so cute and well done.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of the zig-zag part</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several wigs from this seller and they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>This WIG IS SO CUTE...........................................................</li>
            <li>Just love this wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is okay...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li>I love X&amp;Y hair.</li>
            <li>I feel cheated!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is absolutely stunning in person.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>love ittt~</li>
            <li>LOVE this wig.</li>
            <li>So cheap!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am impressed and quite pleased about the purchase of this unit.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more wigs from them :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>The curls are so springy and adorable.</li>
            <li>it looks much better with a hat on</li>
            <li>colour is a bit more violet than shown.</li>
            <li>Not that I don&#x27;t love this wig, but it can get tangly and when brushing it whit a wig brush</li>
            <li>Of course I buy mostly $7-$10 wigs, but this was a $10 wig</li>
            <li>so I could add a more &amp;#34;Natural beach curl&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But It works, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>so cute, beautiful colour, and very soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and full, and I love the part;</li>
            <li>it was packaged pretty good.</li>
            <li>-is how easy it is to have the top show through the hair.</li>
            <li>the seller is super kind, I had some issues with it getting to me</li>
            <li>and I am able to fit all of my hair in the cap.</li>
            <li>Cute color and length, but the hair is very obviously cheap and synthetic.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great and the hair is so soft</li>
            <li>and I think the first order got lost, they were totally nice and kept in contact with me to make sure that I was satified.</li>
            <li>I loved how this wig looked straight out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li>I DO like this wig, super soft, curls are beautiful but am on the fence about keeping or returning.</li>
            <li>It fits great, and though I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, it is perfect for a fun night out or a baseball game with my husband.</li>
            <li>had some faults, but pretty amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but also could be a smidge better.</li>
            <li>Had to play around with the way it is sectioned in front, made a waterfall braid in front going down the side and its AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;brown\\&quot; part of it makes it look almost a greyish color at the top since it&#x27;s blended with the lilac, but it looks interesting and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>Ordered this wig because it looked super cute.</li>
            <li>But I got lucky!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the cute wig!</li>
            <li>A light brown shouldn&#x27;t have a pinky tint to it.</li>
            <li>It is not crazy shiny like most synthetic hair in this price range either.</li>
            <li>fit was good, colours were okay, but I ordered two for an event, and they were two completely different wigs.</li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>however, for what it is, its fantastic.</li>
            <li>still, its fun and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I took several crappy pictures lol just on how I styled it</li>
            <li>If this is a good example of this company&#x27;s wigs I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so pretty!!</li>
            <li>full so real and will made love it love it</li>
            <li>Much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and high quality than most wigs at this price range.</li>
            <li>Tanhlrs easily, but very pretty.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be a cute mock wig for Halloween, and being a seasoned wig buyer</li>
            <li>Shipping can take some time coming from asia, but it is so worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I bought it</li>
            <li>grey and purple, blended very nicely together.</li>
            <li>So naturally I was even more excited that I ordered it!</li>
            <li>Super fun, easy to wear.</li>
            <li>This wig is cheap and as such I expected it might not be great, but I&#x27;ve actually been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a beautiful wig l just got it was very surprise when l receive because it only took like 2 weeks to get here</li>
            <li>The colors are adorable, but I wish it was straight</li>
            <li>the part on top is zigzag, so it won&#x27;t part straight.</li>
            <li>The wig I received does not appear as full as depicted, but the webbing does not peep through.</li>
            <li>This is clearly my favourite wig I own.</li>
            <li>Front pieces tend to fall in your face, top is very bulky and looks super unnatural.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got such an incredible good quality real looking long lasting wig for so cheap of a price!!</li>
            <li>Ok if you are looking for a realistic looking wig this is not the wig for you.</li>
            <li>The brown is more of an ash blonde then brown which I like better.</li>
            <li>the crown doesn&#x27;t show any netting, and it came SUPER curly...</li>
            <li>and I love it; the color I got is more of a greyish blonde than ash brown in the picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and doesn&#x27;t shed a lot.</li>
            <li>Its my first one!</li>
            <li>I got this exact wig from a seller on etsy for $117 and wish I had spotted this sooner!</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, it&#x27;s not a bad wig, and I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed with my purchase, but I really wish the colours were truer to the advertisement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and the hair feels like it could pass for real.</li>
            <li>My favorite wig so far</li>
            <li>I had to fiddle around with the placement of it on my head to make it look more natural and bobby-pinned one of the sides</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a more natural hairline</li>
            <li>I got it earlier then expected which was awesome</li>
            <li>A FUN WIG</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get here, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But it still looks good, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>shipping super fast!</li>
            <li>so i dont really wear it out unless its like a party or for cosplay, all in all its ok, sheds alot, main problem is the cap that showes underneath</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>so I cant work with it :), its long and fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>but I get lazy lol.</li>
            <li>Fun wig pretty colors...</li>
            <li>Such a great wig, totally beat my expectation!!</li>
            <li>I mean, I have never seen a good, cheap wig.</li>
            <li>curls are very defined an very pretty.</li>
            <li>When it came it was very VERY curly.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t exactly like picture.</li>
            <li>The blondeish top color is SEVERAL shades darker than pictured.</li>
            <li>Very impressive for such a small price.  </li>
            <li>The brown part is darker than shown in the top imagine (where the model&#x27;s back facing the camera).</li>
            <li>It came lightining fast!</li>
            <li>the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Quality was much higher than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I posted images and I have several more posted here:</li>
            <li>Just like the picture, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Wig is pretty blond, not as ashy as in the picture.</li>
            <li>it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>My first wig ever</li>
            <li>Cute wig, definitely get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>SO BEAUTIFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig is EXACTLY like picture.</li>
            <li>the color is more of a deep auburn and lilac&lt;</li>
            <li>It is very soft and full, and a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>Nice wig, but there is an area on the right side where you can see the black undercap showing through.</li>
            <li>It has a zig zag part at the top, which I think makes it look a little bit more natural.</li>
            <li>The top is rather strange.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and the color is true to the photo.</li>
            <li>Super soft and</li>
            <li>wig is super soft and not shiny.</li>
            <li>super soft, no wig shine, looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cut a few inches off the bottom and it looks much more full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color and would make a GREAT everyday wig if I can figure out how to fix the showing wefts.</li>
            <li>The coloring is less brown and more blonde, and the curls are just lovely.</li>
            <li>Super pretty and looks incredibly real! will definitely buy from seller again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is Phi Phi O&#x27;hara from the hit TV show &amp;#34;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race!&amp;#34; I ordered this wig because I am in love with these colors and said what the heck give it a try and see how it looks.</li>
            <li>Looks so real.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much of an effect. &#x27;</li>
            <li>My wig turned out to be a light blonde that fades into a lavender.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this wig.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now my mother even wants one too...</li>
            <li>so real n</li>
            <li>VERY WELL MADE AND</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this wig</li>
            <li>It came very curly, amost shirley temple curls</li>
            <li>I also bought a straight wig from these guys.</li>
            <li>I wore it ever day for almost two weeks straight, hair sprayed it, threw it on the floor at night, fell asleep on the couch in it once,</li>
            <li>and I could still brush it straight.</li>
            <li>wig is  very well done .............</li>
            <li>I really wish there was a 2.5 stars.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much^.^</li>
            <li>but I made mine a bit more of a side part instead of a center part with a bit of hair spray and a pin.</li>
            <li>The wig I received appears light-medium champagne blonde than light brown.</li>
            <li>Also, it is much curlier than the picture.</li>
            <li>one was extremely curly and light, the other was wavy at best and dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, and I can&#x27;t get over how gorgeous the curls are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in style and looks totally unique and different.  </li>
            <li>the purple vibrant but stood out way to much</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair, the coloration is subtle, it&#x27;s comfortable, and easily styled.  </li>
            <li>As long as  I wear a hat over it though, it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>and then when I actually held the product the colors were true to this picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented about my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;(wig) before when i wear it out, and looks realistic.</li>
            <li>Instead, it&#x27;s thick, full, natural looking, and fully able to stand up to day to day wear.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY</li>
            <li>The wig feels high quality and stable.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I wore this wig for the first time,  I tied a small colorful groovy scarf around the crown, and I received several compliments  and rubber necking while driving. :-)  </li>
            <li>I actually intend to dye my hair exactly like this wig!</li>
            <li>Expected quality for a cheap wig&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I fully expected a cheap costume wig that was shiny and flimsy.</li>
            <li>It was very flowy and soft.</li>
            <li>Seriously I&#x27;d be like 12 more just to have them!</li>
            <li>Mine came in as a blonde color with lilac tones, not bad really except my hair is blonde</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a wonderfully fantastic wig for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Color is true to picture, is soft and long, will not re-curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long, soft, and full.</li>
            <li>The wig sheds pretty easily, and because of the thick crown area I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, not big on the top like the other reviews say.</li>
            <li>on the other side, the brown is way more blonde</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty wig</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The purple is pretty close to what&#x27;s pictured, but the blonde is...overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now gotten thin at the top because of brushing, but I still wear the sucker, but up in a pony tail with it styled so it looks great still with a white head band on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle much and it&#x27;s so pretty, maybe a little less purple and more pinky</li>
            <li>I wear it with a beanie or a hat usually, just so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The curls were Very soft and bouncy, and with some work the wig could look completely</li>
            <li>It came nearly 31/2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a blonde with little hints of purple.</li>
            <li>you could clearly see the cap.</li>
            <li>The hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>but the purple wasn&#x27;t as pronounced as it was in the image, but not really enough to really complain about it.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>also got here really early.</li>
            <li>Its beatiful and soft.</li>
            <li>To remedy this, I plan to add netting around the edges and add clips in order to completely cover my hairline for wind factor purposes.  </li>
            <li>and it came almost two weeks early; received it today C:</li>
            <li>The picture depicts beach waves, but the actual wig is very curly.</li>
            <li>Straight up, out of the bottle blonde.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is that part of the lining actually shows at the hairline right where the part is.  </li>
            <li>It shed very little and untangles easily with a wide-tooth comb.</li>
            <li>They will get a little stringy, so bring that comb with you and, just like long hair in general, pass the comb through a few times throughout the day to retain that beautiful soft curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks super-small, but I&#x27;ve got a fat German head and really long hair, and I got it to fit relatively painlessly.</li>
            <li>No netting shows through anywhere,  in fact its almost too thick for my small head (I buy childrens hats because they fit better).</li>
            <li>I worn this wig for a week straight and it hardly tangled or shed I just combed it gently and applied a little hairspray to a few fly aways.</li>
            <li>and it was a little difficult to fit, but once I got it, it looked so cute!</li>
            <li>I normally wear my hair dark with big chunks of cherry red highlights but thought this would be fun and spice things up a bit but does fit a bit odd and the colors are a bit off from the pictures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a blend of light brown, pale pink, and purple/lavender, very feminine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap and fun wig if you&#x27;re silly like me and just want to have wigs around.</li>
            <li>I just mean fitting and such.)</li>
            <li>I kinda like all the stupefied looks I get from people (currently living in a town of old people, lot of staring),</li>
            <li>This wig, however, isn&#x27;t even worth it for cosplay let alone everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and thick, and the curls keep their shape.  </li>
            <li>in all I would buy it again, the only down side is it takes a while to find the right seem to hide the wig cap at.</li>
            <li>I thought the cap would be too small and the curls would come out to quickly.</li>
            <li>This wig has such phenomenal coloring, and it is incredibly soft, I was shocked to find that it rarely tangles.</li>
            <li>Like other reviews have said, the parting in the top is a little strange - could probably be fixed to personal taste, but I&#x27;ll probably just wear a hat with it.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package the color threw me off and was a little displeasing.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig with the mind set that it wasnt gonna be all that, that it would tangle easy, be really thin, barely have curls...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig is very thin, which looks natural at the bottom, but the wefts show at the top.</li>
            <li>It was ok, wig cap shows threw and gets tangled like crazy, sadly it doesnt look good on me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full and thick.</li>
            <li>it does tangle easily and has a weird part, so i have to knock off one star, but this can just be fixed with a flower crown or a hat.</li>

            <li> This wig is good quality, gorgeous, and adjustable.</li>
            <li> It does not look good at all.</li>
            <li> a good wig.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it...</li>
            <li> The wig itself is lovely, the colors are beautiful.</li>

            <li> the wig itself is exceptionally well made.</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous, even better in person!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great length and looks a lot better with a hat, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and that doesn&#x27;t really fit me, but I was able to move it around and it fits great!</li>
            <li> I will defiantly be purchasing more of their wigs!</li>

            <li> Nice and full, lovely curls, and it&#x27;s just beautiful!!</li>
            <li> everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair and was asking me about my stylist&#x27;s name!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a large head, and it fits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This unit is not heat safe, but it&#x27;s very full and the color is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This wig is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing</li>
            <li> thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> Nice quality</li>
            <li> I own</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, long wig, brushes out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> If you wear a hat with this wig it looks nice</li>
            <li> I am buying 3 more to give to my girlfriends who loved</li>
            <li> The product I received appears somewhat lighter than depicted, but that was a nice suprise.</li>
            <li> Full and great color :</li>
            <li> Fun and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and matte like natural hair, and the gradient coloring is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I like the color, however the top of the wig is very bulky and unnatural so its best worn with a hat.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s A LOT of hair, and it&#x27;s very nice and full.</li>
            <li> Just put it on and very easy to shed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something fun to wear out on girls night, or just to change up your look this wig is great for that.  </li>
            <li> about 100 wigs n payed a lot of money for them , this wig here is a most have to was nice n</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use this for halloween and want a budget wig for a costume this may be suitable.</li>
            <li> 3&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> but so far still love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig for a great price, the colors are cute and the curls and fullness are just right.</li>
            <li> Very important.</li>
            <li> I selected this very light one with the lavender ends.</li>
            <li> It worked better with a clip, but would also be cute with a scarf or headband.  </li>
            <li> Better for a costume look than every day wear.</li>
            <li> and I also love the chance this gives me to change my hair color.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say \\&quot;GO FOR IT!!!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> My purchase was not as satisfying.</li>
            <li> I wore it out and a girl said that I had the most prettiest hair she had ever seen and wanted to know who my stylist was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, though, I LOVE this wig.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> You can also report the front or move the bangs around to better suit your style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love...</li>
            <li> l was more surprise</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I like these colors much better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This is my first wig, but I can say that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be ordering more wigs from X&amp;YAngel soon.</li>
            <li> so cute and well done.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the zig-zag part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several wigs from this seller and they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> This WIG IS SO CUTE...........................................................</li>
            <li> Just love this wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is okay...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li> I love X&amp;Y hair.</li>
            <li> I feel cheated!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely stunning in person.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> love ittt~</li>
            <li> LOVE this wig.</li>
            <li> So cheap!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am impressed and quite pleased about the purchase of this unit.</li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more wigs from them :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li> The curls are so springy and adorable.</li>
            <li> it looks much better with a hat on</li>
            <li> colour is a bit more violet than shown.</li>
            <li> Not that I don&#x27;t love this wig, but it can get tangly and when brushing it whit a wig brush</li>
            <li> Of course I buy mostly $7-$10 wigs, but this was a $10 wig</li>
            <li> so I could add a more &amp;#34;Natural beach curl&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But It works, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> so cute, beautiful colour, and very soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice and full, and I love the part;</li>
            <li> it was packaged pretty good.</li>
            <li> -is how easy it is to have the top show through the hair.</li>
            <li> the seller is super kind, I had some issues with it getting to me</li>
            <li> and I am able to fit all of my hair in the cap.</li>
            <li> Cute color and length, but the hair is very obviously cheap and synthetic.  </li>
            <li> The colors are great and the hair is so soft</li>
            <li> and I think the first order got lost, they were totally nice and kept in contact with me to make sure that I was satified.</li>
            <li> I loved how this wig looked straight out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> I DO like this wig, super soft, curls are beautiful but am on the fence about keeping or returning.</li>
            <li> It fits great, and though I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, it is perfect for a fun night out or a baseball game with my husband.</li>
            <li> had some faults, but pretty amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but also could be a smidge better.</li>
            <li> Had to play around with the way it is sectioned in front, made a waterfall braid in front going down the side and its AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;brown\\&quot; part of it makes it look almost a greyish color at the top since it&#x27;s blended with the lilac, but it looks interesting and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> Ordered this wig because it looked super cute.</li>
            <li> But I got lucky!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the cute wig!</li>
            <li> A light brown shouldn&#x27;t have a pinky tint to it.</li>
            <li> It is not crazy shiny like most synthetic hair in this price range either.</li>
            <li> fit was good, colours were okay, but I ordered two for an event, and they were two completely different wigs.</li>
            <li> its cheap</li>
            <li> however, for what it is, its fantastic.</li>
            <li> still, its fun and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I took several crappy pictures lol just on how I styled it</li>
            <li> If this is a good example of this company&#x27;s wigs I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so pretty!!</li>
            <li> full so real and will made love it love it</li>
            <li> Much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and high quality than most wigs at this price range.</li>
            <li> Tanhlrs easily, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be a cute mock wig for Halloween, and being a seasoned wig buyer</li>
            <li> Shipping can take some time coming from asia, but it is so worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I bought it</li>
            <li> grey and purple, blended very nicely together.</li>
            <li> So naturally I was even more excited that I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Super fun, easy to wear.</li>
            <li> This wig is cheap and as such I expected it might not be great, but I&#x27;ve actually been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a beautiful wig l just got it was very surprise when l receive because it only took like 2 weeks to get here</li>
            <li> The colors are adorable, but I wish it was straight</li>
            <li> the part on top is zigzag, so it won&#x27;t part straight.</li>
            <li> The wig I received does not appear as full as depicted, but the webbing does not peep through.</li>
            <li> This is clearly my favourite wig I own.</li>
            <li> Front pieces tend to fall in your face, top is very bulky and looks super unnatural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got such an incredible good quality real looking long lasting wig for so cheap of a price!!</li>
            <li> Ok if you are looking for a realistic looking wig this is not the wig for you.</li>
            <li> The brown is more of an ash blonde then brown which I like better.</li>
            <li> the crown doesn&#x27;t show any netting, and it came SUPER curly...</li>
            <li> and I love it; the color I got is more of a greyish blonde than ash brown in the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and doesn&#x27;t shed a lot.</li>
            <li> Its my first one!</li>
            <li> I got this exact wig from a seller on etsy for $117 and wish I had spotted this sooner!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it&#x27;s not a bad wig, and I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed with my purchase, but I really wish the colours were truer to the advertisement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and the hair feels like it could pass for real.</li>
            <li> My favorite wig so far</li>
            <li> I had to fiddle around with the placement of it on my head to make it look more natural and bobby-pinned one of the sides</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a more natural hairline</li>
            <li> I got it earlier then expected which was awesome</li>
            <li> A FUN WIG</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get here, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But it still looks good, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> shipping super fast!</li>
            <li> so i dont really wear it out unless its like a party or for cosplay, all in all its ok, sheds alot, main problem is the cap that showes underneath</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> so I cant work with it :), its long and fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> but I get lazy lol.</li>
            <li> Fun wig pretty colors...</li>
            <li> Such a great wig, totally beat my expectation!!</li>
            <li> I mean, I have never seen a good, cheap wig.</li>
            <li> curls are very defined an very pretty.</li>
            <li> When it came it was very VERY curly.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t exactly like picture.</li>
            <li> The blondeish top color is SEVERAL shades darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> Very impressive for such a small price.  </li>
            <li> The brown part is darker than shown in the top imagine (where the model&#x27;s back facing the camera).</li>
            <li> It came lightining fast!</li>
            <li> the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Quality was much higher than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I posted images and I have several more posted here:</li>
            <li> Just like the picture, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Wig is pretty blond, not as ashy as in the picture.</li>
            <li> it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> My first wig ever</li>
            <li> Cute wig, definitely get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> SO BEAUTIFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig is EXACTLY like picture.</li>
            <li> the color is more of a deep auburn and lilac&lt;</li>
            <li> It is very soft and full, and a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> Nice wig, but there is an area on the right side where you can see the black undercap showing through.</li>
            <li> It has a zig zag part at the top, which I think makes it look a little bit more natural.</li>
            <li> The top is rather strange.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and the color is true to the photo.</li>
            <li> Super soft and</li>
            <li> wig is super soft and not shiny.</li>
            <li> super soft, no wig shine, looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cut a few inches off the bottom and it looks much more full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a pretty color and would make a GREAT everyday wig if I can figure out how to fix the showing wefts.</li>
            <li> The coloring is less brown and more blonde, and the curls are just lovely.</li>
            <li> Super pretty and looks incredibly real! will definitely buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is Phi Phi O&#x27;hara from the hit TV show &amp;#34;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race!&amp;#34; I ordered this wig because I am in love with these colors and said what the heck give it a try and see how it looks.</li>
            <li> Looks so real.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much of an effect. &#x27;</li>
            <li> My wig turned out to be a light blonde that fades into a lavender.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this wig.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now my mother even wants one too...</li>
            <li> so real n</li>
            <li> VERY WELL MADE AND</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this wig</li>
            <li> It came very curly, amost shirley temple curls</li>
            <li> I also bought a straight wig from these guys.</li>
            <li> I wore it ever day for almost two weeks straight, hair sprayed it, threw it on the floor at night, fell asleep on the couch in it once,</li>
            <li> and I could still brush it straight.</li>
            <li> wig is  very well done .............</li>
            <li> I really wish there was a 2.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much^.^</li>
            <li> but I made mine a bit more of a side part instead of a center part with a bit of hair spray and a pin.</li>
            <li> The wig I received appears light-medium champagne blonde than light brown.</li>
            <li> Also, it is much curlier than the picture.</li>
            <li> one was extremely curly and light, the other was wavy at best and dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and I can&#x27;t get over how gorgeous the curls are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in style and looks totally unique and different.  </li>
            <li> the purple vibrant but stood out way to much</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair, the coloration is subtle, it&#x27;s comfortable, and easily styled.  </li>
            <li> As long as  I wear a hat over it though, it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> and then when I actually held the product the colors were true to this picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented about my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;(wig) before when i wear it out, and looks realistic.</li>
            <li> Instead, it&#x27;s thick, full, natural looking, and fully able to stand up to day to day wear.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY</li>
            <li> The wig feels high quality and stable.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I wore this wig for the first time,  I tied a small colorful groovy scarf around the crown, and I received several compliments  and rubber necking while driving. :-)  </li>
            <li> I actually intend to dye my hair exactly like this wig!</li>
            <li> Expected quality for a cheap wig&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I fully expected a cheap costume wig that was shiny and flimsy.</li>
            <li> It was very flowy and soft.</li>
            <li> Seriously I&#x27;d be like 12 more just to have them!</li>
            <li> Mine came in as a blonde color with lilac tones, not bad really except my hair is blonde</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wonderfully fantastic wig for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Color is true to picture, is soft and long, will not re-curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long, soft, and full.</li>
            <li> The wig sheds pretty easily, and because of the thick crown area I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, not big on the top like the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> on the other side, the brown is way more blonde</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty wig</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The purple is pretty close to what&#x27;s pictured, but the blonde is...overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now gotten thin at the top because of brushing, but I still wear the sucker, but up in a pony tail with it styled so it looks great still with a white head band on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle much and it&#x27;s so pretty, maybe a little less purple and more pinky</li>
            <li> I wear it with a beanie or a hat usually, just so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> The curls were Very soft and bouncy, and with some work the wig could look completely</li>
            <li> It came nearly 31/2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a blonde with little hints of purple.</li>
            <li> you could clearly see the cap.</li>
            <li> The hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> but the purple wasn&#x27;t as pronounced as it was in the image, but not really enough to really complain about it.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> also got here really early.</li>
            <li> Its beatiful and soft.</li>
            <li> To remedy this, I plan to add netting around the edges and add clips in order to completely cover my hairline for wind factor purposes.  </li>
            <li> and it came almost two weeks early; received it today C:</li>
            <li> The picture depicts beach waves, but the actual wig is very curly.</li>
            <li> Straight up, out of the bottle blonde.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that part of the lining actually shows at the hairline right where the part is.  </li>
            <li> It shed very little and untangles easily with a wide-tooth comb.</li>
            <li> They will get a little stringy, so bring that comb with you and, just like long hair in general, pass the comb through a few times throughout the day to retain that beautiful soft curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks super-small, but I&#x27;ve got a fat German head and really long hair, and I got it to fit relatively painlessly.</li>
            <li> No netting shows through anywhere,  in fact its almost too thick for my small head (I buy childrens hats because they fit better).</li>
            <li> I worn this wig for a week straight and it hardly tangled or shed I just combed it gently and applied a little hairspray to a few fly aways.</li>
            <li> and it was a little difficult to fit, but once I got it, it looked so cute!</li>
            <li> I normally wear my hair dark with big chunks of cherry red highlights but thought this would be fun and spice things up a bit but does fit a bit odd and the colors are a bit off from the pictures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blend of light brown, pale pink, and purple/lavender, very feminine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and fun wig if you&#x27;re silly like me and just want to have wigs around.</li>
            <li> I just mean fitting and such.)</li>
            <li> I kinda like all the stupefied looks I get from people (currently living in a town of old people, lot of staring),</li>
            <li> This wig, however, isn&#x27;t even worth it for cosplay let alone everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and thick, and the curls keep their shape.  </li>
            <li> in all I would buy it again, the only down side is it takes a while to find the right seem to hide the wig cap at.</li>
            <li> I thought the cap would be too small and the curls would come out to quickly.</li>
            <li> This wig has such phenomenal coloring, and it is incredibly soft, I was shocked to find that it rarely tangles.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, the parting in the top is a little strange - could probably be fixed to personal taste, but I&#x27;ll probably just wear a hat with it.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package the color threw me off and was a little displeasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig with the mind set that it wasnt gonna be all that, that it would tangle easy, be really thin, barely have curls...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig is very thin, which looks natural at the bottom, but the wefts show at the top.</li>
            <li> It was ok, wig cap shows threw and gets tangled like crazy, sadly it doesnt look good on me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full and thick.</li>
            <li> it does tangle easily and has a weird part, so i have to knock off one star, but this can just be fixed with a flower crown or a hat.</li>
            <li> :) The part is a little wonky, but ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; a fascinator or hat or flower crown can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> little thin (to be expected of a cheap wig)&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a little (to be expected of a cheap wig; I brushed it out with a wig brush before wearing, which reduced the shedding)&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to part</li>
            <li> but mine is blonde not brown like the picture or grey like some reviews but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid more for other synthetic wigs of supposed &#x27;better quality&#x27; that either shed horribly, or become matted after wearing once.  </li>
            <li> it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to wearing a wig is to line it up with your natural hairline, get rid of the real shiny fake look by using hairspray, and to cut a few wispy stray hairs around the face area to replicate a real hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like the only way to fix it would be to take small scissors and trim that part very carefully, although I haven&#x27;t attempted it yet because I don&#x27;t want to ruin the wig, but I also don&#x27;t really want to wear it around with the lining showing.  </li>
            <li> and i mean ive gotten a lot of compliments saying it looks expensive and very realistic and not even like a wig however since its far from my first wig</li>
            <li> With minor adjustments at my end (i.e., makeup and etc.)</li>
            <li> The color looks fine in the long run, and even though it&#x27;s a little on the thin side it covers everything</li>
            <li> After purchasing from other sellers, I only buy from these guys.</li>
            <li> but I cut it and used dry shampoo to try and remove the shine.  </li>
            <li> I found there was too much hair at the front of the wig and ended up cutting bangs into it, which really isn&#x27;t a downside, just something for you to note when purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Thin in the back and the bangs have way too much hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the outdated zig-zag part, that can be easily changed if you have some wig knowledge.  </li>
            <li> cons: arrived late, shipped to wrong address, has bangs, purple color is only at bottom inch of hair, only had a couple waves, tangles easy.</li>
            <li> part down the middle.</li>
            <li> The wig is not nearly as long as it shows in the pictures not to mention that there is so little hair in the wig you can see the netting without even looking closely.</li>
            <li> I naturally have thick curly hair that is fairly long</li>
            <li> Shiny like natural hair and not that weird thick plastic feeling of other cheap wigs.</li>
            <li> My wig is a little different in color then the picture.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also only a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a defect with this one wig, or a general defect in the line.</li>
            <li> so it was expected.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Needed minimal styling.</li>
            <li> Instead of brunette and pink</li>
            <li> : I felt it slipping off my head while taking the photo</li>
            <li> I guess I should not expect much for $14, but this was even worse than expected.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is that the hair cap is black, wish it was brown like the hair.</li>
            <li> The donwside to it is that mine came with some weird kinks at the top that look pretty ugly</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it and</li>
            <li> I have three other wigs, one of which was purchased from Amazon and without problems.</li>
            <li> sit properly due to the way the wig is constructed.</li>
            <li> Based on other purchaser&#x27;s uploaded pics the tones, shades, hues, and color blends seem to vary.  </li>
            <li> the cap is too small for someone with either a big head or thicker hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kinda expected it to be a little darker</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair the cap is too small to hold all if your hair and these are non returnable.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about drastic change from my Winter style  (dark roots &amp; berry).  </li>
            <li> Because I love the colors and length, but I hate how I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; the part to switch the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; to.</li>
            <li> My one complaint-knocking it down a star</li>
            <li> The cap does not have sideburn flaps like some of my other wigs, so I have to wear the hair down and my styling options are a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will hold up, but we&#x27;ll see I guess!</li>
            <li> As I suspected, the colors were slightly off.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle ombre effect but the front of the wig is a crooked mess.  </li>
            <li> Wig is not true to color in picture</li>
            <li> zag starts shows a little bit of the tracks.</li>
            <li> the front part is a bit off, but you can always wear a hat, or try to move the parting a little bit.</li>
            <li> First off I received this faster than any of the other packages I have ordered which shocked me</li>
            <li> Not a very believable part, on me.</li>
            <li> So a few days ago, I saw that Phi Phi O&#x27;Hara bought and reviewed this wig.</li>
            <li> The curls are nice and bouncy and the wig fibers are just insanely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it out a few times now and the curl is sti holding.</li>
            <li> I wore it to the point I was wearing it out everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not really happy considering how long I waited for this to be delviered.</li>
            <li> The cap is also REALLY small.</li>
            <li> You usually get what you pay for when it comes to wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have to wear it with a hat.</li>
            <li> The wig netting seems tailored for small head sizes.</li>
            <li> as per usual when shifting seasons, this wig for a Spring-Summer switch up.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because it parts in the middle</li>
            <li> It was a little long for my taste, so I ended up cutting some off&lt;br /&gt;D)</li>
            <li> About an hour of passing around and wearing at our game night (we&#x27;re just that odd)</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s dumb and a waste of time and money,</li>
            <li> and theres hardly any purple on the ends</li>
            <li> There is no shedding to speak of, unless I brush it too hard.</li>
            <li> By wonky, I mean it looks wig-ish.</li>
            <li> I mean it wasn&#x27;t even close to the color in the pictures shown...</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this wig in general.</li>
            <li> thin to be functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m not too crazy over it</li>
            <li> Not shiny and fake looking like a lot of wigs.</li>
            <li> It looks really fake, it&#x27;s way too shiny, and the colors weren&#x27;t the ones they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li> but so do my expensive extensions as well...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Look too shiny, and fake</li>
            <li> Wig photographs so fake looking as well.</li>
            <li> But ill wear a hat with it of course</li>
            <li> (sort of like how hair dries in weird ways after you take a shower and fall asleep on it) and because the wig isn&#x27;t  heat resistant (it will melt, don&#x27;t try it)</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t order wrong.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot but sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> When I let her in on my secret she couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li> The wig is shiny and looks very fake.</li>
            <li> but either I got a bad one</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with what I received.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> Packaging was horrible, it came in a baggie inside a baggie.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  </li>

            <li> The color is not the same as the picture.  A light brown shouldn&#x27;t have a pinky tint to it.</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is amazing! Not shiny and fake looking like a lot of wigs. I also haven&#x27;t had any shedding! I naturally have thick curly hair that is fairly long and I am able to fit all of my hair in the cap. I will defiantly be purchasing more of their wigs!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. This wig is cheap and as such I expected it might not be great, but I&#x27;ve actually been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great colors and length&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily&lt;br /&gt;Got lots of compliments&lt;br /&gt;Looks as pictured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;A little thin (to be expected of a cheap wig)&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a little (to be expected of a cheap wig; I brushed it out with a wig brush before wearing, which reduced the shedding)&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to part</li>
            <li> So in love its perfect</li>
            <li> Excellent wig! Full and great color :3&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t exactly like picture.</li>
            <li> Thin in the back and the bangs have way too much hair. The wig is shiny and looks very fake. It can be used for cosplay or anything of the sort.</li>
            <li> I love this piece! It is very soft and full, and a really pretty color. It fits great, and though I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, it is perfect for a fun night out or a baseball game with my husband. I have a large head, and it fits me perfectly.  I like that it has no bangs. I can work my front hair into it. It is not crazy shiny like most synthetic hair in this price range either. A great price for a really beautiful piece....</li>
            <li> Was a beautiful wig, and really REALLY good price. No complaints, only complements.</li>
            <li> The blondeish top color is SEVERAL shades darker than pictured. Not really happy considering how long I waited for this to be delviered.</li>
            <li> Very impressive for such a small price.  My only complaint is the outdated zig-zag part, that can be easily changed if you have some wig knowledge.  This unit is not heat safe, but it&#x27;s very full and the color is beautiful.  One of my hairdressing clients ordered the same wig for a fairy costume after seeing this in person.</li>
            <li> The brown part is darker than shown in the top imagine (where the model&#x27;s back facing the camera). Color is closest to the third image.&lt;br /&gt;The curls looks just as pictured.</li>
            <li> My favorite wig so far</li>
            <li> Ok if you are looking for a realistic looking wig this is not the wig for you. If you are looking for something fun to wear out on girls night, or just to change up your look this wig is great for that.  The wig has allot of hair, but the part is kind of awkward.  I had to manipulate it allot to get it out of my face.  It worked better with a clip, but would also be cute with a scarf or headband.  The wig sheds pretty easily, and because of the thick crown area I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. For the price it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Phi Phi O&#x27;hara from the hit TV show &amp;#34;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race!&amp;#34; I ordered this wig because I am in love with these colors and said what the heck give it a try and see how it looks. First off I received this faster than any of the other packages I have ordered which shocked me and then when I actually held the product the colors were true to this picture, the quality of the hair is great and it was SO FULL! I am so happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to buy more from them! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post pictures and what not with me in this as soon as I have my next show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWITTER - @PhiPhiOhara&lt;br /&gt;INSTAGRAM - @PhiPhiOhara&lt;br /&gt;FACEBOOK - Facebook.com/PhiPhiOhara&lt;br /&gt;EMAIL - PhiPhiOhara@Gmail.com</li>
            <li> Cute color and length, but the hair is very obviously cheap and synthetic.  Better for a costume look than every day wear.</li>
            <li> I loveeee this wig. I have great hair but I get lazy lol. and I also love the chance this gives me to change my hair color. It came lightining fast! loves how the lavender shined! I told people I did it myself! thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> Awful! Ordered this wig because it looked super cute. Didn&#x27;t look anything in the picture it was brown like dirt brown and the purple vibrant but stood out way to much you could clearly see the cap. Where the brown didn&#x27;t continue and the purple started a good inch under the b rown! I will post pics tomorrow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product i wear it just to wear!</li>
            <li> Love this wig!!!! Looks so real. Super soft and the color is so pretty. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It looks really fake, it&#x27;s way too shiny, and the colors weren&#x27;t the ones they were supposed to be. Packaging was horrible, it came in a baggie inside a baggie. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase from the seller again. I was really disappointed with this wig in general. I decided not to return it but I cut it and used dry shampoo to try and remove the shine.  It didn&#x27;t have much of an effect. &#x27;Expected quality for a cheap wig&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Nice quality but if you have long hair the cap is too small to hold all if your hair and these are non returnable.</li>
            <li> Just got this like 30 minutes ago. It looks awesome!  It itches yes, but so do my expensive extensions as well...so it was expected.  I had to fiddle around with the placement of it on my head to make it look more natural and bobby-pinned one of the sides so it&#x27;s not all in my face but it&#x27;s a beautiful wig and for the price it&#x27;s well worth it.  Glad I got it, it&#x27;s something you can wear day-to-day and it doesn&#x27;t look like a costume wig.  It&#x27;s in style and looks totally unique and different.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say \\&quot;GO FOR IT!!!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> My purchase was not as satisfying. My wig turned out to be a light blonde that fades into a lavender. It doesn&#x27;t look like it is shown on here.</li>
            <li> I guess I have a big head and it was a little difficult to fit, but once I got it, it looked so cute! It doesn&#x27;t tangle much and it&#x27;s so pretty, maybe a little less purple and more pinky but it&#x27;s so pretty!!</li>
            <li> I loved how this wig looked straight out of the packaging. The coloring is less brown and more blonde, and the curls are just lovely. It&#x27;s a great length and looks a lot better with a hat, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle ombre effect but the front of the wig is a crooked mess.  I wish it had a more natural hairline ):</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig!!! Its my first one! I got it earlier then expected which was awesome and when I opened it i was blown away with its beautiful color. My wig is a little different in color then the picture. The brown is more of an ash blonde then brown which I like better. The hair is so soft. I wore it out and a girl said that I had the most prettiest hair she had ever seen and wanted to know who my stylist was. When I let her in on my secret she couldn&#x27;t believe it!! I worn this wig for a week straight and it hardly tangled or shed I just combed it gently and applied a little hairspray to a few fly aways. I can&#x27;t believe I got such an incredible good quality real looking long lasting wig for so cheap of a price!! I will be buying all my wigs through this company!!</li>
            <li> I got this for a GREAT deal - under $9!! I LOVE it! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous. The \\&quot;brown\\&quot; part of it makes it look almost a greyish color at the top since it&#x27;s blended with the lilac, but it looks interesting and it&#x27;s really pretty. It has a zig zag part at the top, which I think makes it look a little bit more natural. It&#x27;s very long, soft, and full. Shipping was also only a little over a week. Can&#x27;t wait to wear this out.</li>
            <li> I love it! shipping super fast! it was packaged pretty good.</li>
            <li> Received item today...very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Good quality and shipped faster than described.</li>
            <li> The wig we got was in good order... but the purple wasn&#x27;t as pronounced as it was in the image, but not really enough to really complain about it.</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price only thing is that you can see the weave a lil bit and this wig is a lil darker then shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> fit was good, colours were okay, but I ordered two for an event, and they were two completely different wigs. one was extremely curly and light, the other was wavy at best and dark.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this wig. The colors are great and the hair is so soft - it&#x27;s very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: The top is rather strange. Not a very believable part, on me. The cap is also REALLY small. I shave my head and have NO IDEA how someone with hair would ever get this wig over it. The cap does not have sideburn flaps like some of my other wigs, so I have to wear the hair down and my styling options are a little limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very thin, which looks natural at the bottom, but the wefts show at the top. I wear it with a hat, but will probably end up getting some extensions and sewing them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I LOVE this wig. It&#x27;s such a pretty color and would make a GREAT everyday wig if I can figure out how to fix the showing wefts.</li>
            <li> I wear this wig whenever I don&#x27;t feel like doing my hair. It&#x27;s very pretty and doesn&#x27;t shed a lot. Very important.</li>
            <li> So a few days ago, I saw that Phi Phi O&#x27;Hara bought and reviewed this wig. So naturally I was even more excited that I ordered it! I got it in the mail today. EXTREMELY fast shipping! From China to Alabama took 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this wig it initially had no reviews. So I was pretty skeptical at first. I mean, I have never seen a good, cheap wig. You usually get what you pay for when it comes to wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG. This wig is truly amazing. It&#x27;s nice and matte like natural hair, and the gradient coloring is PERFECT. The curls are nice and bouncy and the wig fibers are just insanely soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINITELY be ordering from this seller again soon!</li>
            <li> i love it. its cheap and i mean ive gotten a lot of compliments saying it looks expensive and very realistic and not even like a wig however since its far from my first wig i wouldnt say its the best quality. however, for what it is, its fantastic. on the other side, the brown is way more blonde and theres hardly any purple on the ends just some lilac highlights. still, its fun and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> Fun and beautiful. Quality was much higher than I anticipated. Only down side is that the hair cap is black, wish it was brown like the hair.</li>
            <li> Nice wig, but there is an area on the right side where you can see the black undercap showing through. Nothing I do will cover it. I usually have to wear it with a hat. Not sure if this is a defect with this one wig, or a general defect in the line.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing. It&#x27;s full and thick. The hair is soft and the color is true to the photo. The wig feels high quality and stable. You can also report the front or move the bangs around to better suit your style.</li>
            <li> I like the color, however the top of the wig is very bulky and unnatural so its best worn with a hat.  Other than that I like it and the shipping was faster than expected.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fun wig pretty colors... Held up real nice easy to style..</li>
            <li> I bought this wig with the mind set that it wasnt gonna be all that, that it would tangle easy, be really thin, barely have curls... But I got lucky! It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it... And now my mother even wants one too... I don&#x27;t ever want to take it off! Seriously I&#x27;d be like 12 more just to have them! I&#x27;m in love... 5 stars well deserved!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Needed minimal styling. Much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and high quality than most wigs at this price range. Could still tell it was a wig in person, but not in some of the pictures taken while I wore it.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful wig l just got it was very surprise when l receive because it only took like 2 weeks to get here l was more surprise when l opened it looked so real n soft I own about 100 wigs n payed a lot of money for them , this wig here is a most have to was nice n full so real and will made love it love it love it lol</li>
            <li> It was ok, wig cap shows threw and gets tangled like crazy, sadly it doesnt look good on me so i dont really wear it out unless its like a party or for cosplay, all in all its ok, sheds alot, main problem is the cap that showes underneath</li>
            <li> Just received my wig. As I suspected, the colors were slightly off. Instead of brunette and pink I got blonde and lavender. I like these colors much better. It&#x27;s a beautiful, long wig, brushes out wonderfully. My one complaint-knocking it down a star-is how easy it is to have the top show through the hair. Not a big deal, that&#x27;s why we invented fascinators. :)</li>
            <li> Tanhlrs easily, but very pretty. As pictured.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig, but I can say that it&#x27;s amazing! It looks exactly like the picture shows. The colors are spot on. It&#x27;s comfortable and the hair feels like it could pass for real. I&#x27;m going to be ordering more wigs from X&amp;YAngel soon. :D Very pleased!</li>
            <li> VERY WELL MADE AND A FUN WIG</li>
            <li> Looks great easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wonderfully fantastic wig for such a low price. it looks just like the picture regarding the colors. it&#x27;s nice and full, and I love the part; so cute and well done. the wig itself is exceptionally well made. no complaints from this customer. oh, and it came just 10 days after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig for a great price, the colors are cute and the curls and fullness are just right. I love the idea of the zig-zag part but either I got a bad one or it&#x27;s just not for me, I prefer the bangs that hide the hairline of the wig. The part where the zig-zag starts shows a little bit of the tracks. I can just wear a hat with it. I&#x27;ve bought several wigs from this seller and they have excellent customer service. I posted images and I have several more posted here: [...]</li>
            <li> I have three other wigs, one of which was purchased from Amazon and without problems. This wig, however, isn&#x27;t even worth it for cosplay let alone everyday use. The wig is not nearly as long as it shows in the pictures not to mention that there is so little hair in the wig you can see the netting without even looking closely. If you&#x27;re going to use this for halloween and want a budget wig for a costume this may be suitable. For anything else there isn&#x27;t enough hair to cover anything. To break it down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shorter than it appears in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too thin to be functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t sit properly due to the way the wig is constructed.</li>
            <li> The curls were Very soft and bouncy, and with some work the wig could look completely natural!(and by work I just mean fitting and such.) It wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all, and I could run a comb through the wig(curl by curl) without any problems!&lt;br /&gt;It also got here really early. It came nearly 31/2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this wig but then I do! If you wear a hat with this wig it looks nice but if you don&#x27;t wanna wear a hat or can&#x27;t then this wig is not for you! If looks like you have a wig on</li>
            <li> Just like the picture, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Really cute! Didn&#x27;t notice any fall-out. Looks just like it shows in the picture. Like other reviews have said, the parting in the top is a little strange - could probably be fixed to personal taste, but I&#x27;ll probably just wear a hat with it. Thanks for the cute wig!</li>
            <li> Wig is pretty blond, not as ashy as in the picture. Besides that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This wig is sandy blonde with a hint of lavender. I will be returning this wig, it&#x27;s not like the photo at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite wigs! I bought it thinking it would be a cute mock wig for Halloween, and being a seasoned wig buyer I was impressed! When I first opened the package the color threw me off and was a little displeasing. I thought the cap would be too small and the curls would come out to quickly. I also thought it would be too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was completely wrong. I love it! I&#x27;ve worn it out a few times now and the curl is sti holding. The color looks fine in the long run, and even though it&#x27;s a little on the thin side it covers everything just right. I&#x27;ve brushed it, washed it, worn it outside and inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would buy it again, the only down side is it takes a while to find the right seem to hide the wig cap at. So I cheated and used a hat. Good job xy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality. Had to play around with the way it is sectioned in front, made a waterfall braid in front going down the side and its AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> I adore this wig! Its beatiful and soft. I can brush it out with no problems even on windy montana days. No netting shows through anywhere,  in fact its almost too thick for my small head (I buy childrens hats because they fit better). The adjustable straps, however, still hold it snug. Ive had ladies ask me where I get my hair done when I wear it out. There is no shedding to speak of, unless I brush it too hard. It came very curly, amost shirley temple curls but I didnt mind. When I brush it out, it eventually curls back into big barrel curls that boing in my face, so I just pin it back. I also bought a straight wig from these guys. I wore it ever day for almost two weeks straight, hair sprayed it, threw it on the floor at night, fell asleep on the couch in it once, and I could still brush it straight. After purchasing from other sellers, I only buy from these guys. Shipping can take some time coming from asia, but it is so worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Not the same color on the picture.</li>
            <li> This WIG IS SO CUTE...........................................................( MILLION STARS&lt;br /&gt;This wig is  very well done .............^^&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful wig craftsmanship............^^&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this wig to everyone ^^)</li>
            <li> Just love this wig. I wanted a softer look for our weekend away and this was perfect. Arrived super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> This wig is okay... I mean it wasn&#x27;t even close to the color in the pictures shown... But it&#x27;s still cute. I mean I&#x27;m not too crazy over it</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty wig it looks exactly like the picture but mine is blonde not brown like the picture or grey like some reviews but either way it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I really wish there was a 2.5 stars. I love X&amp;Y hair. I really do. However, this wig differed from all the wigs I purchased before. It took 18 days to get here, it didn&#x27;t even leave china for 10 of those days. When it came it was very VERY curly. I had to brush them out because they looked so unnatural and they immediately tangled. I had no choice but to straighten the wig, it straightened very nicely but I did want it curly. Front pieces tend to fall in your face, top is very bulky and looks super unnatural. Color is true to picture, is soft and long, will not re-curl.</li>
            <li> I got this exact wig from a seller on etsy for $117 and wish I had spotted this sooner! I feel cheated!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite wig. I get compliments on it all the time. I wore it to the point I was wearing it out everyday. It&#x27;s now gotten thin at the top because of brushing, but I still wear the sucker, but up in a pony tail with it styled so it looks great still with a white head band on. Damn I wish I had gotten it here! I am now though! XD</li>
            <li> beautiful can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
            <li> So beautiful, really...I feel like an angel in this wig!  the seller is super kind, I had some issues with it getting to me and I think the first order got lost, they were totally nice and kept in contact with me to make sure that I was satified.</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely stunning in person. It looks like real hair, the coloration is subtle, it&#x27;s comfortable, and easily styled.  I used this for my Halloween costume this year, and received TONS of compliments.. it really is beautiful, and  I wish I could wear it every day!!</li>
            <li> Love this wig! The colors are adorable, but I wish it was straight so I&#x27;m going to do that this weekend with boiling water! I recommend for sure! Thanks so much^.^</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing!  It&#x27;s a blend of light brown, pale pink, and purple/lavender, very feminine.  It is super soft and thick, and the curls keep their shape.  I love this wig!  The bangs you can keep as they are to the side, or make them sweeping in sort of a U shape. For the money I paid for this one, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I&#x27;ve paid more for other synthetic wigs of supposed &#x27;better quality&#x27; that either shed horribly, or become matted after wearing once.  Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> My first wig ever and it&#x27;s ok. I kinda expected it to be a little darker but I can&#x27;t complain.  I like the lavender color and the price also it came the day it had predicted ^__^</li>
            <li> I DO like this wig, super soft, curls are beautiful but am on the fence about keeping or returning. I normally wear my hair dark with big chunks of cherry red highlights but thought this would be fun and spice things up a bit but does fit a bit odd and the colors are a bit off from the pictures. Still debating so will try it on again and then make my decision.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with what I received. It&#x27;s not the wig it was an extension. I am pissed and I need a wig. I just think it&#x27;s dumb and a waste of time and money, ugh!</li>
            <li> Look too shiny, and fake</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous, even better in person!</li>
            <li> This wig is good quality, gorgeous, and adjustable. Definitely recommend it. It took awhile to get here, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it! Super fun, easy to wear. Thinner than it could be but otherwise a great deal.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  I guess I should not expect much for $14, but this was even worse than expected.  Wig photographs so fake looking as well. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the model in the picture.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. I selected this very light one with the lavender ends. I got a deep brunet with the lighter ends... It does not look good at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but also could be a smidge better. Mine came in as a blonde color with lilac tones, not bad really except my hair is blonde so I cant work with it :), its long and fits comfortably. But ill wear a hat with it of course</li>
            <li> Just put it on and very easy to shed. Cute wig, definitely get what you paid for. Colours are not as shown.</li>
            <li> SO BEAUTIFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig is EXACTLY like picture. grey and purple, blended very nicely together. there&#x27;s A LOT of hair, and it&#x27;s very nice and full. curls are very defined an very pretty. wig is super soft and not shiny. the front part is a bit off, but you can always wear a hat, or try to move the parting a little bit. the part on top is zigzag, so it won&#x27;t part straight. but I made mine a bit more of a side part instead of a center part with a bit of hair spray and a pin. love ittt~</li>
            <li> Like it a lot but sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> I do but I don&#x27;t like this wig. Because I love the colors and length, but I hate how I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; the part to switch the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; to.</li>
            <li> cons: arrived late, shipped to wrong address, has bangs, purple color is only at bottom inch of hair, only had a couple waves, tangles easy. doesnt look like picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: super soft, no wig shine, looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a good wig. had some faults, but pretty amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> So beautiful!  It looks very natural, not big on the top like the other reviews say. LOVE this wig. Shiny like natural hair and not that weird thick plastic feeling of other cheap wigs. If this is a good example of this company&#x27;s wigs I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> WOW! So cheap! so amazing! everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair and was asking me about my stylist&#x27;s name!!!!! I am buying 3 more to give to my girlfriends who loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to wearing a wig is to line it up with your natural hairline, get rid of the real shiny fake look by using hairspray, and to cut a few wispy stray hairs around the face area to replicate a real hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper! don&#x27;t think about it just buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> Wig is not true to color in picture</li>
            <li> Overall, I am impressed and quite pleased about the purchase of this unit. The product I received appears somewhat lighter than depicted, but that was a nice suprise. The wig I received appears light-medium champagne blonde than light brown. It is a perfect shade for my complexion. Based on other purchaser&#x27;s uploaded pics the tones, shades, hues, and color blends seem to vary.  Perhaps, the lighting is a factor as well. Once, I adjusted, pinned, and worked with side bangs, it looks great. The wig I received does not appear as full as depicted, but the webbing does not peep through. The wig netting seems tailored for small head sizes. To remedy this, I plan to add netting around the edges and add clips in order to completely cover my hairline for wind factor purposes.  Yesterday, I wore this wig for the first time,  I tied a small colorful groovy scarf around the crown, and I received several compliments  and rubber necking while driving. :-)  I was concerned about drastic change from my Winter style  (dark roots &amp; berry).  With minor adjustments at my end (i.e., makeup and etc.) as per usual when shifting seasons, this wig for a Spring-Summer switch up.</li>
            <li> Such a great wig, totally beat my expectation!! Nice and full, lovely curls, and it&#x27;s just beautiful!! Definitely ordering more wigs from them :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it came almost two weeks early; received it today C:</li>
            <li> The wig itself is lovely, the colors are beautiful. The only issue I have with it is that part of the lining actually shows at the hairline right where the part is.  It seems like the only way to fix it would be to take small scissors and trim that part very carefully, although I haven&#x27;t attempted it yet because I don&#x27;t want to ruin the wig, but I also don&#x27;t really want to wear it around with the lining showing.  I was really excited when I bought it but I&#x27;ve only worn it twice because I&#x27;m embarrassed that the lining shows.</li>
            <li> This wig has such phenomenal coloring, and it is incredibly soft, I was shocked to find that it rarely tangles. The donwside to it is that mine came with some weird kinks at the top that look pretty ugly (sort of like how hair dries in weird ways after you take a shower and fall asleep on it) and because the wig isn&#x27;t  heat resistant (it will melt, don&#x27;t try it) there&#x27;s nothing I can do about them. As long as  I wear a hat over it though, it looks fantastic. I found there was too much hair at the front of the wig and ended up cutting bangs into it, which really isn&#x27;t a downside, just something for you to note when purchasing it. Also, it is much curlier than the picture. The picture depicts beach waves, but the actual wig is very curly.</li>
            <li> First, I have to admit that this was impressive for the price. I fully expected a cheap costume wig that was shiny and flimsy. Instead, it&#x27;s thick, full, natural looking, and fully able to stand up to day to day wear. HOWEVER, this wig is blonde. Not brown. Not brownish-blonde. Straight up, out of the bottle blonde. The purple is pretty close to what&#x27;s pictured, but the blonde is...overwhelming. For the price I paid, it&#x27;s not a bad wig, and I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed with my purchase, but I really wish the colours were truer to the advertisement.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s so cute. The curls are so springy and adorable. I wear it with a beanie or a hat usually, just so it looks more natural. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s review this wig.&lt;br /&gt;A) the color is more of a deep auburn and lilac&lt;br /&gt;B) the cap is too small for someone with either a big head or thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;SN: I felt it slipping off my head while taking the photo&lt;br /&gt;C). It was a little long for my taste, so I ended up cutting some off&lt;br /&gt;D) it looks much better with a hat on</li>
            <li> This is clearly my favourite wig I own. :) The part is a little wonky, but ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; a fascinator or hat or flower crown can&#x27;t fix! By wonky, I mean it looks wig-ish. It&#x27;s a zig zag part down the middle. But oh those colours! I actually intend to dye my hair exactly like this wig! It also withstood being in the rain for an entire camping weekend without issue. It shed very little and untangles easily with a wide-tooth comb. It&#x27;s thick, and I can&#x27;t get over how gorgeous the curls are. They will get a little stringy, so bring that comb with you and, just like long hair in general, pass the comb through a few times throughout the day to retain that beautiful soft curl.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this wig! It&#x27;s more of a blonde with little hints of purple. Super pretty and looks incredibly real! will definitely buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> this wig is amazing!!! so cute, beautiful colour, and very soft. colour is a bit more violet than shown. it does tangle easily and has a weird part, so i have to knock off one star, but this can just be fixed with a flower crown or a hat. overall would recommend. â™¥â™¥â™¥</li>
            <li> Not that I don&#x27;t love this wig, but it can get tangly and when brushing it whit a wig brush some hair does fall out but so far still love it!!!</li>
            <li> This wig looked so beautiful out of the package. It was very flowy and soft. About an hour of passing around and wearing at our game night (we&#x27;re just that odd) the wig started to get tangled looking. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will hold up, but we&#x27;ll see I guess! Another note is that the bangs are out of this world in your face and cumbersome. It&#x27;s a cheap and fun wig if you&#x27;re silly like me and just want to have wigs around.</li>
            <li> This came in the day it said it would.. When I opened it up, (Neatly packaged and whatnot) I kinda looked at it like, &amp;#34;ugh, this wig cap ain&#x27;t gonna fit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It looks super-small, but I&#x27;ve got a fat German head and really long hair, and I got it to fit relatively painlessly. I&#x27;ve worn it outside a couple times now. I kinda like all the stupefied looks I get from people (currently living in a town of old people, lot of staring), but it&#x27;s one of the best wigs I own. Of course I buy mostly $7-$10 wigs, but this was a $10 wig and I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s not too shiny, the crown doesn&#x27;t show any netting, and it came SUPER curly... I&#x27;ve since brushed some of it out so I could add a more &amp;#34;Natural beach curl&amp;#34; look to it. But It works, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great wig for photo shoots! Cut a few inches off the bottom and it looks much more full.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. I&#x27;m really happy with how it looks and feels. Which is surprising because I thought it was suppose to be brown and purple. Its blonde and purple. But it still looks good, just not what I expected. I double checked and it suppose to be brown, I didn&#x27;t order wrong. That&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing and I love it; the color I got is more of a greyish blonde than ash brown in the picture but that&#x27;s fine with me. I was a bit skeptical because it parts in the middle and that doesn&#x27;t really fit me, but I was able to move it around and it fits great! It&#x27;s not too curly. I&#x27;ve been complimented about my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;(wig) before when i wear it out, and looks realistic. I took several crappy pictures lol just on how I styled it and hopefully you can see the color (webcam quality cx)</li>
