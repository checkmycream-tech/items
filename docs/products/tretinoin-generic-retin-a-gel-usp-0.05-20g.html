            <li>Wonderful smooth creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li>Then I would take a warm wash cloth and lay it on my face for a minute and then wipe the excess oil off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a popular misconception that steaming the face improves acne and complexion.</li>
            <li>so I came on line to see if I could get a comparable product on my own.</li>
            <li>However, when the Tretinoin arrived, it was brand new in perfect condition just as the seller had described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Amazon prime member for a couple years now, and am normally happy with my purchases, but this is my first review.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered trentinoin 0.05 from Benjays and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li>If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the way it works.</li>
            <li>That seems to be working better for me.</li>
            <li>I went to the beach this week and made sure my face was covered with zinc-oxide, broad-spectrum formula SPF 70.</li>
            <li>am very happy with my results, only been using it a couple of weeks, but I can already tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I like this much more than the 0.02 renova I was using..</li>
            <li>It works amazingly, and very fast as well.  </li>
            <li>In addition to healing damaged skin, jojoba oil has helpedto combat the oiliness I have experienced since starting Retin-A.</li>
            <li>Exposure to Sunlight and Ultra-violet light must be avoided during treatment.</li>
            <li>skin care is extremely important in acne and helping a person recover from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Photoprotection is an important adjunct for individuals with acne or acne prone</li>
            <li>-Ret Gel is available in three strengths - 0.025% w/w Tretinoin, 0.05% w/w Tretinoin and 0.1%</li>
            <li>/&gt;A-Ret Cream is available in strength of 0.025% w/w Tretinoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>out of reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;-Not to be used during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;-Exposure to Sunlight and Ultra-violet light must be avoided.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see that tretinoid products were available on this site, as I cannot afford to see a doctor for a prescription, nor can I afford these at the original retail costs.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days and my skin is already super smooth.  </li>
            <li>used under medical supervision, Tretinoin is regarded to be the most effective comedolytic agent.&lt;br /&gt;Tretinoin unplugs acne follicles and brings acne pimples (comedones) to the surface.</li>
            <li>or acne prone skin requires special attention with regard to cosmetics, cleansing and Sun</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll make sure to give updates during my treatment as to whether or not this product is working as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li>face with mild soap (Acnelak Soap),</li>
            <li>face with a mild soap or face wash.&lt;br /&gt;-Style</li>
            <li>This product came quickly and was just as it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It made my skin peel (micro-peeling) at first, which I was expecting, but the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Much too strong.</li>
            <li>For those of you who&#x27;ve not used this before, it&#x27;s important to know that this should be applied at night only, before moisturizing, and using more of it does not mean it works better or faster.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, the price was right, and I will buy this formula again.</li>
            <li>Gently squeeze a pea size amount of the gel/cream on your clean fingertip and spread it mildly on the affected area each night before retiring.</li>
            <li>Do not let medication enter into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Tretinoin makes the skin more sensitive too sunlight and can cause dryness, redness, tenderness, swelling of the skin and a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>This came before Obagi did, so I couldn&#x27;t use it right away.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin was good before (due to years of use) but now it seems extra clear, and absolutely flawless- aside from the normal initial purging (which was mild as there&#x27;s probably nothing much to erupt under the surface anyway).</li>
            <li>It makes your skin more sensitive to sun, and direct exposure will undo anything you&#x27;re trying to achieve (in my case, fine-line prevention and lightening of mild hyperpigmentation on my forehead).</li>
            <li>I am back buying more.</li>
            <li>The first week I used every night.</li>
            <li>The delivery was extremely fast!  </li>
            <li>Maybe because it is a lower percentage, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>can be dry/irritating at first so start at one every three nights then go to nightly.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li>really like the way this product feels on my oily summertime skin!  </li>
            <li>I plan to order more but in a stronger strength next time.  </li>
            <li>This product is .05%, it is a smooth &amp; easy to apply, light weight white gel, not clear.</li>
            <li>great product to use to keep pours open, fix trouble skin and create healthier smoother skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and the product has worked wonders.  </li>
            <li>even though I moisturized the morning after and gently scrubbed with a microfiber cloth still my face kept pealing.</li>
            <li>Similarly, Sunlight/Ultra Violet Light was thought to be beneficial in acne.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to adjust to the correct amount to use as it is much stronger than any OTC</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out as much as before.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this really works.</li>
            <li>A pea-size amount spread over face is really sufficient.</li>
            <li>feels much nicer on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast, and packaged professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The milder strength is perfect for me as I have thin fragile skin.</li>
            <li>have cut down using fash washes and using cooler water instead, eating fish oil, getting more vitamin d, along with this at night.</li>
            <li>for people with troubled, discolored, or acne skin, i highly recommend taking lots of fish oil and vitamin d, along with zinc, for healthy glowing, clear complexion and acne free skin, it may get worse at first, but it will soon after be great.</li>
            <li>A-Ret gel/cream is a potent medicine, which is prescribed not only in Acne Vulgaris &amp; Photoageing, but also for certain other skin disorders as well.</li>
            <li>decided to write this review right now as an \\&quot;initial reaction\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Adding a little bronzer at night was more than enough to match facial skin tone to the light tan on my body.</li>
            <li>LTD.&lt;br /&gt;12, DLF Industrial Area, Najafgarh Road, New Delhi-110015.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use with my newly purchased Obagi system.</li>
            <li>revealing new skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>After I get out of the shower in the morning, I do the same exact procedure as listed above and my skin in oil-free all day and is ready to go at night when I put my Retin-A</li>
            <li>I was using a 0.02%Rx cream prior to this for a year and at first, this really peeled my skin and turned it red-</li>
            <li>It helps to clear my skin without drying it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it makes me peel a whole lot.</li>
            <li>My skin got really sensitive and would burn if I put anything but water on it.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this was probably written by someone in India, so it may not make complete sense</li>
            <li>Too frequent washings may also aggravate the condition.</li>
            <li>face.&lt;br /&gt;-Keep items that touch the face and hair directly</li>
            <li>in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;-Replace cap tightly after use.&lt;br /&gt;-Keep</li>
            <li>While it is true that brief exposure to moist heat will soften comedones prior to their physical removal, repeated and chronic exposure to moist heat actually aggravates acne and may even lead to a form of tropical acne.</li>
            <li>First 2 to 3 weeks may cause discomfort due to irritation, which eventually should subside.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not apply oily foundation thickly as the fine particles will enter and block hair pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have used real Retin A in the past and this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>On the label as far as ingredients it only states \\&quot;tretinoin and base\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I would order from them again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Works exactly the same for me, for far less money.</li>
            <li>(there were a few minor spelling errors and grammatical errors that I attempted to fix, while still keeping the text in its original form):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Non-drying, but fast absorbing and non-greassy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am 19 years old, dry skin and oily nose.</li>
            <li>Only a little redness at first under my chin, which only I could see, and the littlest bit of peeling around my nose.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Retin-A (it&#x27;s pricey) and decided to give Tretinoin a try.  Works exactly the same for me, for far less money.</li>
            <li> This actually is what it&#x27;s called. On the label as far as ingredients it only states \\&quot;tretinoin and base\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days and my skin is already super smooth.  It is starting to flake in some areas but that is what it is supposed to do (regenerate your skin).  The milder strength is perfect for me as I have thin fragile skin. Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I didn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor to get a prescription.  It works amazingly, and very fast as well.  I use about a quarter size amount on my face and bring it down to my chest, where I have occasional break outs.  The only con is that the product last about 3 weeks to a month, it is relatively small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the product has worked wonders.  I am back buying more.</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old, dry skin and oily nose. I have hormonal breakouts and hyperpigmentation. I have been using this for a little over a month and my skin has dramatically changed. The hyperpigmentation has dramatically decreased. It has also helped with the acne and premature wrinkles I had on my forehead. This is definitely a HG for me. The only downside is it makes me peel a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if product even works, the tube shows the product expired on 10/2011, I ordered it March 2012!  Urghhh... I wonder if it looses it strength/effectiveness.  READ LABEL BEFORE OPENING!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered trentinoin 0.05 from Benjays and I am very happy with my purchase. I have used this product in the past and this was the lowest price. As advised by the manufacturer, use sunscreen  when you use this product. I have been using this for a couple of weeks and my face looks great.</li>
            <li> I have used real Retin A in the past and this is not the real thing. Wasnt that happy with the product. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> There was no ingredient list on the box to tell you what was inside the \\&quot;gel base\\&quot; and the company, when I inquired, was not able to tell me. Therefore, I don&#x27;t use the product anymore.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this, I used it three nights in a row. It created more acne then I had before (which its supposed to do. It gets worse before it gets better) and dried out my skin so I could literally peal it off my face (also supposed to do that). My make up would look horrible even though I moisturized the morning after and gently scrubbed with a microfiber cloth still my face kept pealing. I had to sit in front of the mirror and pluck at the skin on my face for at least an hour. My skin got really sensitive and would burn if I put anything but water on it. My face got so bad my fiance asked me to stop using the gel. If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, go with the 0.025% maybe? I&#x27;m trying something else now but if it fails I guess I&#x27;ll have to come back to this and just deal with looking disgusting for a few weeks or more. :(</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Tretinoin (Generic Retin-A) Gel USP 0.05% 20g\\&quot; from tinyforless on June 12, 2012 with an estimated arrival date between the 18th and 21st. It arrived today at 2pm and I am pleased with the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out of my prescription 45g 0.05% Retin-A cream last night, so I am relieved that I have a replacement to keep my skin looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to write this review right now as an \\&quot;initial reaction\\&quot;...I&#x27;ll be posting pictures of the product I received, the box thingy it came in and I will type up the leaflet, as well. I know that I was extremely hesitant about buying this product online, especially since it was manufactured in India. I will definitely be coming back to update y&#x27;all on how the product works, too (although it might be a little while considering how long it takes to see results!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**By the way, I just wanted to share a little tip that helped me to avoid the negative side effects while using Retin-A: As stated before, I used the cream, but they both have the same active ingredient so I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;ll produce the same results. Now, when I first started using Retin-A, my skin became extremely red and was flaking so badly that it hurt to move. I stopped using Retin-A for a few days and began using jojoba oil (it&#x27;s not actually an oil...it&#x27;s a wax ester. look it up. it tricks the skin into thinking that it is producing enough oil AND doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts) as a moisturizer...I would massage it into my face for upwards of ten minutes and skin would be peeling off like crazy. Then I would take a warm wash cloth and lay it on my face for a minute and then wipe the excess oil off. If my skin still felt tight (it usually did), I would take a few drops and rub it in my skin and be done! Jojoba oil has worked wonders on my skin; I was able to start using Retin-A again a few days later and haven&#x27;t dealt with any of the negative side effects since. In addition to healing damaged skin, jojoba oil has helpedto combat the oiliness I have experienced since starting Retin-A. After I get out of the shower in the morning, I do the same exact procedure as listed above and my skin in oil-free all day and is ready to go at night when I put my Retin-A on. Keep in mind that a little goes a very long way and if you put too much on you WILL have an oily face...learned that the hard way.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the text of the leaflet that came enclosed in the box thingy. Keep in mind that this was probably written by someone in India, so it may not make complete sense (there were a few minor spelling errors and grammatical errors that I attempted to fix, while still keeping the text in its original form):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Should be used under the advice of a Doctor. Information &amp; guidelines provided here are to help you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-RET &amp; ACNE&lt;br /&gt;A-RET CONTAINS TRETINOIN IN GEL/CREAM BASE&lt;br /&gt;When used under medical supervision, Tretinoin is regarded to be the most effective comedolytic agent.&lt;br /&gt;Tretinoin unplugs acne follicles and brings acne pimples (comedones) to the surface. This is why acne looks worse in the first few weeks of treatment with Tretinoin.&lt;br /&gt;(this part is highlighted) -&gt; The cream base is preferred for dry skin and the gels are preferred for oily skin. &lt;-&lt;br /&gt;A-Ret Gel/Cream should be used strictly under guidance of your Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;Wash face with mild soap (Acnelak Soap), pat dry with a towel-let face dry for 10 to 15 minutes before applying A-Ret Gel/Cream. Gently squeeze a pea size amount of the gel/cream on your clean fingertip and spread it mildly on the affected area each night before retiring. Excess amount of gel/cream must not be used. Do not let medication enter into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Tretinoin makes the skin more sensitive too sunlight and can cause dryness, redness, tenderness, swelling of the skin and a burning sensation. These side effects lessen with time. If the skin becomes too red and dry, decrease the application to everyother night or even every third night. Consult your Doctor who may advise you to use lower strength gel/cream or decrease the amount of the gel/cream. First 2 to 3 weeks may cause discomfort due to irritation, which eventually should subside.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t self medicate or use any other topical treatment unless otherwise prescribed by your Doctor. It may take 3 to 4 months before improvement is observed. Exposure to Sunlight and Ultra-violet light must be avoided during treatment. If unavoidable, use Sunscreen Lotion (U.V. Dew 15 Plus Lotion).&lt;br /&gt;Not to be used during pregnancy unless advised by your Doctor. A-Ret gel/cream is a potent medicine, which is prescribed not only in Acne Vulgaris &amp; Photoageing, but also for certain other skin disorders as well. Your Doctor may prolong the treatment for a long period.&lt;br /&gt;Good skin care is extremely important in acne and helping a person recover from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME GENERAL INFORMATION&lt;br /&gt;Acne or acne prone skin requires special attention with regard to cosmetics, cleansing and Sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;Foremost among the prophylactic measures is the use of non-comedogenic and non-acnegenic cosmetics and the avoidance of agents known to promote acne such as Hair Pomades. Use of greasy/oily cosmetics and picking and fiddling of lesions aggravate acne. Too frequent washings may also aggravate the condition. Wash your face twice daily in the morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;There is a popular misconception that steaming the face improves acne and complexion. While it is true that brief exposure to moist heat will soften comedones prior to their physical removal, repeated and chronic exposure to moist heat actually aggravates acne and may even lead to a form of tropical acne. Similarly, Sunlight/Ultra Violet Light was thought to be beneficial in acne. In fact, short exposure to Sunlight may hasten the resolution of inflammatory lesions and suntan can mask the lesions. However, chronic exposure leads to thickening of the Epidermisand follicle, resulting in subsequent aggravation of acne. Photoprotection is an important adjunct for individuals with acne or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS KEEP THE SKIN CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;-Clean face with a mild soap or face wash.&lt;br /&gt;-Style the hair so that it does not directly touch the forehead and face.&lt;br /&gt;-Keep items that touch the face and hair directly (such a pillows) clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not touch inflamed skin with the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE OF COSMETICS&lt;br /&gt;-Use non-greasy cosmetics formulated especially for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not apply oily foundation thickly as the fine particles will enter and block hair pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHERS&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce consumption of fatty foods such as fatty meat, nuts, chocolates and cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce stress such as that associated with overwork and over exercise.&lt;br /&gt;-All other topical acne agents must be stopped prior to initiating retinoic acid therapy.&lt;br /&gt;Patient compliance is vital in the management of acne as the therapy is long and it takes months to get the benefits of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-Ret Gel is available in three strengths - 0.025% w/w Tretinoin, 0.05% w/w Tretinoin and 0.1% w/w Tretinoin.&lt;br /&gt;A-Ret Cream is available in strength of 0.025% w/w Tretinoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY&lt;br /&gt;-Store in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;-Replace cap tightly after use.&lt;br /&gt;-Keep out of reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;-Not to be used during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;-Exposure to Sunlight and Ultra-violet light must be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufactured in India by :&lt;br /&gt;SHALAKS PHARMACEUTICALS PVT. LTD.&lt;br /&gt;12, DLF Industrial Area, Najafgarh Road, New Delhi-110015.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make sure to give updates during my treatment as to whether or not this product is working as well as the real thing. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product available. I am pleased with the way it works. It helps to clear my skin without drying it. The product was as described and delivery was about a week.</li>
            <li> Have been this product day and night and I have seen absolutely NO results.  I was hoping it would be better than and over the counter product, but I was wrong : (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used OTC retinol products before with no results so I decided to up my skin care ante and try this. I am still trying to adjust to the correct amount to use as it is much stronger than any OTC Vitamin A derivative that you can get. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month. The first week I used every night. Not a good idea. Much too strong. So I backed it off to about twice per week. That seems to be working better for me. No peeling or flaking now and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out as much as before. Time will tell if this really works. As of now, I can&#x27;t report on its effectiveness. Anything is going to take 4 to 6 weeks anyway to show improvement.</li>
            <li> My derm prescribed Retin A for my skin 5 years ago and I used it for 8 month. I moved away and couldnt afford to get to a dermatologist so I came on line to see if I could get a comparable product on my own. This works and Im happy with the results</li>
            <li> I had placed my order on April 3 and the delivery estimate was April 9-12.  I received the Tretinoin on April 5. The delivery was extremely fast!  I bought this product to use with my newly purchased Obagi system. This came before Obagi did, so I couldn&#x27;t use it right away. However, when the Tretinoin arrived, it was brand new in perfect condition just as the seller had described. I&#x27;m currently using it with my Obagi and it&#x27;s working like a charm.  It was a great price.  The service was great.  The delivery was awesome.  I would order from them again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that tretinoid products were available on this site, as I cannot afford to see a doctor for a prescription, nor can I afford these at the original retail costs. I ordered from tinyforless, and it arrived in three days. To clarify something I saw from someone else&#x27;s review regarding expiration- the date on the tube is when it was manufactured, not the expiration. The tube states it is expires 24 months AFTER that date. Mine was January of this year, so it is well within the limits of its efficacy. My skin took to it extremely well. Only a little redness at first under my chin, which only I could see, and the littlest bit of peeling around my nose. For those of you who&#x27;ve not used this before, it&#x27;s important to know that this should be applied at night only, before moisturizing, and using more of it does not mean it works better or faster. A pea-size amount spread over face is really sufficient. It is also imperative that you apply sunscreen religiously after you start using this. It makes your skin more sensitive to sun, and direct exposure will undo anything you&#x27;re trying to achieve (in my case, fine-line prevention and lightening of mild hyperpigmentation on my forehead). I went to the beach this week and made sure my face was covered with zinc-oxide, broad-spectrum formula SPF 70. Adding a little bronzer at night was more than enough to match facial skin tone to the light tan on my body. In any case, I recommend both this vendor and this product, although since my side effects were almost nil, I&#x27;m going for the stronger concentration (1%) next time.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and was just as it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results, only been using it a couple of weeks, but I can already tell the difference. Retin-A irritated my skin for some reason.  This product does not! Maybe because it is a lower percentage, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> great product to use to keep pours open, fix trouble skin and create healthier smoother skin. have cut down using fash washes and using cooler water instead, eating fish oil, getting more vitamin d, along with this at night. it works great,as it heals scars and dark spots and tightens/refines pours. i did break out for like a week soon after using, but then you will definitely see its big improvement. It prevents some future  breakouts after your body gets used to it (for me a week) and when you do its at a much less magnitude and heals faster (with high amounts for daily intake fish oil and vitamin d). can be dry/irritating at first so start at one every three nights then go to nightly. for people with troubled, discolored, or acne skin, i highly recommend taking lots of fish oil and vitamin d, along with zinc, for healthy glowing, clear complexion and acne free skin, it may get worse at first, but it will soon after be great.</li>
            <li> excellent anti-aging product... I was using a 0.02%Rx cream prior to this for a year and at first, this really peeled my skin and turned it red- but after the redness subsided-(24-48 hrs), it glowed... revealing new skin underneath.  Wonderful smooth creamy consistency.  I like this much more than the 0.02 renova I was using.. feels much nicer on the skin.  Now I just use it every other night on my face, and the redness doesn&#x27;t occur.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so be used to a retinol product well before using this product and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described. This product is .05%, it is a smooth &amp; easy to apply, light weight white gel, not clear. The shipping was extremely fast, and packaged professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lower percent because it is easier on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out and it still does the job.  My dermatologist recommends this for long term use without thinning or damaging the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from tinyforless..... Great seller.  I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product. It made my skin peel (micro-peeling) at first, which I was expecting, but the results were fantastic. Lines on my forehead were less noticeable, and sunspots faded.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product at my sister&#x27;s recommendation and let me tell you she is 48 and her skin is geourgeous. I don&#x27;t know how it will for me since I have only used it for two weeks and she tells me that it takes at least 2 months to see the results. But my bet is on it!!&lt;br /&gt;I received the item sooner than what I thought..which is always a great thing..I&#x27;m going back as soon as the this one finishes ...</li>
            <li> I had a script to retin-a back in the day and now I want it for it&#x27;s anti-aging instead of pimple power. This has the same smell, consistency etc. Seems to be working the same! Take a day off in between nightly application or you may peel a bit.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006TT1KTQ Tretinoin (Generic Retin-A) Gel USP 0.05% 20g]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this product feels on my oily summertime skin!  Not at all irritating to my skin. I use it every other night but once my skin gets accustomed to it, I will use once a night.  I plan to order more but in a stronger strength next time.  Couldn&#x27;t believe I received within a couple of days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A for years, both cream and gel. This formula seems to be the best of both. Non-drying, but fast absorbing and non-greassy, and a little goes a long way. The texture of my skin was good before (due to years of use) but now it seems extra clear, and absolutely flawless- aside from the normal initial purging (which was mild as there&#x27;s probably nothing much to erupt under the surface anyway). Shipping was quick, the price was right, and I will buy this formula again. I&#x27;ve been an Amazon prime member for a couple years now, and am normally happy with my purchases, but this is my first review. Thought it might help someone who&#x27;s skeptical, as I used to either get my tubes on trips to Mexico, then from \\&quot;getcanadiandrugs\\&quot;, but now they require a prescription (which I&#x27;ve had) and the price has gone up over $200!!! Hope that doesn&#x27;t happen with this supplier. The fact that I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A for years has resulted in me looking atleast 10 years younger than I am. When it comes to my skin, exfoliation and lite moisturization is key. This product will do the trick when it comes to exfoliation! Everyones skin is different though, so there&#x27;s no telling. I can say that this formulation works for me!!!</li>
