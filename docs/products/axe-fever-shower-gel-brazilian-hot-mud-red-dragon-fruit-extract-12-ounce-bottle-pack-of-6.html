            <li>However, the first time I used it, and lathered it up, it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is kind of funky.  </li>

            <li>It has kind of an iridescent sparkle to it.  </li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;T :)</li>
            <li>My favorite Body wash of all time.  </li>
            <li>my favorite Body wash I have ever found.</li>
            <li>That alone has made it one of my Top 5 AXE shower gels.    </li>
            <li>I used to buy Axe shower gel all the time, well before they started selling more exotic scents and concoctions.    </li>
            <li>Out of all of these, I would say this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy all the looks and compliments!</li>
            <li>It is more of a polarizing smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a very Unique smell.     </li>
            <li>When you mix to a lather and put it in contact with your skin it makes a very sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>It really does have a pleasant scent, that isn&#x27;t too strong or too light.</li>
            <li>In the bottle it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>Perfect smell and saves me one less item in my cart at the store!  </li>
            <li>As usual great product and service from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>It has a truly unique scent, which I would place somewhere between citrus and musk.</li>
            <li>one is extremely rich and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>but more when i am done with useing this case i bought it leaves my skin fresh and feeling  great wonderfull product they carry other kinds in there product line</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t feel as clean or disenfected if you will with this</li>
            <li>Far superior to any other soaps I&#x27;ve used, simply because of the awesome smell during the washing.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>This prodouct creates lots of lather, stays all day and is complimentary to a number of fragrances that I like to wear.</li>
            <li>The wash beads mixed in give a nice scrubbing feel when applied by hand and the lather spreads and clings to the skin leaving an even sent throughout.</li>
            <li>Not only does it look great, with the bright orange amidst the common dull shower walls, but it smells great, and leaves the whole shower stall smelling fresh.    </li>
            <li>I think the scent is my favorite and there are just enough little scubs in here to get you nice and clean, its alot of fun to use !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great product from Axe, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be for everyone.</li>
            <li>Reverted back to good old fashioned Dial bar or Irisih Spring bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Fun and memorable, but not necessarily</li>
            <li>i prefer this one hot brazilian mudd and grandon fruit extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingly</li>
            <li>in the end, for such a low price, this offer more than most.</li>
            <li>First being Recovery, Recovery, Snake Peel and BOOST.</li>
            <li>In a hot shower, using the soap creates an invigorating scent that I&#x27;ve always thought smells a lot like pine trees.</li>
            <li>Then, it has a very strong peppery overtone to it.  </li>
            <li>It has an amazing, unique smell that (at least for me) took some time to get use to</li>
            <li>fast shipping, product as described.....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling this and the spray in stores, thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>The smell in the 12oz bottle was far to strong and put it for me as a big offset.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I really like this Axe shower gel, and I have tried most of them over the past 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it is good, but I can get sick of it easily and need a break.  </li>
            <li>something you could live with every day.</li>
            <li>It stays lathered nicely as well, depending on how hard or soft your water supply is.    </li>
            <li>When comparing to other packs sold online, make sure to check the total ounces of each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this Axe scent for Christmas and although smelling it inside the bottle made me a little apprehensive to actually using it - I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>amazon are you selling me old stuff???</li>
            <li>, so far i have used up 4 bottles (what?</li>
            <li>, This is by far</li>
            <li>I am surprised that I can use a fraction of a pea-sized amount to do a body area.  </li>
            <li>At first when this first came out, i had smelt it in the store and disliked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is hard to describe, but one thing is that the smell is STRONG.  </li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if it was clearly marked as a product that was sold last year, or earlier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Think of it as that wild girlfriend of yours that you only see once in a while.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitent at first</li>

            <li> Think of it as that wild girlfriend of yours that you only see once in a while.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitent at first</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes such a long ways.  </li>
            <li> It has a long lasting scent, that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> At first, when I popped the lid to smell the gel, I thought it smelled a little too funky, and not fresh at all.</li>
            <li> Fever also has a long lasting scent, my wife loves it and said it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Not exactly an adult smell.  </li>
            <li> but that was something that i found very very very very strange!</li>
            <li> I was recently given a little like 6oz bottle or so to try.</li>
            <li> I have some trouble finding it in local stores</li>
            <li> A bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Im not a huge fan of AXE and only use 2 of their products</li>
            <li> It contains a little bit of scrubbing material -- about maybe 1/3 of that of Snake Peel if you&#x27;ve tried that product.  </li>
            <li> It has a very complex and very different smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few shower gels that linger on you and doesn&#x27;t overpower, I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments from others on the smell.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been searching all the Walmarts in town for this Fever wash, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> as is all the others, The hard part is chosing!</li>
            <li> It lathers up very thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me approximately 5 uses before a finger width sized amount was taken out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate people that layer sents, odors, and musks on themselves and think it appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this being one of them.(the rest are honestly terrible</li>
    </ol>

            <li> In the quest for the perfect shower gel, tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is kind of funky.  Not exactly an adult smell.  Reverted back to good old fashioned Dial bar or Irisih Spring bar soap.  Personal preference I guess.  Just don&#x27;t feel as clean or disenfected if you will with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This has a great citrus-like smell and seems to stick with you longer than most. It lathers up very thick. I have some trouble finding it in local stores sometimes so I&#x27;m hoping they will be keeping it on the market. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. By far my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash. It also smells really good. I like how it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Perfect smell and saves me one less item in my cart at the store!  Wish they offered more scents though.</li>
            <li> I got this Axe scent for Christmas and although smelling it inside the bottle made me a little apprehensive to actually using it - I am really glad I did. It has an amazing, unique smell that (at least for me) took some time to get use to but it is actually really pleasant. It is one of the few shower gels that linger on you and doesn&#x27;t overpower, I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments from others on the smell. It ranks up there with my favorite Axe scents (Snake peel, Kilo, Recovery ...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great product from Axe, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be for everyone. Smell before you buy on this one, for sure.</li>
            <li> so i bought this product based on all the good reviews...and i got a nice surprise when i got home. it was from last year! there was even a contest going on and it said to go online and type in this code, and next to the code there was an expiration date for the contest, and it said 12/31/2010.......uhh...its summer 2011....amazon are you selling me old stuff??? i wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if it was clearly marked as a product that was sold last year, or earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways, so far i have used up 4 bottles (what? i didn&#x27;t want to throw them away). they seem to still be good, i haven&#x27;t had any rash or anything. but that was something that i found very very very very strange!</li>
            <li> great product was a bargain and arrived on time undamaged and i will but more when i am done with useing this case i bought it leaves my skin fresh and feeling  great wonderfull product they carry other kinds in there product line i prefer this one hot brazilian mudd and grandon fruit extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingly&lt;br /&gt;T :)</li>
            <li> I have no idea anymore which AXE shower gel is my favorite, I love them all so now it depends on mood as to which I use, I love this one! I think the scent is my favorite and there are just enough little scubs in here to get you nice and clean, its alot of fun to use ! Fever also has a long lasting scent, my wife loves it and said it lasts a long time! Axe fever is a great shower gel...as is all the others, The hard part is chosing! But there so inexpensive I just have a bottle of each! Buy it, its great!</li>
            <li> As usual great product and service from Amazon.com! Bodywash smells great and I get compliments when I use it. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My favorite Body wash of all time.  Axe needs to bring it back. I&#x27;d buy it in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> This prodouct creates lots of lather, stays all day and is complimentary to a number of fragrances that I like to wear.</li>
            <li> This product has been off the shelves in Ohio and Pennsylvania for almost 3 years now it seems. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore, This is by far my favorite Body wash I have ever found. Ive tried all sorts of brands ranging from $1 brands to $25 brands and Im floored on this one. Im not a huge fan of AXE and only use 2 of their products this being one of them.(the rest are honestly terrible IMO)&lt;br /&gt;The scent is citrus and seems almost soothing. The wash beads mixed in give a nice scrubbing feel when applied by hand and the lather spreads and clings to the skin leaving an even sent throughout. It&#x27;s not over powering at all and wont have people (or yourself) cringing at an overly powered musk in the air. I honestly hate people that layer sents, odors, and musks on themselves and think it appealing.&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, for such a low price, this offer more than most. I highly recommend this wash.</li>
            <li> great stuff, love the smell.  wish it didnt go up in price.</li>
            <li> At first when this first came out, i had smelt it in the store and disliked it. The smell in the 12oz bottle was far to strong and put it for me as a big offset. I was recently given a little like 6oz bottle or so to try. I was a little hesitent at first but i gave it a go anyways. It has a very Unique smell.     In the bottle it&#x27;s strong. When you mix to a lather and put it in contact with your skin it makes a very sweet smell to it. That alone has made it one of my Top 5 AXE shower gels.    First being Recovery, Recovery, Snake Peel and BOOST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Axe shower gel. I used to buy Axe shower gel all the time, well before they started selling more exotic scents and concoctions.    Out of all of these, I would say this is my favorite. At first, when I popped the lid to smell the gel, I thought it smelled a little too funky, and not fresh at all. However, the first time I used it, and lathered it up, it smelled wonderful. It really does have a pleasant scent, that isn&#x27;t too strong or too light. In my opinion, it&#x27;s also the perfect consistency and thickness. You don&#x27;t waste much if you use a proper cloth or the Axe \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; shower tool. It&#x27;s taken me approximately 5 uses before a finger width sized amount was taken out of the bottle. It stays lathered nicely as well, depending on how hard or soft your water supply is.    All in all, a great product. A bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it. Not only does it look great, with the bright orange amidst the common dull shower walls, but it smells great, and leaves the whole shower stall smelling fresh.    I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have become somewhat of a collector of the AXE body washes, having tried almost all the different types. Having experienced the range of what AXE has to offer, Fever is without a doubt my favorite. It has a truly unique scent, which I would place somewhere between citrus and musk. It has a long lasting scent, that is not over powering. I get clean, refreshed, and smell great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, product as described.....thank you</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it. Cant find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling this and the spray in stores, thanks to Amazon I can keep using the flavor (if that is correct to describe the \\&quot;fever\\&quot; of AXE) I like best.</li>
            <li> my favorite shower gel. It has been discontinued, but I wish it was brought back</li>
            <li> Great scent and bummed Axe stopped making it.  Every woman in my life loves the stuff and I really enjoy all the looks and compliments!</li>
            <li> I like dragons and the fact of that there was multiple bottles 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</li>
            <li> We have looked for the FEVER sent in the store and can never find it....so happy to be able to order it on line.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been searching all the Walmarts in town for this Fever wash, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. This package of 6 looks like the best value per ounce. When comparing to other packs sold online, make sure to check the total ounces of each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. In a hot shower, using the soap creates an invigorating scent that I&#x27;ve always thought smells a lot like pine trees. Far superior to any other soaps I&#x27;ve used, simply because of the awesome smell during the washing.</li>
            <li> I really like this Axe shower gel, and I have tried most of them over the past 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is extremely rich and luxurious.  A tiny bit goes such a long ways.  I am surprised that I can use a fraction of a pea-sized amount to do a body area.  It contains a little bit of scrubbing material -- about maybe 1/3 of that of Snake Peel if you&#x27;ve tried that product.  It has kind of an iridescent sparkle to it.  No beads or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is hard to describe, but one thing is that the smell is STRONG.  It will fill the air, your towels, and cover YOU with it.  It is more of a polarizing smell.  To me, it is good, but I can get sick of it easily and need a break.  It is a bit feminine/perfume smelling, but then it has this tropical/exotic-smelling fruitiness to it.  Then, it has a very strong peppery overtone to it.  It has a very complex and very different smell to it.  It can overpower you, but then later you crave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an Axe fan, I would definitely recommend trying it while you can still get it.  Think of it as that wild girlfriend of yours that you only see once in a while.  Fun and memorable, but not necessarily something you could live with every day.</li>
