            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have used many diff serums.</li>
            <li>I punish my hair but I love it too.  </li>
            <li>Yet, I get so many compliments from men and women alike on my hair.  </li>
            <li>When I tell them what I use they are stumped, because they know there nothing they can sell me from the store that is better than silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and feels better when I use it.......</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s makes my hair so light and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I still love it and it will do for now</li>
            <li>I concentrated most of it on the ends and then just lightly ran my hands over the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair had a silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>just go easy</li>
            <li>Also, it smells pretty nice, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Silk drops is so light and easy to use it</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell skinny hair, Got2B smooth operator satin drops, Avon adv.</li>
            <li>If your on the fence about something that will help smooth out frizzies and increase shine</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the the higher priced ones in some salons, in fact I will not pay twice as much for a product just because it is in a salon.</li>
            <li>No matter where you live or what type hair,this stuff simply makes it feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see I can get it online, but</li>
            <li>originally used the Silk drops as a skin sealant to seal in scabies mites so the would die in my skin or pop out.</li>
            <li>and you do not need that much of it to get the job done :)</li>
            <li>Makes hair very silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>Instead, it feels soft and silky smooth, and is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes it has absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the money for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it better to put on right after I get out of the shower because it is easier to work into the hair more evenly when wet</li>
            <li>I have another brand now that soaks right into my hair which I will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and does the trick, smooths down hair</li>
            <li>It gets rid of frizz, even in hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about FX Silk Drops Serum, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>but then again, it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to do that.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>they last long smell great and really do the job!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky soft and smooth,</li>
            <li>It enables me to smooth out some of my wild areas and put into place.</li>
            <li>Silk Drops makes my hair so soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re just using it in your home, but you definitely could not travel with this product easily, as the nozzle would likely open and leak.</li>
            <li>I recently bought the FX Special Effects Silk Drops, and after only using it a week can say that I love it!  </li>
            <li>I did a search to check for its safety level on Cosmeticsdatabase.com, and I typically like to buy mostly organic and natural products, yet I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product, even though it isn&#x27;t stated as being organic or all-natural.</li>
            <li>I finally figured out how much to use, and now I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried the FX Silk Drops Serum based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li>I have longer hair than most and it has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I apply about a dime size portion to my (long) hair after blow drying and straightening it, and it removes most of the remaining frizz without making my hair look oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I use about 2 ounces or less per year, so it is very cost effective too.</li>
            <li>I like my hair to feel natural, silky, soft and yet look smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much it may make your hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much shinier, without being greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>But it was much easier ordering on-line</li>
            <li>Sometimes i like my hair straight in which case i have a straight iron for that</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very prone to frizz</li>
            <li>It made my hair greasy, even when I didn&#x27;t use a lot, and did absolutely nothing for frizz or fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>On me, it leaves my hair straight and non frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kind of &amp;#34;heavy and sticky&amp;#34; Not like the last similar product I bought Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>I have super fine thin hair that gets greasy easily</li>
            <li>, I love the fact that this product contains minimal ingredients (in comparison to other \\&quot;hair smoothers\\&quot;); its ingredients mainly appear healthy for your hair</li>
            <li>I routinely shop around for other items, but I&#x27;ve never found anything that works better than this.</li>
            <li>ok .... makes hair greasy feeling compared to other silk drops I used .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but this product was just so amazing</li>
            <li>Super cheap and the bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>BUT most times i like my natural waves minus the frizz.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my natural curls/waves!!</li>
            <li>then dry/style as normal.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my own thick, wavy hair when the weather is humid.</li>
            <li>If you live in a humid area you should give this a try.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>The first few times I applied it, I put a bit too much in my hair and it ended up feeling very oily.</li>
            <li>,.. the smell is very weak but smells good ...</li>
            <li>I am using the silk drops while I am growing out my natural hair</li>
            <li>Even hairstylists tell me it is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply too much near your forehead area, because it will look very greasy!</li>
            <li>This product may work better for coarse, thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is colored out of a box, it is tainted by numerous prescriptions including a large dosage thyroid medication (which makes hair course and dry) and though it is thick, it is extra fine, so it really takes a beating.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps when I let my hair dry naturally and use a blow dryer to get out the last bits of moisture.</li>
            <li>FX Silk Drops is light enough that my hair does not look weighed down, oily or stiff, yet it keeps the frizz under control.  </li>

            <li> FX Silk Drops is light enough that my hair does not look weighed down, oily or stiff, yet it keeps the frizz under control.  </li>
            <li> then after I&#x27;m finished I rub a small amount between my palms and smooth down my hair (like a flat iron but with my hands) or if I am going to scrunch it</li>
            <li> It is a nice thin formula and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It really works and with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair daily, but it ends up dry and frizzy, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It is a lightweight serum that keeps my natural hair shiny and manageable without the weighed down, greasy feel of some thicker serums.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly red hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle itself is not designed very well</li>
            <li> even when used wet or dry, and it only take a tiny amount so one bottle will last FOREVER.</li>
            <li> blow dry and/or flat iron)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend starting at the ends &amp; then using what&#x27;s left-over in your hands to go over the other parts of your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toddler daughter&#x27;s curly hair after washing to help it dry without frizzing and it works every time.</li>
            <li> I apply it to slighty towel-dried, shower wet hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> However, when you use it, you should only get a pea size amount atleast for thin to normal hair.</li>
            <li> It is very dry and frizzes if I don&#x27;t use some sort of hair dressing.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a few curling gels/creams of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet hair</li>
            <li> This product was too heavy and left my hair looking and feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to put a lot in your Hair because it will make your Hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It tends to snap off when it&#x27;s wet and for someone who is trying to grow their hair out</li>
            <li> but if you only use a little bit on wet hair concentrating on the ends it shouldn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have always had really dry, curly, black hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Always remember to start applying in the BACK of your head and at the ENDS of your hair, the dry, thick spots of your head.</li>
            <li> This did not exactly \\&quot;tame\\&quot; fly-aways,</li>
            <li> After I shampoo, I apply about the size of a nickel into my hand, then I rub it into the other and run my fingers through my hair.  </li>

            <li> My hair is prone to split ends and tangling due to the amount of times I dye it.</li>
            <li> It does help control the frizzes but be careful because it just takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> Use just as little on your wet hair after you&#x27;ve shampoo and conditioned your hair,</li>
            <li> I use a little before I blow dry my hair, and sometimes a little after straightening my hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this hair product.  A little goes a long way.  I will continue to use this for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use smoothing serums a lot. I bought this and a few curling gels/creams of the same brand. I was very disappointed with the other products from this brand, but this one I was pleasantly surprised. Smells good and does the trick, smooths down hair and you do not need that much of it to get the job done :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes hair very silky and smooth! Love it</li>
            <li> I use this on my toddler daughter&#x27;s curly hair after washing to help it dry without frizzing and it works every time. I also use it on my own thick, wavy hair when the weather is humid. It is a nice thin formula and a little bit goes a long way. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone saying that this makes your hair greasy. I have used other brands and they are all too thick, making it very difficult not to get a greasy finish, but never with this product. Always remember to start applying in the BACK of your head and at the ENDS of your hair, the dry, thick spots of your head. NEVER in the front - it will look greasy if you do that.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly red hair.  It is very dry and frizzes if I don&#x27;t use some sort of hair dressing. I like my hair to feel natural, silky, soft and yet look smooth and not frizzy.  FX Silk Drops is light enough that my hair does not look weighed down, oily or stiff, yet it keeps the frizz under control.  It really works and with very little effort on my part.  I apply it to slighty towel-dried, shower wet hair and let it air dry. good to go.</li>
            <li> I just bought a 4-ounce bottle today and haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  The stars are for the price.  My grocery store&#x27;s regular price for this size is $4.24.  Why is yours so expensive?</li>
            <li> I tried the FX Silk Drops Serum based on the positive reviews and I have to agree it does what everyone says it will do.  I have color treated hair and it often has lots of tangles.  I smoothed this stuff on before drying and I have no tangles even a day later.  It also made my hair very soft and shiny.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry on the ends like it usually does and it also smoothed all the split ends and kept it frizz-free.  The key is to just use a very small amount.  A little goes a long way.  If you use too much it may make your hair too greasy.  I concentrated most of it on the ends and then just lightly ran my hands over the rest of my hair.  It works great and is very reasonably priced.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft! Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not the best hair serum</li>
            <li> It gets rid of frizz, even in hot and humid weather. I routinely shop around for other items, but I&#x27;ve never found anything that works better than this.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the FX Special Effects Silk Drops, and after only using it a week can say that I love it!  My hair looks much shinier, without being greasy at all.  I use a little before I blow dry my hair, and sometimes a little after straightening my hair.  My hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair daily, but it ends up dry and frizzy, especially during the winter months. I&#x27;ve used a few products that helped me manage my hair (pomades, gels, etc.), but they usually tend to weigh down my hair, or leave it feeling dirty. When I first heard about FX Silk Drops Serum, I had to give it a try. Why not? I&#x27;ve tried everything else. The first few times I applied it, I put a bit too much in my hair and it ended up feeling very oily. I finally figured out how much to use, and now I love it. After I wash my hair, I put a tiny amount - about the volume of a pea - into my hands and spread it through my hair. After a couple of minutes it has absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Instead, it feels soft and silky smooth, and is much more manageable. I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product for my natural hairdo..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this is NOT the same product they sold in stores. I use to buy this all the time at my drug store, then couldn&#x27;t get it anymore so I was excited to see I can get it online, but im very disappointed the product makes hair oily, no shine AT ALL.</li>
            <li> After I showered, i smoothed a few drops onto my hair.  After it dried, there was a almost no frizz (All of you know that a product can&#x27;t take all the fizz out) and my hair was left glossed.  Most importantly, my hair had a silky feeling.  I have always had really dry, curly, black hair.  I can&#x27;t even tell you the number of products I have used for it that have failed to do what they promised to do. I will diffidently be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I tried this on the ends of my hair, which are prone to dryness. This immediately smoothed out my hair and made it look shiny and glossy. But use very little, otherwise it could make your hair look greasy. I&#x27;d recommend starting at the ends &amp; then using what&#x27;s left-over in your hands to go over the other parts of your hair. Be careful not to apply too much near your forehead area, because it will look very greasy! This did not exactly \\&quot;tame\\&quot; fly-aways, but then again, it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to do that. It smooths the hair and makes it look shiny. Also, it smells pretty nice, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the fact that this product contains minimal ingredients (in comparison to other \\&quot;hair smoothers\\&quot;); its ingredients mainly appear healthy for your hair (Vitamin E, Vitamin B5, Vitamin A). I did a search to check for its safety level on Cosmeticsdatabase.com, and I typically like to buy mostly organic and natural products, yet I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product, even though it isn&#x27;t stated as being organic or all-natural.</li>
            <li> Very nice!!!! 5 star very nice!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use to buy this at my local Walmart, but they stopped selling it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com. This is the best shine product on the market. It&#x27;s great at stopping frizzies. However, when you use it, you should only get a pea size amount atleast for thin to normal hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it once i get out of the shower. It keeps my hair really smooth and soft. I also use it for my little girls.</li>
            <li> works ok .... makes hair greasy feeling compared to other silk drops I used .,.. the smell is very weak but smells good ... it seems as though when I use this I have a terrible hair day so I no longer use them .... I recommend designline silkdrops they work awesome no heavy feeling ... they are usually at hair salons for 8 $ they last long smell great and really do the job!</li>
            <li> When local stores in my area stopped caring Silk Drops I checked Amazon and Wa La I ordered 4 bottles.  Later I noticed it showed up on the shelves of a couple local stores, must have been a supply problem. But it was much easier ordering on-line and i&#x27;ll do it again, next time</li>
            <li> great shine and frizz ease!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but this product was just so amazing i had to do it. Now i bought mine at Walmart. I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair that can be just out of control.  Sometimes i like my hair straight in which case i have a straight iron for that BUT most times i like my natural waves minus the frizz.  I&#x27;ve tried numerious products that claim to help tame frizz but they always leave my hair oily or feeling heavy. Silk drops is so light and easy to use it takes the frizz away without making my hair look like its been weeks since its been washed!! and it leaves my natural curls/waves!! I will be using this product from now on!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using FX silk drops for about a year now. I absolutely love it. Super cheap and the bottle will last you a long time. I hardly notice any split ends anymore. Way better than any expensive split end mending product. I have super fine thin hair that gets greasy easily but if you only use a little bit on wet hair concentrating on the ends it shouldn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it greasy. Defiantly going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years, then my store discontinued it. So happy to find it on Amazon. It is a lightweight serum that keeps my natural hair shiny and manageable without the weighed down, greasy feel of some thicker serums. I have coarse, thick hair that I&#x27;ve relaxed for decades. I am using the silk drops while I am growing out my natural hair and it really helps when I let my hair dry naturally and use a blow dryer to get out the last bits of moisture.</li>
            <li> I have used many diff serums. Paul Mitchell skinny hair, Got2B smooth operator satin drops, Avon adv. tech. Skinny hair serum, Garnier Fructis sleek Anti Frizz Serum Sleek and Shine, and Silk FX Lotus serum. Of these I would repurchase in this order Avon Adv. Tech(no longer avail),Silk FX Drops(NOT THE LOTUS)Garnier Fructis Anti Frizz Sleek and Shine. I put it on wet hair I may style (blow dry and/or flat iron) then after I&#x27;m finished I rub a small amount between my palms and smooth down my hair (like a flat iron but with my hands) or if I am going to scrunch it I combine the serum w/ a mousse rub through and scrunch. I try to always have this on hand and can almost always find it in Walmart. If your on the fence about something that will help smooth out frizzies and increase shine then you should consider starting with this b/c for the price and what it has done for me I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that leaves a nice shine, not oily finish to your hair. I&#x27;ll be reordering this!</li>
            <li> I punish my hair but I love it too.  It is colored out of a box, it is tainted by numerous prescriptions including a large dosage thyroid medication (which makes hair course and dry) and though it is thick, it is extra fine, so it really takes a beating.  Yet, I get so many compliments from men and women alike on my hair.  Even hairstylists tell me it is soft and shiny.  When I tell them what I use they are stumped, because they know there nothing they can sell me from the store that is better than silk.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use.  After I shampoo, I apply about the size of a nickel into my hand, then I rub it into the other and run my fingers through my hair.  Then I comb it. I use about 2 ounces or less per year, so it is very cost effective too.</li>
            <li> It does help control the frizzes but be careful because it just takes a little bit. I&#x27;ve found it better to put on right after I get out of the shower because it is easier to work into the hair more evenly when wet but that&#x27;s probably a personal preference. I have longer hair than most and it has lasted a long time. If you live in a humid area you should give this a try. No matter where you live or what type hair,this stuff simply makes it feel wonderful. I can tell when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. It looks and feels better when I use it.......just go easy, I have thick long hair and I pour less than a quarter size \\&quot;drop\\&quot; in my palm. Try a dime size drop to begin with and work it in.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great - I apply about a dime size portion to my (long) hair after blow drying and straightening it, and it removes most of the remaining frizz without making my hair look oily at all.  It also has a very nice sweet perfume-like smell.  My only complaint is that the bottle itself is not designed very well - it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re just using it in your home, but you definitely could not travel with this product easily, as the nozzle would likely open and leak.</li>
            <li> I have to use anti-frizz on my hair.  This product was too heavy and left my hair looking and feeling greasy.  I have another brand now that soaks right into my hair which I will continue to use.  This product may work better for coarse, thick curly hair.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It makes my hair silky soft and smooth, even when used wet or dry, and it only take a tiny amount so one bottle will last FOREVER. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Kind of &amp;#34;heavy and sticky&amp;#34; Not like the last similar product I bought Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that&#x27;s very prone to frizz so after this being recommended to me, I thought I&#x27;d try it. I was disappointed. It made my hair greasy, even when I didn&#x27;t use a lot, and did absolutely nothing for frizz or fly-aways. A total waste of my money. It&#x27;s the same story with the FX Curls Up curl activator too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I bougth it for a friend and she would recommend it over and over.</li>
            <li> It only takes 2 or 3 drops to make your hair silky and shiney.My daughter bought me some several years ago.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and I used to buy it from Walgreens and they don&#x27;t sell it anymore then I find it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s worth the money for it and I am so addict to it and it&#x27;s makes my hair so light and shiny!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Even though I was sent the one in the gray instead of the purple ..I still love it and it will do for now</li>
            <li> product is great glad i could still find on amazon.</li>
            <li> These drops feel great on my hair! I used to by this at my local store and then they stopped selling it so I had to search other places. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found it anywhere and its a great amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Helpful to get a nice gleam to your hair.  Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my curly hair shiny and non-kinky!</li>
            <li> silk drops are perfect for my hair.  It enables me to smooth out some of my wild areas and put into place.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way. Have to be careful not to put a lot in your Hair because it will make your Hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is prone to split ends and tangling due to the amount of times I dye it. I thought after this last dying session my hair would be fried. It tends to snap off when it&#x27;s wet and for someone who is trying to grow their hair out it is heartbreaking. Silk Drops makes my hair so soft and tangle free. I also haven&#x27;t seen any split ends since I started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with VO5 Leave in Conditioner spray. If it doesn&#x27;t work alone (which I doubt because I have used it alone) then try it with some sort of leave in conditioner spray.</li>
            <li> This works great for curly hair.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  Just put it in your hair when it is damp.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the the higher priced ones in some salons, in fact I will not pay twice as much for a product just because it is in a salon.</li>
            <li> If you like and use Biosilk you will find this product is almost the same except for the price and the scent.The scent is nice. Use just as little on your wet hair after you&#x27;ve shampoo and conditioned your hair, then dry/style as normal. On me, it leaves my hair straight and non frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I originally used the Silk drops as a skin sealant to seal in scabies mites so the would die in my skin or pop out. It&#x27;s a nice non pesticide treatment and cheaper rather than the RX Permethrin cream treatment. It achieves the same results without the poison.</li>
