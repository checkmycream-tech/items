            <li>Im very happy.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Infusion Shine products because they&#x27;re absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best if I use a detangling comb and comb the conditioner through my hair in the shower while I wait the 2-3 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>I used this with the moroccan oil style by Suave and was really impressed with the end result.</li>
            <li>I know longer have frizz or fly aways!</li>
            <li>and it feels just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is incredible and paired with the shampoo</li>
            <li>I read a review about best shampoos for a good price.  </li>

            <li>it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Smells great though.</li>
            <li>the problem was it irritated my eyes greatly.</li>
            <li>so for some, it might be a great shampoo, but not for me..</li>
            <li>It smells great, too.</li>
            <li>in mind I do NOT use the SPMI shampoo, which might be why I haven&#x27;t experienced any greasy buildup of the product.</li>
            <li>I was happy to realize, after using the combination, that this didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>both smell really, really great.</li>

            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>While it might not be the best conditioner out there, we are very happy with it and think it offers a good value....unless you factor in the water bill.</li>

            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I used the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner (28 oz) after washing my hair with Suave&#x27;s Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo bottle opens from the top, and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom.</li>
            <li>After drying my hair, I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite shampoos/conditioner brands make my hair look, Pantene Ice Shine.</li>
            <li>also love the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care formula.</li>
            <li>also love the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care formula.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner</li>
            <li>I love everything else about the conditioner though, so I am going to continue to use it and hope that my hair adapts to it.</li>
            <li>I think for most women this will be a plus side of using it.</li>
            <li>Great detangling capabilities and my hair was nice and soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li>really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise</li>
            <li>really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this line by suave.</li>
            <li>Their hair is more shiny and manageable with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent &amp; she does too.  </li>
            <li>You should use it in conjunction with the shampoo for better results.</li>
            <li>I used that before getting this and found that it has a bit more softening power.</li>
            <li>I have to say that my hair does look more shiny than ever before</li>
            <li>I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using this.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my daughters hair in the hopes that it would help her not have so many knots in her hair....</li>
            <li>The kids love it, too.</li>
            <li>Love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li>The feeling of my hair is luxurious, soft well behaved, super shine, smells so good!!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a no brainer, especially when it smells amazing and works great</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a no brainer, especially when it smells amazing and works great</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>it makes ur hair easy manageable</li>
            <li>My hair was detangled and I could comb it easily once I was out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To get great results make sure to use this conditioner with the same brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean and a bit exotic.  </li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as the high end shampoos and conditioners (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  </li>
            <li>I love the sweet, savory, nutty scent.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice shine, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice soft clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>all conditioners this is used up much more quickly than shampoos</li>
            <li>They are pretty good together as a set, surprisingly, W]with only one flaw, which I will get to..</li>
            <li>So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use, the shampoo and conditioner do work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Moroccan Infusion line is a great step in Suave&#x27;s product selection and offers a new and inventive product that will please many.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price: $6.29&lt;br /&gt;Price: $4.98 &amp; FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members when buying this Add-on Item.</li>
            <li>item is available because of the Add-on program</li>
            <li>After I wash this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t feel smooth for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves our hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and reminded me of the was</li>
            <li>It does a great job of giving her dark hair a beautiful shine and soft texture.  </li>
            <li>You can actually smell it throughout the house when she showers, lol.  </li>
            <li>The oil content was a bit too much for my liking, but I think many people will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have to say, all are great products and work as promised, leaving hair clean, smooth, with less frizzies and more life.  </li>
            <li>Anyway there are many articles on the internet about &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; if anyone is interested.</li>
            <li>Using Suave Moroccan Infusion, my hair will still hold a curl and feels richly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightly musky but sweet</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like a nice new hair aroma, try this stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a local department store and let me say its by far the best shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s by far the most interesting conditioner fragrance I&#x27;ve ever come</li>
            <li>This conditioner is worthy for it&#x27;s price but doesn&#x27;t offer more than the good conditioning of any other Suave conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair looked great the first day, but greasy the next.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner for a reasonably priced one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t used Suave products in a bout 20 years, so I was a bit surprised at the quality here and that I actually liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>but I discovered that the conditioner lasted two full days in terms of controlling flyaway and puffy hair post brushing.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and provides plenty of moisture for their thick, semi-coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes your hair smooth and your hair smells good when it is dry.</li>
            <li>The scent is of cheap spicy perfume and is strong and really nauseating.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>I find this product to work best if you actually allow it to sit in your hair for ten minutes after using the suave conditioner!</li>
            <li>and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly</li>
            <li>and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly</li>
            <li>I love the combination of the two together - I feel as if I am getting a better infusion if I am both shampooing and conditioning with the same.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine.</li>
            <li>Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very mild scent, that&#x27;s also unusual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong, noticeable scent that does not dissipate much during the day.</li>
            <li>love the scent to it and it makes my hair super silky soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have very thick hair, and this shampoo and conditioner is perfect.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner has a very strong but inoffensive odor, earthy and sweet at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I have been using this conditioning product every time I wash my hair and it leaves my hair pretty soft with a pleasant fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that I find a perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this conditioner (and the shampoo)  I live in Florida and when I&#x27;m not biking in the hot sun, dipping my hair in a chlorine pool or swimming in salt water, then maybe I&#x27;m caring for my hair.  </li>
            <li>set of shampoo &amp; conditioner would be great for someone who needs control, someone who needs to tame their hair.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels rich and creamy, like  something only the wealthy could afford.  </li>
            <li>I normally always use the Ice Shine, but it&#x27;s pricey and has a really strong overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have used almost all of Suave products and this one right here, hits the mark!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I  logged on to Amazon right away and bought the shampoo and conditioner right away.  </li>
            <li>Price was right, not too perfumey</li>
            <li>But the bottle is going right into the trash.</li>
            <li>Conditions decent, not too cheap but not up there for me with Pantene or Aussie.</li>
            <li>Even though I liked this product I would rather use the Suave conditioning masque rather than this because the masque seems to penetrate the scalp more especially while deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Both the Shampoo and the Conditioner are infused with authentic Moroccan argan oil, a lightweight miracle oil that absorbs instantly and is known to give brilliant shine and long lasting conditioning benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it for someone with a similiar hair type or for someone who loves a richly scented shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but am very happy.</li>
            <li>The shine conditioner went on smoothly and left hair feeling smooth and</li>
            <li>Not very thick, but otherwise a fine conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to strong smells and perfume.</li>
            <li>I can only use it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li>After using a free sample, I couldn&#x27;t find a full size bottle locally - so Amazon, ship to the boonies!  </li>
            <li>Both shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used higher end shampoo and conditioner from Kerastase and Pureology with Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li>Love getting it in the larger bottles for this family of 6!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27; put two and two together at first..</li>
            <li>My sister has more oily hair and tried it and felt that it left her hair shiny, but oily too.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well!  </li>
            <li>My hair, which has a lot of frizz, was smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner as a system, and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love the musky, yet feminine scent of Suave&#x27;s entire Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li>and it was WAY too much!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Suave product and recommend it to anyone with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product I bought the whole line ( Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Styling oil )for my personal use and endup buying it for friends and family.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m at a point where I use a very small amount of this conditioner and am getting great results.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product as a good alternative to the more expensive conditioners with Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, dry, frizzy hair and this shampoo works wonders!</li>
            <li>It may be due to the fact that I am using all 3 products in the same line that my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>More of a soap or mild perfume smell, than the typical citrus or floral</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very thick or rich, but surprisingly it did work very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any special shine or glow or magical elves on carpets wafting behind me after using this, but I did notice a very unique smell, much like the classic Indian incense Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer my normal brands, but this is okay for shine</li>
            <li>conditioner is great for average hair and daily use.</li>
            <li>It certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the fact that I have healthy hair (not permed, dyed, or blown dry) has something to do with the fact that it didn&#x27;t do much to help my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, blonde, and fine.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Now it is put in with this shampoo and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>and it works out really well.</li>
            <li>My hair is not oily by nature, so this conditioner works very well in it.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use much at all.</li>
            <li>(Before I washed my hair again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li>It feels so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the Suave brand of hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse/thick hair</li>
            <li>but this is reasonable for the results.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, but my daughter has curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Much like their shampoo, the scent wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and did not linger too much after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>This time, Suave really outdid itself.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of Suave&#x27;s products, but the Moroccan Infusion line has won me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a fabulously Moroccan spicy scent, which lingers and it is totally relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want a scent that is noticeable but not too much.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used what I would consider a normal amount for Suave conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, nothing special, more chemicals and less natural ingredients than I prefer, but once a week</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, not overpowering but strong enough to linger a little while after your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>This means it is very cost effective and the bottle will last a while, even with really long hair.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have baby fine, long, wavy hair, which has highlights and lowlights and the ends of my hair tend to get dryed out.</li>
            <li>I really like this whole new line by Suave.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this Suave brand and will most likely stick with it, at least for now anyway.</li>
            <li>This may be due to the Moroccan argan oil or just because my hair is better conditioned overall, but the end result is that my hair definitely has more shine to it.</li>
            <li>I also love is that this conditioner helps my dry ends, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the rest of my fine</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most shine shampoos.</li>
            <li>or so I use this, mainly for my honey&#x27;s benefit, as she loves the smell and noticed it immediately.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner gives you high quality at a drugstore price.</li>
            <li>At the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of them - they have a nice clean smell and work as promised.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and makes it so much easier to detangle.  </li>
            <li>it normally helps my hair</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and makes my hair feel soft and healthy, but it&#x27;s a little heavier than other conditioners and therefore leaves my hair feeling a little heavier.</li>
            <li>I had to use clarifying shampoo to get my hair to feel normal again.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on my hair</li>
            <li>In addition, enjoying outdoor activities often, the sun can prove harsh to my hair in the summer time.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long, and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>and it did make my fine, limp hair feel nice, soft and even give a little bit of sheen..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if I am planning on straightening my hair, but I can&#x27;t live with the limpness on an everyday basis, when I want my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave your hair super soft</li>
            <li>I really liked this product when I first starting using it but after daily use for a few weeks I really didn&#x27;t like how it was changing the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.t mind losing her waves a bit.</li>
            <li>It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.</li>
            <li>the longer I use these new Suave Moroccan products,</li>
            <li>They are not super girly smelling though, so a man can use them easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the conditioner leaves my hair very soft but with bounce.  </li>
            <li>well, it helps a lot and leaves the her hair very soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair wonderfully soft!</li>
            <li>This is the first line by suave that I actually like.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it and the way it lingers thru the day but not overwhelmingly.</li>
            <li>the more they start making my hair flyaway looking, just like the usual Suave products.  </li>
            <li>My usual and favorite shampoo is [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>It added just a small healthy sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I comb the conditioner through and let it soak into my wet hair while in the shower to get the full benefit of the moisturizing elements.  </li>
            <li>The smell is little strong but is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair were pretty dry and dead before but this makes them look a lot better.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a sweet scent that&#x27;s unlike any other hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>And the next day my hair holds the style better than before, so I wash it less</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it was coated in some kind of waxy substance, dry, and just limp.</li>
            <li>If you wash everyday, perhaps this conditioner would work for you, but probably not if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, has shine and body.</li>
            <li>far I have been using this conditioner to wash my hair for over a week</li>
            <li>shine and soft</li>
            <li>I was so surprised</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, pass this one up.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at this.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiney and soft.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>Both of our hair is really soft and manageable after we use this.  </li>
            <li>I use chemicals in my hair about four times a year between keratin treatment and professional coloring.  </li>
            <li>Dullness and brittle ends set in mid-autumn and by the early winter</li>
            <li>It does noticeably condition the hair, making it smooth and shiny but without leaving a heavy residue and making it easier to style.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a shine that lasts all day without weighing down hair.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned, probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone.</li>
            <li>Seriously, why pay more??</li>
            <li>This is an effective product at less than half the price of salon products!  </li>
            <li>After using them on my hair, the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet.</li>
            <li>She says that many of the fancier and considerably more expensive products on the market just seem too harsh either on her hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair that I usually straighten on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>My hair becomes particularly dry during winter and this conditioner has helped more than my usual.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area, so new products take a long time to get here.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and am always on the look out for deep conditioning products that can keep the ends well nourished.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get shampoo in my eyes directly, but I think the residue in rinse water or left on hair itself..</li>
            <li>Like most other hair products that contain oils, I found rinsing to be a more difficult, although that might be due to my water type as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a strong fake perfume smell and doesn&#x27;t really ad much shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells like baby powder and other really relaxing scents</li>
            <li>Other reviewers mention the unusual fragrance but the scent didn&#x27;t stand out to me.</li>
            <li>noticed subtle added shine from the first use, mainly on my highlights.</li>
            <li>However, at the same time, I didn&#x27;t really feel like there was any difference between using this and the other Suave Shampoo and conditioners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really seems to be no different than the other Moroccan conditioner.  </li>
            <li>After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently.</li>
            <li>Even though this is more expensive that many of the other Suave conditioning products, I will definitely be buying it again because a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo 28 oz]] has a heavenly scent, which lasts on my hair all day if I let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>With this Suave, I didn&#x27;t need a whole lot - actually needed a lot less than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Not extra good, nothing bad, just shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner (28 oz) after washing my hair with Suave&#x27;s Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo bottle opens from the top, and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair, I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt.</li>

            <li> I love everything else about the conditioner though, so I am going to continue to use it and hope that my hair adapts to it.</li>
            <li> I think for most women this will be a plus side of using it.</li>
            <li> Great detangling capabilities and my hair was nice and soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li> really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise</li>
            <li> really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this line by suave.</li>
            <li> Their hair is more shiny and manageable with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent &amp; she does too.  </li>
            <li> You should use it in conjunction with the shampoo for better results.</li>
            <li> I used that before getting this and found that it has a bit more softening power.</li>
            <li> I have to say that my hair does look more shiny than ever before</li>
            <li> I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using this.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my daughters hair in the hopes that it would help her not have so many knots in her hair....</li>

            <li> - it&#x27;s a no brainer, especially when it smells amazing and works great</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> it makes ur hair easy manageable</li>
            <li> My hair was detangled and I could comb it easily once I was out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To get great results make sure to use this conditioner with the same brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean and a bit exotic.  </li>
            <li> It is every bit as good as the high end shampoos and conditioners (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  </li>
            <li> I love the sweet, savory, nutty scent.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a nice shine, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice soft clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> all conditioners this is used up much more quickly than shampoos</li>
            <li> They are pretty good together as a set, surprisingly, W]with only one flaw, which I will get to..</li>
            <li> So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use, the shampoo and conditioner do work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Moroccan Infusion line is a great step in Suave&#x27;s product selection and offers a new and inventive product that will please many.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> After I wash this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t feel smooth for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves our hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and reminded me of the was</li>
            <li> It does a great job of giving her dark hair a beautiful shine and soft texture.  </li>
            <li> You can actually smell it throughout the house when she showers, lol.  </li>
            <li> The oil content was a bit too much for my liking, but I think many people will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have to say, all are great products and work as promised, leaving hair clean, smooth, with less frizzies and more life.  </li>
            <li> Anyway there are many articles on the internet about &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; if anyone is interested.</li>
            <li> Using Suave Moroccan Infusion, my hair will still hold a curl and feels richly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightly musky but sweet</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like a nice new hair aroma, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local department store and let me say its by far the best shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s by far the most interesting conditioner fragrance I&#x27;ve ever come</li>
            <li> This conditioner is worthy for it&#x27;s price but doesn&#x27;t offer more than the good conditioning of any other Suave conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair looked great the first day, but greasy the next.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner for a reasonably priced one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t used Suave products in a bout 20 years, so I was a bit surprised at the quality here and that I actually liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> but I discovered that the conditioner lasted two full days in terms of controlling flyaway and puffy hair post brushing.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and provides plenty of moisture for their thick, semi-coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair smooth and your hair smells good when it is dry.</li>
            <li> The scent is of cheap spicy perfume and is strong and really nauseating.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> I find this product to work best if you actually allow it to sit in your hair for ten minutes after using the suave conditioner!</li>
            <li> and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly</li>
            <li> and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly</li>
            <li> I love the combination of the two together - I feel as if I am getting a better infusion if I am both shampooing and conditioning with the same.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine.</li>
            <li> Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very mild scent, that&#x27;s also unusual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong, noticeable scent that does not dissipate much during the day.</li>
            <li> love the scent to it and it makes my hair super silky soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very thick hair, and this shampoo and conditioner is perfect.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner has a very strong but inoffensive odor, earthy and sweet at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I have been using this conditioning product every time I wash my hair and it leaves my hair pretty soft with a pleasant fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I find a perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this conditioner (and the shampoo)  I live in Florida and when I&#x27;m not biking in the hot sun, dipping my hair in a chlorine pool or swimming in salt water, then maybe I&#x27;m caring for my hair.  </li>
            <li> set of shampoo &amp; conditioner would be great for someone who needs control, someone who needs to tame their hair.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels rich and creamy, like  something only the wealthy could afford.  </li>
            <li> I normally always use the Ice Shine, but it&#x27;s pricey and has a really strong overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used almost all of Suave products and this one right here, hits the mark!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I  logged on to Amazon right away and bought the shampoo and conditioner right away.  </li>
            <li> Price was right, not too perfumey</li>
            <li> But the bottle is going right into the trash.</li>
            <li> Conditions decent, not too cheap but not up there for me with Pantene or Aussie.</li>
            <li> Even though I liked this product I would rather use the Suave conditioning masque rather than this because the masque seems to penetrate the scalp more especially while deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Both the Shampoo and the Conditioner are infused with authentic Moroccan argan oil, a lightweight miracle oil that absorbs instantly and is known to give brilliant shine and long lasting conditioning benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it for someone with a similiar hair type or for someone who loves a richly scented shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but am very happy.</li>
            <li> The shine conditioner went on smoothly and left hair feeling smooth and</li>
            <li> Not very thick, but otherwise a fine conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to strong smells and perfume.</li>
            <li> I can only use it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li> After using a free sample, I couldn&#x27;t find a full size bottle locally - so Amazon, ship to the boonies!  </li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used higher end shampoo and conditioner from Kerastase and Pureology with Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> Love getting it in the larger bottles for this family of 6!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27; put two and two together at first..</li>
            <li> My sister has more oily hair and tried it and felt that it left her hair shiny, but oily too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well!  </li>
            <li> My hair, which has a lot of frizz, was smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner as a system, and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love the musky, yet feminine scent of Suave&#x27;s entire Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li> and it was WAY too much!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Suave product and recommend it to anyone with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product I bought the whole line ( Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Styling oil )for my personal use and endup buying it for friends and family.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m at a point where I use a very small amount of this conditioner and am getting great results.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product as a good alternative to the more expensive conditioners with Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry, frizzy hair and this shampoo works wonders!</li>
            <li> It may be due to the fact that I am using all 3 products in the same line that my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li> More of a soap or mild perfume smell, than the typical citrus or floral</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very thick or rich, but surprisingly it did work very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any special shine or glow or magical elves on carpets wafting behind me after using this, but I did notice a very unique smell, much like the classic Indian incense Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer my normal brands, but this is okay for shine</li>
            <li> conditioner is great for average hair and daily use.</li>
            <li> It certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the fact that I have healthy hair (not permed, dyed, or blown dry) has something to do with the fact that it didn&#x27;t do much to help my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, blonde, and fine.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Now it is put in with this shampoo and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> and it works out really well.</li>
            <li> My hair is not oily by nature, so this conditioner works very well in it.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use much at all.</li>
            <li> (Before I washed my hair again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> It feels so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the Suave brand of hair care products.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse/thick hair</li>
            <li> but this is reasonable for the results.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, but my daughter has curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Much like their shampoo, the scent wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and did not linger too much after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> This time, Suave really outdid itself.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of Suave&#x27;s products, but the Moroccan Infusion line has won me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a fabulously Moroccan spicy scent, which lingers and it is totally relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want a scent that is noticeable but not too much.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used what I would consider a normal amount for Suave conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, nothing special, more chemicals and less natural ingredients than I prefer, but once a week</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, not overpowering but strong enough to linger a little while after your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> This means it is very cost effective and the bottle will last a while, even with really long hair.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, wavy hair, which has highlights and lowlights and the ends of my hair tend to get dryed out.</li>
            <li> I really like this whole new line by Suave.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this Suave brand and will most likely stick with it, at least for now anyway.</li>
            <li> This may be due to the Moroccan argan oil or just because my hair is better conditioned overall, but the end result is that my hair definitely has more shine to it.</li>
            <li> I also love is that this conditioner helps my dry ends, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the rest of my fine</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most shine shampoos.</li>
            <li> or so I use this, mainly for my honey&#x27;s benefit, as she loves the smell and noticed it immediately.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner gives you high quality at a drugstore price.</li>
            <li> At the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of them - they have a nice clean smell and work as promised.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and makes it so much easier to detangle.  </li>
            <li> it normally helps my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and makes my hair feel soft and healthy, but it&#x27;s a little heavier than other conditioners and therefore leaves my hair feeling a little heavier.</li>
            <li> I had to use clarifying shampoo to get my hair to feel normal again.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on my hair</li>
            <li> In addition, enjoying outdoor activities often, the sun can prove harsh to my hair in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long, and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> and it did make my fine, limp hair feel nice, soft and even give a little bit of sheen..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if I am planning on straightening my hair, but I can&#x27;t live with the limpness on an everyday basis, when I want my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave your hair super soft</li>
            <li> I really liked this product when I first starting using it but after daily use for a few weeks I really didn&#x27;t like how it was changing the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.t mind losing her waves a bit.</li>
            <li> It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.</li>
            <li> the longer I use these new Suave Moroccan products,</li>
            <li> They are not super girly smelling though, so a man can use them easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the conditioner leaves my hair very soft but with bounce.  </li>
            <li> well, it helps a lot and leaves the her hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair wonderfully soft!</li>
            <li> This is the first line by suave that I actually like.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it and the way it lingers thru the day but not overwhelmingly.</li>
            <li> the more they start making my hair flyaway looking, just like the usual Suave products.  </li>
            <li> My usual and favorite shampoo is [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> It added just a small healthy sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I comb the conditioner through and let it soak into my wet hair while in the shower to get the full benefit of the moisturizing elements.  </li>
            <li> The smell is little strong but is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were pretty dry and dead before but this makes them look a lot better.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a sweet scent that&#x27;s unlike any other hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And the next day my hair holds the style better than before, so I wash it less</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it was coated in some kind of waxy substance, dry, and just limp.</li>
            <li> If you wash everyday, perhaps this conditioner would work for you, but probably not if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, has shine and body.</li>
            <li> far I have been using this conditioner to wash my hair for over a week</li>
            <li> shine and soft</li>
            <li> I was so surprised</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, pass this one up.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at this.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Both of our hair is really soft and manageable after we use this.  </li>
            <li> I use chemicals in my hair about four times a year between keratin treatment and professional coloring.  </li>
            <li> Dullness and brittle ends set in mid-autumn and by the early winter</li>
            <li> It does noticeably condition the hair, making it smooth and shiny but without leaving a heavy residue and making it easier to style.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a shine that lasts all day without weighing down hair.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned, probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone.</li>
            <li> Seriously, why pay more??</li>
            <li> This is an effective product at less than half the price of salon products!  </li>
            <li> After using them on my hair, the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet.</li>
            <li> She says that many of the fancier and considerably more expensive products on the market just seem too harsh either on her hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair that I usually straighten on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> My hair becomes particularly dry during winter and this conditioner has helped more than my usual.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area, so new products take a long time to get here.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and am always on the look out for deep conditioning products that can keep the ends well nourished.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get shampoo in my eyes directly, but I think the residue in rinse water or left on hair itself..</li>
            <li> Like most other hair products that contain oils, I found rinsing to be a more difficult, although that might be due to my water type as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a strong fake perfume smell and doesn&#x27;t really ad much shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like baby powder and other really relaxing scents</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mention the unusual fragrance but the scent didn&#x27;t stand out to me.</li>
            <li> noticed subtle added shine from the first use, mainly on my highlights.</li>
            <li> However, at the same time, I didn&#x27;t really feel like there was any difference between using this and the other Suave Shampoo and conditioners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really seems to be no different than the other Moroccan conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently.</li>
            <li> Even though this is more expensive that many of the other Suave conditioning products, I will definitely be buying it again because a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo 28 oz]] has a heavenly scent, which lasts on my hair all day if I let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> With this Suave, I didn&#x27;t need a whole lot - actually needed a lot less than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Not extra good, nothing bad, just shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The overall shine left when I blow dry</li>
            <li> so my hair is often frizzy) and I can only wash my hair twice a week because it is on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> My last conditioner made my hair feel dry after I used it.</li>
            <li> If you have harder to manage hair, frizzy hair or damaged hair, I would definitely recommend using Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask instead.</li>
            <li> If not, I highly recommend it due to how soft my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the matching shampoo makes my hair as soft and silky as it usually is after a deep conditioning treatment, only it&#x27;s also still style-able.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair very shiny and smoother than other conditioners usually do.</li>
            <li> far as the shine element, I did find that this added a little shine to my hair, but, it wasn&#x27;t overly noticable.</li>
            <li> so wet hair doesn&#x27;t dye my clothing red!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Suave conditioners over the years and my biggest complaint has always been that it takes 2-3 times as much product to get the same result I get from other brands, so the value is lost.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work about the same as other conditioners.</li>
            <li> my hair is closer to what I get at the salon than any other similar conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> After that, I felt my hair getting frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see as much dry ends as before when I was using shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have dry,</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my hair felt a bit \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; when I would blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry cracked hair for years and for ONCE, I can say I like my hair.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair each month a deep dark brown, and</li>
            <li> I dye my hair each month a deep dark brown, and</li>
            <li> I used Moroccan oil for many years but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> She has naturally very long blondish hair &amp; it shines like spun gold in the sunlight!</li>
            <li> Nothing drastic, just a little extra glimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really thought I would have to apply at least a few handfuls, since it is a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brand, but didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> It was limp, especially at the roots.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks I found that I could only use it every other time I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to seeing Suave as the cheaper version of other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, so the bottom half of it is rather neglected, but since I started using this conditioner I&#x27;ve noticed it gaining back a bit of its luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use conditioner but not every time I shampoo; I&#x27;ve had negative experience where it makes my hair too heavy to curl naturally and feels greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually the softest after a deep conditioning treatment, but then it can often be a bit weighted down and may not hold a curl as well.</li>
            <li> It is not watered down and runny.</li>
            <li> Oh and my hair does feel just slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> So the Suave conditioner makes my hair less tangley after washing than when I use my Garnier Fructis conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a few rave reviews about the Suave Professionals</li>
            <li> Since I have used Argon oil on my face before, so I was a bit concerned the Shampoo and Conditioner from Suave would leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> My youngest straightens her hair everyday, so she won&#x27;t mind losing her waves a bit.</li>
            <li> A heavy men&#x27;s cologne/spice scent.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about the Moroccan oils for hair, but have found the products for using pre/post styling to be too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like to wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The heavy perfume scent stayed for at least a day and a half.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s  prices were less than the small bottles I bought at the store too!</li>
            <li> I  decided to take a chance and bought small bottles at a  discount store.</li>
            <li> I usually need a lot of conditioner if not using a salon brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the only flaw, unfortunately.. this shampoo &amp; conditioner depleted body &amp; curl from my hair.</li>
            <li> It even works to detangle my usually curly locks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not sure what the difference is.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair, but in the winter I feel like it gets dull and looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat frizzy hair that behaves badly in the humidity (I live in Florida</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews on the smell.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair.</li>
            <li> I  would never have purchased Suave  in the past, I was a  shampoo snob!  </li>
            <li> I mean, you have to rinse and rinse and rinse to get it out.</li>
            <li> , I have to deal with the often unpleasant task of getting my hair back in shape.  </li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how shiny and well behaved</li>
            <li> Scent is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> After just one use I have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, once I let my hair air dry it felt terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid with this conditioner</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> It gave me a sick headache after using it, because the smell sticks around throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate the smell itself.</li>
            <li> Worst of all was the scent.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this value!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every night. It smells like baby powder and other really relaxing scents i don&#x27;t even know how to explain! it is a great buy. it normally helps my hair but sometimes it just makes it smell really good. my family is always like \\&quot; what&#x27;s that smell? did you put lotion on?\\&quot; and i say \\&quot; nope, its my conditioner.\\&quot; my mom uses it now too! it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local department store and let me say its by far the best shampoo I have used. Not only does it leave your hair super soft it adds shine and manageability as well. I will definetly be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the best...this was not it.  It makes my hair feel oily...I can only use it once a week at most.  Smells great though.</li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area, so new products take a long time to get here.  After using a free sample, I couldn&#x27;t find a full size bottle locally - so Amazon, ship to the boonies!  I like the fragrance, my hair feels good and I do notice an improved shine to my hair.  The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product I bought the whole line ( Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Styling oil )for my personal use and endup buying it for friends and family. We all love it, the smell and shine that leave on your hair is amazing:):):)</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a strong fake perfume smell and doesn&#x27;t really ad much shine to my hair. Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well the first couple of weeks.  After that, I felt my hair getting frizzy and dry.  Not gonna get this again.</li>
            <li> I used Moroccan oil for many years but very expensive.  Now it is put in with this shampoo and very affordable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo, conditioner and oil.  I have somewhat frizzy hair that behaves badly in the humidity (I live in Florida so my hair is often frizzy) and I can only wash my hair twice a week because it is on the dry side.  I have used higher end shampoo and conditioner from Kerastase and Pureology with Moroccan Oil but my hair did not defrizz the way it does with Suave Moroccan Oil.  I seriously can&#x27;t believe how shiny and well behaved my hair is now.  I am getting compliments on how healthy it looks.  It is soft, has shine and body. It may be due to the fact that I am using all 3 products in the same line that my hair looks great.  Be it all 3 products or the line itself...I love my hair now!</li>
            <li> I read up on the idea of &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34;, which is skipping shampoo and using conditioner to wash your hair. This Suave brand was recommended by the person who wrote one of the articles because it has no sulphates and parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been using this conditioner to wash my hair for over a week and I can already see a difference. My hair isn&#x27;t so fly-away as it was before. When I put on my reading glasses I don&#x27;t see as much dry ends as before when I was using shampoo. And the next day my hair holds the style better than before, so I wash it less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the smell of this Suave brand and will most likely stick with it, at least for now anyway. Oh and my hair does feel just slightly thicker. Anyway there are many articles on the internet about &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; if anyone is interested.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  It is every bit as good as the high end shampoos and conditioners (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  It leaves my hair very silky and soft.  Love it - can&#x27;t beat it for the money.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous conditioner rven for suave! I can run my fingers though my hair while it&#x27;s on so it makes it easier to brush out your hair when you get out! It also gives you great voulum too! I recommend this prduct! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have used almost all of Suave products and this one right here, hits the mark!&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent to it and it makes my hair super silky soft. I don&#x27;t like the fact that Suave made this product pricer than their regular line of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the shampoo and I must say, Im very happy. I have dry, course hair and this conditioner makes it feel really nice. I like to leave it in and style my hair and it works out really well. Would recommend</li>
            <li> After I wash this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t feel smooth for my hair. I had bought repair one, I thought it&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li> The scent is of cheap spicy perfume and is strong and really nauseating.  Please Suave:  Make unscented items, especially lotions.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner for a reasonably priced one.</li>
            <li> I read a review about best shampoos for a good price.  I  would never have purchased Suave  in the past, I was a  shampoo snob!  I  decided to take a chance and bought small bottles at a  discount store. I was so surprised, I  logged on to Amazon right away and bought the shampoo and conditioner right away.  Amazon&#x27;s  prices were less than the small bottles I bought at the store too! I&#x27;ll never  be a shampoo snob again.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is just amazing!  Leaves hair soft and shiny.  Scent is subtle and not overpowering.  Love getting it in the larger bottles for this family of 6!</li>
            <li> Picked the shampoo up at local drug store for 2.99. Price was right, not too perfumey and it did make my fine, limp hair feel nice, soft and even give a little bit of sheen.. the problem was it irritated my eyes greatly. I didn&#x27;t get shampoo in my eyes directly, but I think the residue in rinse water or left on hair itself.. i have longer bangs.. did cause an allergic reaction .. I didn&#x27; put two and two together at first.. it wasn&#x27;t until i had used it about 3 times that i figured it out... my eyes just felt sore and puffy and as soon as I stopped using it.. the symptoms went away.. and I&#x27;ve never had anything like that before.. so for some, it might be a great shampoo, but not for me..</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very thick hair, and this shampoo and conditioner is perfect. It&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves our hair smooth and shiny. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner gives a lovely shine to hair! My hair is not oily by nature, so this conditioner works very well in it. My sister has more oily hair and tried it and felt that it left her hair shiny, but oily too. So, depending on your hair type, this might be just what you need for shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a few rave reviews about the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine products because they&#x27;re absolutely perfect for me. I use the conditioner every morning and it has helped with a bit of damage I did to my hair with heat (I blowdry every morning during the winter so it doesn&#x27;t freeze) and dye/bleach (another good reason to blowdry - so wet hair doesn&#x27;t dye my clothing red!). I&#x27;ve found it works best if I use a detangling comb and comb the conditioner through my hair in the shower while I wait the 2-3 minutes before rinsing. I have long, thick hair, so the bottom half of it is rather neglected, but since I started using this conditioner I&#x27;ve noticed it gaining back a bit of its luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I do NOT use the SPMI shampoo, which might be why I haven&#x27;t experienced any greasy buildup of the product. I also generally only use it on the length of my hair - not my scalp - which might also aid in avoiding buildup.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product at less than half the price of salon products!  If you want to spend more money on products too make you feel good, go ahead.  As for me, I will continue to use a well priced item and feel good for a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I find this product to work best if you actually allow it to sit in your hair for ten minutes after using the suave conditioner! it makes ur hair easy manageable it smells so nice i love it</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to brush. It smells woulderful.</li>
            <li> For a cheaper conditioner, this works quite well. I really like the scent and it seems to last on my hair even after rinsing. You do have to use quite a bit though because it is not quite as moisturizing as the more expensive conditioners.</li>
            <li> I used the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner (28 oz) after washing my hair with Suave&#x27;s Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo and was pleased with the results. Both the Shampoo and the Conditioner are infused with authentic Moroccan argan oil, a lightweight miracle oil that absorbs instantly and is known to give brilliant shine and long lasting conditioning benefits.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say the Moroccan argan oil, conditions hair while smoothing the cuticle to make hair shinier. It certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and thick. It is not watered down and runny. It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned, probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone. I have curly, colored hair and I like silicone based products so this conditioner worked well for me. It smells a bit like a perfume but it is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Before using this Suave Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner, I was using Pantene shampoo and Garnier Fructis conditioner. My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long, and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage. My hair is usually the softest after a deep conditioning treatment, but then it can often be a bit weighted down and may not hold a curl as well. This conditioner and the matching shampoo makes my hair as soft and silky as it usually is after a deep conditioning treatment, only it&#x27;s also still style-able. Using Suave Moroccan Infusion, my hair will still hold a curl and feels richly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither the shampoo or the conditioner have a lot of color or scent. The conditioner has a sweet scent that&#x27;s unlike any other hair product I&#x27;ve used. The shampoo has a very mild scent, that&#x27;s also unusual. More of a soap or mild perfume smell, than the typical citrus or floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo bottle opens from the top, and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom. So even though they look very similar, when the bottles are setting beside one another, you can tell which bottle it which by how they open. After using them on my hair, the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet. So the Suave conditioner makes my hair less tangley after washing than when I use my Garnier Fructis conditioner. After drying my hair, I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt. It was smooth and reminded me of the was one of my favorite shampoos/conditioner brands make my hair look, Pantene Ice Shine. I normally always use the Ice Shine, but it&#x27;s pricey and has a really strong overpowering fragrance. So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine. So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use, the shampoo and conditioner do work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care formula. I dye my hair each month a deep dark brown, and the Color Care formula helps retain my hair coloring, while giving it the same silky softness that this Shine formula does. Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care formula. I dye my hair each month a deep dark brown, and the Color Care formula helps retain my hair coloring, while giving it the same silky softness that this Shine formula does. Suave Moroccan Infusion is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Since I have used Argon oil on my face before, so I was a bit concerned the Shampoo and Conditioner from Suave would leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy. I was happy to realize, after using the combination, that this didn&#x27;t happen. However, at the same time, I didn&#x27;t really feel like there was any difference between using this and the other Suave Shampoo and conditioners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the fact that I have healthy hair (not permed, dyed, or blown dry) has something to do with the fact that it didn&#x27;t do much to help my hair. Anyway, I am giving it 3 stars ... Not extra good, nothing bad, just shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and I use it in conjunction with the shampoo. This stuff smells great and makes my hair feel soft and healthy, but it&#x27;s a little heavier than other conditioners and therefore leaves my hair feeling a little heavier. I love everything else about the conditioner though, so I am going to continue to use it and hope that my hair adapts to it. The ends of my hair were pretty dry and dead before but this makes them look a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and am always on the look out for deep conditioning products that can keep the ends well nourished.  Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner gives you high quality at a drugstore price. I&#x27;ve found that the conditioner leaves my hair very soft but with bounce.  My hair becomes particularly dry during winter and this conditioner has helped more than my usual.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but am very happy. Other reviewers mention the unusual fragrance but the scent didn&#x27;t stand out to me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair soft.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy either, and that was my concern.  I really like this whole new line by Suave.  My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair wonderfully soft! I LOVED the way my hair felt after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell...not so much. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to strong smells and perfume. It&#x27;s rare that I find a perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. I&#x27;ve used the same one for years. This shampoo/conditioner is very strong like perfume. It gave me a sick headache after using it, because the smell sticks around throughout the day. I think for most women this will be a plus side of using it. It didn&#x27;t stink! I didn&#x27;t hate the smell itself. I just didn&#x27;t like how string it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, pass this one up. If not, I highly recommend it due to how soft my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used up a bottle of this conditioner along with the matching shampoo. They are pretty good together as a set, surprisingly, W]with only one flaw, which I will get to..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t used Suave products in a bout 20 years, so I was a bit surprised at the quality here and that I actually liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner &amp; the matching shampoo both smell really, really great. They are not super girly smelling though, so a man can use them easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed subtle added shine from the first use, mainly on my highlights. Nothing drastic, just a little extra glimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner works really well. Great detangling capabilities and my hair was nice and soft after rinsing. It isn&#x27;t very thick or rich, but surprisingly it did work very well. I was really surprised at this. I didn&#x27;t need to use much at all. My hair is waist length, layered and curly. I usually need a lot of conditioner if not using a salon brand. With this Suave, I didn&#x27;t need a whole lot - actually needed a lot less than I thought I would. I really thought I would have to apply at least a few handfuls, since it is a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brand, but didn&#x27;t have to. This means it is very cost effective and the bottle will last a while, even with really long hair. A huge plus, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the only flaw, unfortunately.. this shampoo &amp; conditioner depleted body &amp; curl from my hair. It was limp, especially at the roots. I had to do a lot of scrunching to gain back my curl and body. I was disappointed by that. It&#x27;s ok if I am planning on straightening my hair, but I can&#x27;t live with the limpness on an everyday basis, when I want my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of shampoo &amp; conditioner would be great for someone who needs control, someone who needs to tame their hair. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for myself, but I would buy it for my teen daughters who don&#x27;t have as curly hair. My youngest straightens her hair everyday, so she won&#x27;t mind losing her waves a bit. The price is definitely great and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly - it&#x27;s a no brainer, especially when it smells amazing and works great otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise and I would actually switch from my Redken &amp; Pureology. It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.t mind losing her waves a bit. The price is definitely great and they go through shampoo &amp; conditioner so quickly - it&#x27;s a no brainer, especially when it smells amazing and works great otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish it didn&#x27;t strip the body from my hair because it is great otherwise and I would actually switch from my Redken &amp; Pureology. It is a shame to pass up something so cheap, that performs so well in all other categories.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, blonde, and fine. This product felt nice in the shower. My hair was detangled and I could comb it easily once I was out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once I let my hair air dry it felt terrible. My hair felt like it was coated in some kind of waxy substance, dry, and just limp. Worst of all was the scent. A heavy men&#x27;s cologne/spice scent. I thought it would fade after an hour or two. No such luck. The heavy perfume scent stayed for at least a day and a half. (Before I washed my hair again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again. But my regular shampoo was not enough to fully get this junk out of my hair. I had to use clarifying shampoo to get my hair to feel normal again. I gave this two stars because it did detangle my hair so well. But the bottle is going right into the trash. I give up on Suave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any special shine or glow or magical elves on carpets wafting behind me after using this, but I did notice a very unique smell, much like the classic Indian incense Nag Champa. Lightly musky but sweet, it&#x27;s by far the most interesting conditioner fragrance I&#x27;ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, nothing special, more chemicals and less natural ingredients than I prefer, but once a week or so I use this, mainly for my honey&#x27;s benefit, as she loves the smell and noticed it immediately. If you&#x27;d like a nice new hair aroma, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not very thick, but otherwise a fine conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair smooth and your hair smells good when it is dry. Use it only on the bottom of your hair, as using it on the hair on the scalp poses the risk of making your hair look greasy faster.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this line by suave. This is the first line by suave that I actually like. I have very fine, dry, frizzy hair and this shampoo works wonders! After just one use I have seen dramatic results. My hair is so shiney and soft. It feels so much healthier now. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most shine shampoos. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all so I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews on the smell. You will not be disappointed with this value!!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for awhile and it does a great job of conditioning the hair. It feels really good after using it. It seems to work about the same as other conditioners. I wouldn&#x27;t pay a lot for this product but it seems to be one of the moderate level conditioners that all seem to be about equal. It is not salon quality. It does have a good scent. I couldn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Another quality and affordable hair care product from Suave.  My wife really likes the Suave brand of hair care products.  She says that many of the fancier and considerably more expensive products on the market just seem too harsh either on her hair or skin.  This line of Moroccan Infusion products is a big hit with her.  It does a great job of giving her dark hair a beautiful shine and soft texture.  She has been using this for a couple weeks and feels like it has already made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks I found that I could only use it every other time I washed my hair.  I was noticing my hair started feeling somewhat oily after just a day or so.  I was looking forward to Suave&#x27;s take on the Moroccan oil craze. This conditioner is worthy for it&#x27;s price but doesn&#x27;t offer more than the good conditioning of any other Suave conditioner.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer my normal brands, but this is okay for shine and I love the smell of it and the way it lingers thru the day but not overwhelmingly. Conditions decent, not too cheap but not up there for me with Pantene or Aussie.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about the Moroccan oils for hair, but have found the products for using pre/post styling to be too heavy for my hair. I thought this conditioner might be a good option instead.  I noticed immediately that my hair felt a bit \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; when I would blow dry it.  I have very coarse/thick hair so I don&#x27;t like to wash it everyday.  I&#x27;m afraid with this conditioner my hair looked great the first day, but greasy the next.  If you wash everyday, perhaps this conditioner would work for you, but probably not if you have fine hair.  I still keep this conditioner in my shower, I just use it once in a while in the rotation of conditioners.  I also recommending adding extra rinsing time when using it.  It has a nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> I do use conditioner but not every time I shampoo; I&#x27;ve had negative experience where it makes my hair too heavy to curl naturally and feels greasy.  Neither of those were a problem with a sample I was sent of this and the shampoo version of Moroccan Infusion from Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all conditioners this is used up much more quickly than shampoos but I discovered that the conditioner lasted two full days in terms of controlling flyaway and puffy hair post brushing.  Used with the shampoo it lasted almost three days in all.  My hair was smoother but curled just as well and had a shine to it.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on my hair but this is reasonable for the results.</li>
            <li> I order this for my daughters. It smells wonderful and provides plenty of moisture for their thick, semi-coarse hair. Their hair is more shiny and manageable with it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product when I first starting using it but after daily use for a few weeks I really didn&#x27;t like how it was changing the texture of my hair.  I have long, straight, fine hair that I usually straighten on a daily basis.  I was looking for a product that would give a nice shine, which this product did for about a week.  After that it was like the conditioner was building up on my hair and actually made my hair appear dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the scent and price of this product but I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and makes it so much easier to detangle.  My last conditioner made my hair feel dry after I used it. I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> great for controlling static electricity.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well!  I have straight hair, but my daughter has curly hair.  Both of our hair is really soft and manageable after we use this.  I can even comb my daughter&#x27;s hair without wetting it again.  It also leaves a nice shine, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice soft clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter, the shampoo &amp; conditioner both.  I absolutely love the scent &amp; she does too.  You can actually smell it throughout the house when she showers, lol.  Some say it is strong, but it smells so good &amp; her hair always smells so good &amp; she gets loads of compliments about how good her hair always smells.  She has naturally very long blondish hair &amp; it shines like spun gold in the sunlight!</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals&#x27; Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner does a great job of conditioning and leaving your hair feeling smooth.  I tend to be cautious of shampoos and conditioners that have oil because of rinsing and the feel of hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moroccan Infusion line seems to do a good job with shine.  Pretty much a shine that lasts all day without weighing down hair.  Much like their shampoo, the scent wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and did not linger too much after rinsing.  Like most other hair products that contain oils, I found rinsing to be a more difficult, although that might be due to my water type as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Moroccan Infusion line is a great step in Suave&#x27;s product selection and offers a new and inventive product that will please many.  The oil content was a bit too much for my liking, but I think many people will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use chemicals in my hair about four times a year between keratin treatment and professional coloring.  In addition, enjoying outdoor activities often, the sun can prove harsh to my hair in the summer time.  Dullness and brittle ends set in mid-autumn and by the early winter, I have to deal with the often unpleasant task of getting my hair back in shape.  I don&#x27;t like adding oils to my hair so the traditional moroccan oil was not an option.  The Suave Professionals products were affordable enough to try the shampoo and conditioner and see how my hair responded.  I am totally impressed, and satisfied with both the scent and the creamy texture of the conditioner.  I comb the conditioner through and let it soak into my wet hair while in the shower to get the full benefit of the moisturizing elements.  It even works to detangle my usually curly locks.  The overall shine left when I blow dry my hair is closer to what I get at the salon than any other similar conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.  I am very pleased with this Suave product and recommend it to anyone with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and best shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three of the Moroccan lines of Suave - the Keratin-infused, Color Care, and now the Infusion Shine.  I have to say, all are great products and work as promised, leaving hair clean, smooth, with less frizzies and more life.  At the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of them - they have a nice clean smell and work as promised.  The shine conditioner went on smoothly and left hair feeling smooth and yes, with a bit of added shine.  I used this with the moroccan oil style by Suave and was really impressed with the end result.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot. I had been using another product similar to this one but at 4-5 times the cost. The results from using this product were the same as using the more expensive product. My hair, which has a lot of frizz, was smooth, soft and shiny. The smell is little strong but is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a good alternative to the more expensive conditioners with Moroccan oil. You should use it in conjunction with the shampoo for better results.</li>
            <li> Just like the suave Moroccan Infusion Shampoo this conditioner works well also. It smells just as good and it left my hair soft and shiny. To get great results make sure to use this conditioner with the same brand of shampoo. Even though I liked this product I would rather use the Suave conditioning masque rather than this because the masque seems to penetrate the scalp more especially while deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> This is the second Suave conditioner if its type that I have used.  It really seems to be no different than the other Moroccan conditioner.  It smells the same, and my hair looks the same after using it.  I&#x27;ve noticed, however, the longer I use these new Suave Moroccan products, the more they start making my hair flyaway looking, just like the usual Suave products.  Also, I don&#x27;t think the Moroccan ones smell as good as the cheaper Suave shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner for a month now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to seeing Suave as the cheaper version of other brands.  They are decent quality for less.  This time, Suave really outdid itself.  The whole line of Moroccan Infusion is incredible.  I love the sweet, savory, nutty scent.  It looks and feels rich and creamy, like  something only the wealthy could afford.  For now, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner as a system, and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love the musky, yet feminine scent of Suave&#x27;s entire Moroccan Infusion line. It&#x27;s a strong, noticeable scent that does not dissipate much during the day. This conditioner left my hair very shiny and smoother than other conditioners usually do. I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of Suave&#x27;s products, but the Moroccan Infusion line has won me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is great for average hair and daily use. If you have harder to manage hair, frizzy hair or damaged hair, I would definitely recommend using Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask instead. I used that before getting this and found that it has a bit more softening power.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner has a very strong but inoffensive odor, earthy and sweet at the same time.  It does noticeably condition the hair, making it smooth and shiny but without leaving a heavy residue and making it easier to style.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, wavy hair, which has highlights and lowlights and the ends of my hair tend to get dryed out. My usual and favorite shampoo is [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and I also use the matching conditioner [[ASIN:B005SPETH2 Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. If you use and like the former, you will like this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner and the matching shampoo [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo 28 oz]] has a heavenly scent, which lasts on my hair all day if I let my hair dry naturally. It&#x27;s just a fabulously Moroccan spicy scent, which lingers and it is totally relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also love is that this conditioner helps my dry ends, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the rest of my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shine element, I did find that this added a little shine to my hair, but, it wasn&#x27;t overly noticable. It added just a small healthy sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it for someone with a similiar hair type or for someone who loves a richly scented shampoo.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about what this does to my hair. The smell is amazing.  The feeling of my hair is luxurious, soft well behaved, super shine, smells so good!!</li>
            <li> Recently, I have been using this conditioning product every time I wash my hair and it leaves my hair pretty soft with a pleasant fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong. I think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s affordable and it does the job well. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my hair, but in the winter I feel like it gets dull and looks terrible.  That was before I discovered the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine conditioner.  This is incredible and paired with the shampoo it looks great and makes my hair great.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner to go along with the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shampoo.  I love the combination of the two together - I feel as if I am getting a better infusion if I am both shampooing and conditioning with the same.  I have to say that my hair does look more shiny than ever before and it feels just wonderful.  The scent is very nice, not overpowering but strong enough to linger a little while after your hair is dry.  I like that a lot.  I want a scent that is noticeable but not too much.  I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using this.  I already have oily hair to begin with so I refuse to use anything that adds to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with Suave, you can&#x27;t beat the price for the outstanding quality you get!  Seriously, why pay more??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Suave conditioners over the years and my biggest complaint has always been that it takes 2-3 times as much product to get the same result I get from other brands, so the value is lost.  This is not the case with this product!  The first time I used it, I used what I would consider a normal amount for Suave conditioner and it was WAY too much!  Now, I&#x27;m at a point where I use a very small amount of this conditioner and am getting great results.  Even though this is more expensive that many of the other Suave conditioning products, I will definitely be buying it again because a little goes a long way!  I&#x27;m  not sure what the difference is.  I don&#x27;t actually know what Moroccan argan oil is, but maybe that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product conditions so well, I also agree that the shininess of my hair has increased.  This may be due to the Moroccan argan oil or just because my hair is better conditioned overall, but the end result is that my hair definitely has more shine to it.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughters hair in the hopes that it would help her not have so many knots in her hair....well, it helps a lot and leaves the her hair very soft. It also has a very nice fragrance that everyone likes. The Suave Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner passed the wifey test, she likes it a lot. The kids love it, too. The only problem I have with it, is it takes a lot of rinsing! I mean, you have to rinse and rinse and rinse to get it out. While it might not be the best conditioner out there, we are very happy with it and think it offers a good value....unless you factor in the water bill. ;)</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this conditioner (and the shampoo)  I live in Florida and when I&#x27;m not biking in the hot sun, dipping my hair in a chlorine pool or swimming in salt water, then maybe I&#x27;m caring for my hair.  This product actually conditions and shines and does just what it says.  I&#x27;ve had dry cracked hair for years and for ONCE, I can say I like my hair.  Love the smell as well.  I get a lot of compliments on the smell - it&#x27;s clean and a bit exotic.  Yay!  Bye Bye Pantene after 20 years.</li>
