    <ol>
            <li>excellent, recommended product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It was perfect before!</li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>A great product to pair with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great stuff they do whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>The whitening strips are great but</li>
            <li>way too expensive.the truth is this product works jus as great</li>
            <li>, what to  say...not happy...</li>
            <li>A great find.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love this perfect product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>if it did not work good</li>
            <li>A great product;  Amazon-pricing better than at drugstore.  </li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced product, and the results are impressive at any price.</li>
            <li>Its safe, it works and did I say it works?!</li>
            <li>Love how the whitening booster works!  </li>
            <li>I would nt have spend money on this more than once!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this stuff!</li>
            <li>Could be better!  </li>
            <li>I think this works better too!</li>
            <li>I honestly believed my daughter had gotten her teeth professionally-whitened without my knowledge.  </li>
            <li>Have a nice day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of foamy and cuts the strong-minty flavor of my toothpaste.</li>
            <li>the heck\\&quot; kind of attitude.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m not complaining, as it&#x27;s done a great job, and is a better value and more effective for me than whitening strips, which also can&#x27;t claim to \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; teeth, as strips also use hydrogen peroxide as the brightening/stain removal agent.</li>
            <li>Easy and effective!</li>
            <li>Easy, safe, affordable and effective - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of any whitening treatment that could be more convenient either.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product that really works with consistsnt use,  i use it almost daily...and the price is better than the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many whitening treatments I have tried too many to remember.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it more than 3 times.trust me</li>
            <li>I love this booster, been using it for awhile</li>
            <li>It works mostly as a plaque remover as its &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use it for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>I have better luck with just diluted H2O2.</li>
            <li>I will start off saying that I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>An easy, cheap and super effective way to whiten your teeth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly suggest giving this booster a try before investing in more costly whitening products.</li>
            <li>My teeth are in good condition, but they just weren&#x27;t as bright and white as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>WOW it works great.</li>
            <li>EASY and</li>
            <li>I had a friend recommend this product as an easy way to whiten.</li>
            <li>I asked my dentist what would be effective to help brighten my smile, something that was mild and safe, and this is what he recommended.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on TOP of your regular toothpaste as it doesn&#x27;t taste good on</li>
            <li>A product I have been using for a long time with good results!</li>
            <li>Shipping was free.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t make my gums sensitive.</li>
            <li>So was really excited to discover this product.  </li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this booster, but now that my teeth look so bright, clean and shiny, I&#x27;ll probably do so only 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using this along with the tooth paste for a month, I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in appearance yet, but I have noticed a tremendous amount of sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have been using th A&amp;H booster for a long time, this is by far the best</li>
            <li>My husband has darker harder to whiten teeth and he saw great results with this product too.</li>
            <li>But they are not a bad color to start with.</li>
            <li>While pleased with the fast and impressive initial results, in my second week of using this whitening booster, I noticed a case of diminishing returns.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant taste, no increased sensitivity, no waiting...</li>
            <li>It makes my toothpaste foam a bit more, and has a slightly distinctive taste, but overall works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t going to give you a \\&quot;celebrity white\\&quot; smile but will keep coffee and tea staining at bay.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted a brighter smile, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you use the 3x arm and hammer whitening booster with Colgate whitening toothpaste, you WILL get the whitest teeth possible.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, it whitens your teeth nicely in 7 days and keeps them white with regular use.</li>
            <li>When it was first sold it was a 3.0 OZ bottle that stood on its cap</li>
            <li>and yet the pricing is higher.</li>
            <li>(I used it twice a day for a month) and, instead, my gums started bleeding pretty often</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to try this because of my history with whitening products.</li>
            <li>This really works with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>and this is much easier.  </li>
            <li>I let my roommate try it, and she said they helped her coffee stains a lot, but didn&#x27;t really whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use than strips and gels and mouth trays.  </li>
            <li>i really dont notice any whiter teeth</li>
            <li>really dont see my teeth any whiter.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is foamy.  </li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t going to see results as fast as a whitening strip</li>
            <li>So, I think it is really more trouble than it is worth.</li>
            <li>Except for one day after my third use, when I experienced just a bit of sensitivity (and not any more than I would after a few days using any other whitener, even though I don&#x27;t otherwise have \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot;), this whitening booster hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I liked the old packaging better, it was a firm bottle that stood upside down.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a whitening product without any artificial sweeteners and that I wouldn&#x27;t have to leave on my teeth for half an hour, and this fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Just add along with your toothpaste and then brush your teeth as normal - doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are pretty much the same looking.</li>
            <li>I expected more &amp;#34;whiteness,&amp;#34; but I have only been using it off and on for a week or two.  </li>
            <li>You squeeze a small amount on top of your toothpaste and brush as normal.</li>
            <li>My very sensitive teeth have handled this product without an issue</li>
            <li>It is a clear gel and you add some to your toothbrush along with your toothpaste and just brush normally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried strips, whitening toothpastes, and many other whitening products/methods short of professional teeth whitening, so I bought this with a \\&quot;what</li>
            <li>I was able to see a slight difference after three uses and my husband actually noticed after five.</li>
            <li>This thing works --- the whitening effect is markedly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for far longer than a week</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this enough as long as you&#x27;re not trying for an overnight success.</li>
            <li>Overall it looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I discovered that I can just use a good whitening toothpaste (like Jason Powersmile anti-cavity &amp; whitening), and get merely the same results.  </li>
            <li>(they are slightly yellowish) and I did not expect them to become super white.</li>
            <li>wow my teeth are white.  </li>
            <li>have not got white teeth naturally</li>
            <li>Impossible to know for sure that the product really was new.</li>
            <li>tube is really easy to apply to your toothpaste, and since you&#x27;re only using a little bit at a time the bottle lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>(FYI, I&#x27;ve been using the booster with Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Extra Whitening toothpaste and with Crest Complete Extra Whitening toothpaste.)    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use as long as it isn&#x27;t some tooth-whitening emergency because it does take at least a week to see results.</li>
            <li>The description did note that product was &#x27;unboxed&#x27; but I still expected it to arrived sealed in some way and looking new.</li>

            <li> wow my teeth are white.  </li>
            <li> have not got white teeth naturally</li>
            <li> Impossible to know for sure that the product really was new.</li>
            <li> tube is really easy to apply to your toothpaste, and since you&#x27;re only using a little bit at a time the bottle lasts longer than I expected.</li>

            <li> The new regular squeeze tube unfortunately makes more mess.</li>
            <li> Now, after just a few days, my teeth are already a very noticeable few shades lighter -- so far, whiter than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I haven&#x27;t even used it for a full week yet.</li>
            <li> every other day due to sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> If there has been, it&#x27;s been too subtle to really notice.</li>
            <li> No harsh feeling, no tooth ache like with other harsh whitening products.</li>
            <li> The ordered product arrived on time, but the bottle was dirty -- covered in some dark sticky stuff -- and bottle had no protective seal on the top at all.</li>
            <li> and I can see a slight difference, even when I drink coffee constantly!  </li>
            <li> So in short, I decided not to waste my money on this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, twice a day, just like the directions say - I have not used any other whitening products in 3 years - I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> This works and beats the heck out of strips, gels and other whitening methods.  </li>
            <li> you just apply an amount equal to the toothpaste used and brush as usual.  </li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t offputting like some whiteners can be, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or make me drool like other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, thankfully.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I can see a little difference but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Now they have gone the way of the half gallon of ice cream which was a half gallon, then 1.75 quarts and now 1.5 quarts</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take a little time to see a difference</li>
            <li> I got it few weeks ago and no damage.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff made them noticeably whiter after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;d used dentist prescribed pastes that had to be worn overnight</li>
            <li> (they did not do that before using this product), just like if I had small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure why the company would make the packaging worse...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Tanda whitening system from Neiman Marcus (extremely expensive - like around $200 expensive).</li>
            <li> I hate using trays and whitestrips because it is such a pain the neck.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this product and their was no seal or wrap around it, and it looked very dirty like it had been on the shelves a long time, I threw it away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have stains, and found this product useless.</li>
            <li> White strips taste awful and hurt my teeth, but I have none of those issues with this.</li>
            <li> I had just gotten my teeth cleaned, but still had very slight yellowing at the base of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not&lt;br /&gt;purchase again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste nasty which I was worried about.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t going to give you a \\&quot;celebrity white\\&quot; smile but will keep coffee and tea staining at bay.  I don&#x27;t know of any whitening treatment that could be more convenient either.  Just add along with your toothpaste and then brush your teeth as normal - doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this here on Amazon in September of 2014 and paid $4.17 for a 2.5 oz tube.  Shipping was free.</li>
            <li> The ordered product arrived on time, but the bottle was dirty -- covered in some dark sticky stuff -- and bottle had no protective seal on the top at all. Impossible to know for sure that the product really was new. The description did note that product was &#x27;unboxed&#x27; but I still expected it to arrived sealed in some way and looking new.</li>
            <li> A great product to pair with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. Works well!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a whitening product without any artificial sweeteners and that I wouldn&#x27;t have to leave on my teeth for half an hour, and this fit the bill perfectly. I&#x27;ve noticed some difference after using it for a couple weeks, and although it was nothing miraculous I was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is really easy to apply to your toothpaste, and since you&#x27;re only using a little bit at a time the bottle lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, twice a day, just like the directions say - I have not used any other whitening products in 3 years - I don&#x27;t need to. People always comment on how white my teeth are. Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t make my gums sensitive.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love this perfect product</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the tooth paste for a month, I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in appearance yet, but I have noticed a tremendous amount of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year, and recently decided to stop it.  The reason is - I discovered that I can just use a good whitening toothpaste (like Jason Powersmile anti-cavity &amp; whitening), and get merely the same results.  So in short, I decided not to waste my money on this product anymore.</li>
            <li> This has become as essential as toothpaste to me.&lt;br /&gt;I finally discovered that WALMART carries it now for like 3 bux. Its safe, it works and did I say it works?!</li>
            <li> Great stuff they do whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can not see any whitening results.</li>
            <li> I expected more &amp;#34;whiteness,&amp;#34; but I have only been using it off and on for a week or two.  In the past, I&#x27;d used dentist prescribed pastes that had to be worn overnight and this is much easier.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a lightening of stains (I smoke and drink a lot of Diet Coke).  Convenience can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve also been brushing when I don&#x27;t use it with the Arm &amp; Hammer whitening toothpaste.  I think the two work hand-in-hand.  I&#x27;m still hoping to take it up a notch shade-wise.</li>
            <li> I honestly believed my daughter had gotten her teeth professionally-whitened without my knowledge.  I asked her about it and she credited this product!  After using it for a couple of weeks, I have now purchased tubes for everyone else in my family.  This works and beats the heck out of strips, gels and other whitening methods.  No unpleasant taste, no increased sensitivity, no waiting...you just apply an amount equal to the toothpaste used and brush as usual.  EASY and the results are definitely noticeable!</li>
            <li> I just wanted a brighter smile, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I let my roommate try it, and she said they helped her coffee stains a lot, but didn&#x27;t really whiten the teeth. I don&#x27;t have stains, and found this product useless. On the plus side, it does not hurt or take any time out of your day. I only recommend this to those who are wanting to get rid of stains</li>
            <li> This product really helps give my everyday whitening toothpaste a boost. It&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product that really works with consistsnt use,  i use it almost daily...and the price is better than the drugstore. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Noticed a difference after 1 day! Easy and effective!</li>
            <li> I got it few weeks ago and no damage.  I will try put it in dishwasher machine someday.. Have a nice day.</li>
            <li> I have been using th A&amp;H booster for a long time, this is by far the best</li>
            <li> Love how the whitening booster works!  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I can see a slight difference, even when I drink coffee constantly!  Make sure you put it on TOP of your regular toothpaste as it doesn&#x27;t taste good on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement on the color of my teeth. They are pretty much the same looking. But they are not a bad color to start with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for weeks now with my fluoride whitening toothpaste.  I see no difference at all.  I am an Arm &amp; Hammer&lt;br /&gt;customer.  Will only use their laundry detergents.  So was really excited to discover this product.  Very disappointed and will not&lt;br /&gt;purchase again.</li>
            <li> excellent, recommended product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many whitening treatments I have tried too many to remember. The whitening strips are great but way too expensive.the truth is this product works jus as great I&#x27;ve purchased it more than 3 times.trust me if it did not work good I would nt have spend money on this more than once!</li>
            <li> I love this booster, been using it for awhile and it does wonders on my teeth.</li>
            <li> A great product;  Amazon-pricing better than at drugstore.  Items I received were sealed, there is over 18 montths before expiration date.  This really works with consistent use.  And about twice a month, I&#x27;d &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; the whitening by using it like a whitener-gel.  I&#x27;ll  put 1/4 tsp dash onto mouthguard-pieces (upper and lower), put over teeth.  I&#x27;ll let &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; for 5 minutes. then &amp;#34;Sonicare-away&amp;#34; with toothbrushing with regular toothpaste. This thing works --- the whitening effect is markedly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product. I&#x27;m still using it, although I use it once every other day due to sensitive gums. I was able to see a slight difference after three uses and my husband actually noticed after five. The taste isn&#x27;t offputting like some whiteners can be, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or make me drool like other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, thankfully. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough as long as you&#x27;re not trying for an overnight success.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really works. I hate using trays and whitestrips because it is such a pain the neck.  I decided to try this after seeing it at the grocery store.  It is a clear gel and you add some to your toothbrush along with your toothpaste and just brush normally.  My teeth are actually really white already but this stuff made them noticeably whiter after just a few days.  I actually looked in the mirror and thought to myself wow my teeth are white.  My husband has darker harder to whiten teeth and he saw great results with this product too. He uses it twice daily while brushing. It is so much easier to use than strips and gels and mouth trays.  I am so glad I tried this stuff!</li>
            <li> i really dont notice any whiter teeth and ive followed the instructions use it for a month really dont see my teeth any whiter.</li>
            <li> When it was first sold it was a 3.0 OZ bottle that stood on its cap or else you could not get it to flow onto your toothbrush. Now they have gone the way of the half gallon of ice cream which was a half gallon, then 1.75 quarts and now 1.5 quarts and yet the pricing is higher. It works mostly as a plaque remover as its &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34;. You find that out after using it . It is obvious you have &amp;#34;abraded&amp;#34; your gums. It makes you feel like you have really brushed your teeth.</li>
            <li> After 7 days of using it, I have to say that there was no visible results. It improved a bit only after my second week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> Could be better!  After a week of use I can see a little difference but not what I expected.  This stuff really is foamy.  If you want truly radiant white teeth you must still have them done by a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you are supposed to use this continually but if you did it would make about a 50% improvement.  So, I think it is really more trouble than it is worth.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it whitens your teeth nicely in 7 days and keeps them white with regular use. The product deserves 5 stars. No harsh feeling, no tooth ache like with other harsh whitening products. I use it for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I liked the old packaging better, it was a firm bottle that stood upside down. The new regular squeeze tube unfortunately makes more mess. Not sure why the company would make the packaging worse... It was perfect before!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and their was no seal or wrap around it, and it looked very dirty like it had been on the shelves a long time, I threw it away</li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews and I hoped it was going to work on me too, but...it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not got white teeth naturally (they are slightly yellowish) and I did not expect them to become super white. However, I did not see any changes at all (I used it twice a day for a month) and, instead, my gums started bleeding pretty often (they did not do that before using this product), just like if I had small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is related to using this product and, in fact, now that I have stopped, they don&#x27;t bleed anymore (coincidence?).&lt;br /&gt;Well, what to  say...not happy...</li>
            <li> A product I have been using for a long time with good results!</li>
            <li> I asked my dentist what would be effective to help brighten my smile, something that was mild and safe, and this is what he recommended. I had never heard of it, but WOW it works great. You squeeze a small amount on top of your toothpaste and brush as normal. It doesn&#x27;t taste nasty which I was worried about. It&#x27;s kind of foamy and cuts the strong-minty flavor of my toothpaste. I have been using it for about ten days and I definitely notice a difference. I had just gotten my teeth cleaned, but still had very slight yellowing at the base of my teeth. This whitening booster is making my teeth whiter, and it&#x27;s so much easier to use than those messy white strips that you plaster to your teeth. I think this works better too! Easy, safe, affordable and effective - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I had a friend recommend this product as an easy way to whiten. While this obviously won&#x27;t turn your teeth into pearly whites the way whitening in the office or with a kit would, for the price and effort I did see a difference after a week a so.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in my teeth within two weeks! It makes my toothpaste foam a bit more, and has a slightly distinctive taste, but overall works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for far longer than a week and I don&#x27;t see any change. If there has been, it&#x27;s been too subtle to really notice. I was hoping for better. I guess we&#x27;ll see when I get my Invisalign attachments off and see if there is a color mismatch from where the attachments were. Overall it looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried strips, whitening toothpastes, and many other whitening products/methods short of professional teeth whitening, so I bought this with a \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; kind of attitude. And heck, does it work! My teeth are in good condition, but they just weren&#x27;t as bright and white as I&#x27;d like. Now, after just a few days, my teeth are already a very noticeable few shades lighter -- so far, whiter than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I haven&#x27;t even used it for a full week yet. (FYI, I&#x27;ve been using the booster with Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Extra Whitening toothpaste and with Crest Complete Extra Whitening toothpaste.)    Except for one day after my third use, when I experienced just a bit of sensitivity (and not any more than I would after a few days using any other whitener, even though I don&#x27;t otherwise have \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot;), this whitening booster hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort. This is a very reasonably priced product, and the results are impressive at any price. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much whiter my teeth will get after an additional few days&#x27; use. I&#x27;d strongly suggest giving this booster a try before investing in more costly whitening products. I&#x27;ll never use strips again!    Update - 6/25/14: While pleased with the fast and impressive initial results, in my second week of using this whitening booster, I noticed a case of diminishing returns. Did a bit of research, and it seems that to actually \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; teeth, a whitening product must contain carbamide peroxide. Products that simply remove stains and brighten (like this booster) contain hydrogen peroxide. So I guess now that this booster has removed any dullness from my teeth, I&#x27;m not seeing further results, and I probably shouldn&#x27;t expect additional improvements. Still, I&#x27;m not complaining, as it&#x27;s done a great job, and is a better value and more effective for me than whitening strips, which also can&#x27;t claim to \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; teeth, as strips also use hydrogen peroxide as the brightening/stain removal agent. I&#x27;ll continue to use this booster, but now that my teeth look so bright, clean and shiny, I&#x27;ll probably do so only 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Tanda whitening system from Neiman Marcus (extremely expensive - like around $200 expensive). Honestly, if you use the 3x arm and hammer whitening booster with Colgate whitening toothpaste, you WILL get the whitest teeth possible.  FYI - I have also used the whiteners from the dentist (the gel ones you put in your mouth trays).</li>
            <li> I received this a while back and ive been using it every day and night when i brush my teeth. Personally, i dont feel like it makes a difference like its supposed to. My teeth dont look whiter at all...</li>
            <li> did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it said it would. I have better luck with just diluted H2O2.</li>
            <li> I will start off saying that I love this product. Yes, it does take a little time to see a difference but it does work. I was hesitant at first to try this because of my history with whitening products. My very sensitive teeth have handled this product without an issue and I have had no pain with it at all. You aren&#x27;t going to see results as fast as a whitening strip but you are not going to have pain that can be associated with those types of products either.</li>
            <li> Works well and it&#x27;s easy to use as long as it isn&#x27;t some tooth-whitening emergency because it does take at least a week to see results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really fantastic. An easy, cheap and super effective way to whiten your teeth! I saw it on a beauty blog and I&#x27;m really glad I did. White strips taste awful and hurt my teeth, but I have none of those issues with this. A great find.</li>
