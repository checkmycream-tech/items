            <li>I LOVE the feel of this soap.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>the bar version is my favorite soap, so i thought i would try this liquid body wash.</li>
            <li>it is everything the bar is and more.</li>
            <li>It works on pimples, yeast problems on the skin and much more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Nubian Heritage.</li>
            <li>Love this product started using it when I had a psoriasis outbreak and now use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Great smell and isn&#x27;t drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this item for my bath.</li>
            <li>I love it for them.</li>
            <li>we haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I still love this soap.</li>
            <li>and I must say I now love the body wash as much as I love the lotion.</li>
            <li>The wash is also more like a jelly like consistency</li>
            <li>The body wash smells wonderful, and would leave your skin smelling the same.</li>
            <li>I love this soap but it is inconsistent.</li>
            <li>And this soap has been my most salvating weapon towards the stubborn acne on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I tried it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the phisoderm I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the body wash</li>
            <li>I love the sultry smell and how my skin glows.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it is helping my acne</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more!!</li>
            <li>It has a very distinctive and pleasant aroma as well, and as a man I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light licorice scent that makes the shower enjoyable but doesn&#x27;t stay with you all day, which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pea sized amount is good for your whole face.</li>
            <li>At the beginning the smell was awesome to us,but after the burn we believe either it is due to fragrance or either and the foaming agent.</li>
            <li>It has a very light, inoffensive, sweet smell.</li>
            <li>we love how it makes you feel clean and if you have acne or eczema</li>
            <li>It has a strong colone smell...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong though, so perhaps not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>The bar seems too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have a process to make sure I get the full benefits of the soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked how it really lathered, and it smelled very sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of body washes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about 2 weeks now and am already a huge fan.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your skin silky smooth and soft, but it also leaves skin with the most wonderful scent for hours!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I just can&#x27;t help but enjoy the way it looks....</li>
            <li>really fantastic-</li>
            <li>I completely enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, but I follow up my routine with the proper moisture care after</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it runs out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-</li>
            <li>The spots are perfectly round, perfectly lined up polka dots about a 3/4 cm in diameter each.  </li>
            <li>The SM soap used to available at Target for about $10</li>
            <li>They both get rid of any acne that I have and make the skin all smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have extreemly sensitive fair skin and have had no problems with the soap or lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves skin feeling soft and bump free.</li>
            <li>leaves skin smelling good, soft, and clean....</li>
            <li>It worth every penny !</li>
            <li>I would like it to be more consistent.</li>
            <li>I use an amount about the size of my pinky nail on a loofah and get a nice lather that leaves my whole body feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>They rinse clean, yet keep the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean without the film.</li>
            <li>Phisoderm does a a good job but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>Nice soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is... not a bad one.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin super soft and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>and there ingredients were very precise and simple until one day I was in need of more and decided to order some</li>
            <li>Took look at the ingredients and my eyes quickly focused on the &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Luckily i found this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural, certified organic, and vegan/cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference if I&#x27;m being completely honest.</li>
            <li>good thing is that it lasts a long time so even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey</li>
            <li>Our new favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>After using this, you need a good moisturizer because letting your skin dry out will break you out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lather is wonderful, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my skin feels alittle bit dry after use.</li>
            <li>does the job to get my whole body clean and it feels clean as I wash.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help much, but this stuff has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my back already as well as my skin seems to be evening out and has more fullness and life to it.</li>
            <li>And it smells like a light baby powder so its really refreshi</li>
            <li>Also, bars of soap kind of gross me out.</li>
            <li>this is great to help clear it up topically.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell and helped relieve the psoriasis itch.</li>
            <li>i hope the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten very positive comments on how I smell now that I am using the product.</li>
            <li>It will leave your skin clean, soft, and smooth for days.</li>
            <li>My skin is left smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this exact bottle of body wash from my local vitamin store &amp; fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find here in Indiana, so I was happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>While using them, they have all lathered pretty well.</li>
            <li>makes skin feel soft and smooth..</li>
            <li>All natural, exfoliating, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth without a soapy residue after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>my first go around with</li>
            <li>It helped with my acne (face &amp; back) and I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body wash; and I have stated that personally to Nubian Heritage,</li>
            <li>would most definitely recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li>and it really works !</li>
            <li>However, my acne is pretty hormonal</li>
            <li>but my back have breakouts all the time and its not the most atractive.</li>
            <li>~~Thanks!</li>
            <li>I find I keep reordering this one in spite of the stash of higher end body washes I have.</li>
            <li>When the sensitivity first started and I hadn&#x27;t figured out what was causing it,</li>
            <li>but they actually make my skin feel better.  </li>
            <li>It was a smooth, sudsy soap, but it did little to reduce my bacne.&lt;br /&gt;Before that, I used Neutrogena Grapefruit Body Wash to treat my acne, and it worked splendidly, but I have been very faithful to natural/organic hygiene for the last year</li>
            <li>The fact that this product can clear up acne and keep skin moisturized at the same time is amazing to me.</li>
            <li>have simply not been able to find a whole lot of body washes targeted at body acne.</li>
            <li>Nubian heritage black soap leaves my skin feeling amazing</li>
            <li>I have mild hyperpigmentation and wondered if this would help clear it up...</li>
            <li>I washed my face and shoulders with it after a light workout and the next day had a lot of pimples on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>My problem with that was they were very inconsistant in having it in stock.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li>(I am always getting comments on how soft my hands are now despite the fact that I rarely apply any lotion).</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are very upset &amp; the face is still burning with ice packs.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>Much too drying for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, very sudsy but doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  </li>
            <li>The spots don&#x27;t itch really, but just looks like it might start to one day if I didn&#x27;t make</li>
            <li>After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I will always keep a bottle of this handy because it makes my skin softer than anything else has in the last ten years!</li>
            <li>Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>just wish u guys would go back to how it originally was</li>
            <li>It has a subtle smell that is not too feminine and not too masculine (perfect for both my boyfriend and myself) that lingers on your skin for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have tried bath and body works products and while the smell good, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything changing with the products they say improve skin, however I still use the products in combination with the African Black Soap Lotion.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it comes to body washes, Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture black soaps are my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually quite content just using a bit of shampoo or whatever is handy.  </li>
            <li>While it does a decent job of cleansing while not stripping moisture from my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would and probably will recommend this product to my friends and family and plan on purchasing more in the future when I need to.</li>
            <li>Overall, the benefits that I&#x27;ve already seen combined with the company&#x27;s healthy and sustainable practices are enough to make me say that I will probably never try anything else!  </li>
            <li>The shop was charging several dollars more for the same product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the particular batch or what.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few natural products that I could find that has no coconut in it and is still effective.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes this soap in particular.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I can use on my super allergy-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using this with the creamy lotion as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick and gooey, lathers up quickly and easily, and i don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>really helps sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my skin, and also moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I have not yet used this on my face because I already have a favorite Lush product, Dark Angels scrub, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works as a face wash.</li>
            <li>especially the raw, pure kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>He developed eczema on his hand and placed it on for 20 mins, and it was gone!</li>
            <li>It helped with my acne and eczema and made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I love Nubian&#x27;s soap bars too, and usually use those for my face.</li>
            <li>Do not recommend using on infants because its a little strong for there skin.</li>
            <li>and THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THE PRODUCT new packaging</li>
            <li>Would refer to nearly any one, as I have very sensitive skin and acen prone.</li>
            <li>Usually after one lather and rinse I feel smooth when using the other ones, but this never gives that same result no matter how many times I lather and rinse.  </li>
            <li>Soap color is black but lather is rich and plenteous.</li>
            <li>I found it way more drying and hard to keep.</li>
            <li>i was hoping using a natural soap product would help with my ance and maybe clear some of the scars which makes me feel really conscious when wearing sun dresses or tube tops.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, and no it doesn&#x27;t help, but I don&#x27;t know any soup or natural product that helps the severity I have.  </li>
            <li>and I suffer from sensitive skin, and eczema.</li>
            <li>I was always trying soaps and washes for moisturizing, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was please with the product and fast delivery,I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Mrs. and daughter use this soap and say it leaves their skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this product as an adult and used it on my toddler age 4.</li>
            <li>Once I rinse the soap off there is no heavy soap residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>so much, when using just a tiny amount of soap.</li>
            <li>I switched over to NH-ABBW and my skin is so soft and stays moisturized.</li>
            <li>think I will be using this until I see another natural soap targeted for body acne.</li>
            <li>i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>started having really sensitive skin since about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I even tried the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stuff too (Aveno, Jergens natural, Olay natural,</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the fragrance is strong enough to stay with you for a little while but is far from being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Label read EXACTLY the same, but soap was NOT the same.</li>
            <li>overall, i highly recommend this soap product anyway.</li>
            <li>a whole bunch of new ingredients and chemicals they freaking took out the main ingredient \\&quot;AFRICAN BLACK</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to make this product seem bad, however the facts are more important .Ask</li>
            <li>It has also already helped clear up breakouts on my upper back and arms from the intense summer heat and has seemed to improve the overall feel and texture of my skin</li>
            <li>You feel clean after using it but it does not feel heavy and layered like regular soaps</li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming on my skin either, its just right!</li>
            <li>I have been using the African Black Body wash for a while now, but I was originally buying it from a local shop.</li>
            <li>it doesnt break me out but it doesnt clear my back ance that i have had since i was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I bought this item actually to add to my all natural pest control mix that I make myself.</li>
            <li>Sorry, I like to be honest with my opinion with my sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>My mom is in her late 50&#x27;s, has some dark spots, and says this helps keep her skin young, takes them away a bit, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I use this product together with Shea Moisture African Black Soap, when taking my morning shower; first the soap &amp; shower, then this body wash and shower.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me, but this one smells like Play-Doh for whatever that information is worth.</li>
            <li>***, very disappointed because it&#x27;s definitly not the same the aroma and texture is all different and my freakin body acne is back currently looking for a new product, when a product is perfect</li>
            <li>in my opinion, this Nubian Heritage soap feels, works, and smells exactly the same as the Shea Moisture African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After reading about all the positive attributes of African black soap, I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>It has helped to clear the skin issues and has not been drying or irritating like many other products advertised for acne.</li>
            <li>Co. I am pre-diabetic with very dry, sensitive and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the ones I purchased from amazon were a little shy on the jojoba beads that I love so much.</li>

            <li> I LOVE the feel of this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the bar version is my favorite soap, so i thought i would try this liquid body wash.</li>
            <li> it is everything the bar is and more.</li>
            <li> It works on pimples, yeast problems on the skin and much more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nubian Heritage.</li>
            <li> Love this product started using it when I had a psoriasis outbreak and now use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great smell and isn&#x27;t drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this item for my bath.</li>
            <li> I love it for them.</li>
            <li> we haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I still love this soap.</li>
            <li> and I must say I now love the body wash as much as I love the lotion.</li>
            <li> The wash is also more like a jelly like consistency</li>
            <li> The body wash smells wonderful, and would leave your skin smelling the same.</li>
            <li> I love this soap but it is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> And this soap has been my most salvating weapon towards the stubborn acne on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I tried it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than the phisoderm I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> It works better than the body wash</li>
            <li> I love the sultry smell and how my skin glows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it is helping my acne</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more!!</li>
            <li> It has a very distinctive and pleasant aroma as well, and as a man I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light licorice scent that makes the shower enjoyable but doesn&#x27;t stay with you all day, which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pea sized amount is good for your whole face.</li>
            <li> At the beginning the smell was awesome to us,but after the burn we believe either it is due to fragrance or either and the foaming agent.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, inoffensive, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> we love how it makes you feel clean and if you have acne or eczema</li>
            <li> It has a strong colone smell...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong though, so perhaps not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> The bar seems too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a process to make sure I get the full benefits of the soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked how it really lathered, and it smelled very sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of body washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about 2 weeks now and am already a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your skin silky smooth and soft, but it also leaves skin with the most wonderful scent for hours!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, I just can&#x27;t help but enjoy the way it looks....</li>
            <li> really fantastic-</li>
            <li> I completely enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, but I follow up my routine with the proper moisture care after</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it runs out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-</li>
            <li> The spots are perfectly round, perfectly lined up polka dots about a 3/4 cm in diameter each.  </li>
            <li> The SM soap used to available at Target for about $10</li>
            <li> They both get rid of any acne that I have and make the skin all smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have extreemly sensitive fair skin and have had no problems with the soap or lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves skin feeling soft and bump free.</li>
            <li> leaves skin smelling good, soft, and clean....</li>
            <li> It worth every penny !</li>
            <li> I would like it to be more consistent.</li>
            <li> I use an amount about the size of my pinky nail on a loofah and get a nice lather that leaves my whole body feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> They rinse clean, yet keep the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean without the film.</li>
            <li> Phisoderm does a a good job but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> Nice soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is... not a bad one.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin super soft and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> and there ingredients were very precise and simple until one day I was in need of more and decided to order some</li>
            <li> Took look at the ingredients and my eyes quickly focused on the &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Luckily i found this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural, certified organic, and vegan/cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference if I&#x27;m being completely honest.</li>
            <li> good thing is that it lasts a long time so even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey</li>
            <li> Our new favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> After using this, you need a good moisturizer because letting your skin dry out will break you out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lather is wonderful, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my skin feels alittle bit dry after use.</li>
            <li> does the job to get my whole body clean and it feels clean as I wash.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help much, but this stuff has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my back already as well as my skin seems to be evening out and has more fullness and life to it.</li>
            <li> And it smells like a light baby powder so its really refreshi</li>
            <li> Also, bars of soap kind of gross me out.</li>
            <li> this is great to help clear it up topically.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell and helped relieve the psoriasis itch.</li>
            <li> i hope the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten very positive comments on how I smell now that I am using the product.</li>
            <li> It will leave your skin clean, soft, and smooth for days.</li>
            <li> My skin is left smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this exact bottle of body wash from my local vitamin store &amp; fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find here in Indiana, so I was happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> While using them, they have all lathered pretty well.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel soft and smooth..</li>
            <li> All natural, exfoliating, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth without a soapy residue after rinsing off.</li>
            <li> my first go around with</li>
            <li> It helped with my acne (face &amp; back) and I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash; and I have stated that personally to Nubian Heritage,</li>
            <li> would most definitely recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li> and it really works !</li>
            <li> However, my acne is pretty hormonal</li>
            <li> but my back have breakouts all the time and its not the most atractive.</li>
            <li> ~~Thanks!</li>
            <li> I find I keep reordering this one in spite of the stash of higher end body washes I have.</li>
            <li> When the sensitivity first started and I hadn&#x27;t figured out what was causing it,</li>
            <li> but they actually make my skin feel better.  </li>
            <li> It was a smooth, sudsy soap, but it did little to reduce my bacne.&lt;br /&gt;Before that, I used Neutrogena Grapefruit Body Wash to treat my acne, and it worked splendidly, but I have been very faithful to natural/organic hygiene for the last year</li>
            <li> The fact that this product can clear up acne and keep skin moisturized at the same time is amazing to me.</li>
            <li> have simply not been able to find a whole lot of body washes targeted at body acne.</li>
            <li> Nubian heritage black soap leaves my skin feeling amazing</li>
            <li> I have mild hyperpigmentation and wondered if this would help clear it up...</li>
            <li> I washed my face and shoulders with it after a light workout and the next day had a lot of pimples on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> My problem with that was they were very inconsistant in having it in stock.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li> (I am always getting comments on how soft my hands are now despite the fact that I rarely apply any lotion).</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are very upset &amp; the face is still burning with ice packs.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> Much too drying for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, very sudsy but doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  </li>
            <li> The spots don&#x27;t itch really, but just looks like it might start to one day if I didn&#x27;t make</li>
            <li> After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will always keep a bottle of this handy because it makes my skin softer than anything else has in the last ten years!</li>
            <li> Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> just wish u guys would go back to how it originally was</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell that is not too feminine and not too masculine (perfect for both my boyfriend and myself) that lingers on your skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried bath and body works products and while the smell good, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything changing with the products they say improve skin, however I still use the products in combination with the African Black Soap Lotion.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it comes to body washes, Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture black soaps are my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually quite content just using a bit of shampoo or whatever is handy.  </li>
            <li> While it does a decent job of cleansing while not stripping moisture from my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would and probably will recommend this product to my friends and family and plan on purchasing more in the future when I need to.</li>
            <li> Overall, the benefits that I&#x27;ve already seen combined with the company&#x27;s healthy and sustainable practices are enough to make me say that I will probably never try anything else!  </li>
            <li> The shop was charging several dollars more for the same product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the particular batch or what.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few natural products that I could find that has no coconut in it and is still effective.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes this soap in particular.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I can use on my super allergy-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using this with the creamy lotion as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and gooey, lathers up quickly and easily, and i don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> really helps sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my skin, and also moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used this on my face because I already have a favorite Lush product, Dark Angels scrub, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works as a face wash.</li>
            <li> especially the raw, pure kind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> He developed eczema on his hand and placed it on for 20 mins, and it was gone!</li>
            <li> It helped with my acne and eczema and made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I love Nubian&#x27;s soap bars too, and usually use those for my face.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend using on infants because its a little strong for there skin.</li>
            <li> and THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THE PRODUCT new packaging</li>
            <li> Would refer to nearly any one, as I have very sensitive skin and acen prone.</li>
            <li> Usually after one lather and rinse I feel smooth when using the other ones, but this never gives that same result no matter how many times I lather and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Soap color is black but lather is rich and plenteous.</li>
            <li> I found it way more drying and hard to keep.</li>
            <li> i was hoping using a natural soap product would help with my ance and maybe clear some of the scars which makes me feel really conscious when wearing sun dresses or tube tops.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and no it doesn&#x27;t help, but I don&#x27;t know any soup or natural product that helps the severity I have.  </li>
            <li> and I suffer from sensitive skin, and eczema.</li>
            <li> I was always trying soaps and washes for moisturizing, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was please with the product and fast delivery,I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Mrs. and daughter use this soap and say it leaves their skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as an adult and used it on my toddler age 4.</li>
            <li> Once I rinse the soap off there is no heavy soap residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> so much, when using just a tiny amount of soap.</li>
            <li> I switched over to NH-ABBW and my skin is so soft and stays moisturized.</li>
            <li> think I will be using this until I see another natural soap targeted for body acne.</li>
            <li> i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> started having really sensitive skin since about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I even tried the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stuff too (Aveno, Jergens natural, Olay natural,</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the fragrance is strong enough to stay with you for a little while but is far from being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Label read EXACTLY the same, but soap was NOT the same.</li>
            <li> overall, i highly recommend this soap product anyway.</li>
            <li> a whole bunch of new ingredients and chemicals they freaking took out the main ingredient \\&quot;AFRICAN BLACK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make this product seem bad, however the facts are more important .Ask</li>
            <li> It has also already helped clear up breakouts on my upper back and arms from the intense summer heat and has seemed to improve the overall feel and texture of my skin</li>
            <li> You feel clean after using it but it does not feel heavy and layered like regular soaps</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming on my skin either, its just right!</li>
            <li> I have been using the African Black Body wash for a while now, but I was originally buying it from a local shop.</li>
            <li> it doesnt break me out but it doesnt clear my back ance that i have had since i was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I bought this item actually to add to my all natural pest control mix that I make myself.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I like to be honest with my opinion with my sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li> My mom is in her late 50&#x27;s, has some dark spots, and says this helps keep her skin young, takes them away a bit, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I use this product together with Shea Moisture African Black Soap, when taking my morning shower; first the soap &amp; shower, then this body wash and shower.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me, but this one smells like Play-Doh for whatever that information is worth.</li>
            <li> ***, very disappointed because it&#x27;s definitly not the same the aroma and texture is all different and my freakin body acne is back currently looking for a new product, when a product is perfect</li>
            <li> in my opinion, this Nubian Heritage soap feels, works, and smells exactly the same as the Shea Moisture African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After reading about all the positive attributes of African black soap, I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> It has helped to clear the skin issues and has not been drying or irritating like many other products advertised for acne.</li>
            <li> Co. I am pre-diabetic with very dry, sensitive and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the ones I purchased from amazon were a little shy on the jojoba beads that I love so much.</li>
            <li> i think the black soap is a cool color, but does get messy in the tub as it leave \\&quot;traces\\</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts forever, you only need a small on a sponge for your whole body.</li>
            <li> I will be switching to another scent but unfortunately will have to stay away from the nice smell of the African Black wash.</li>
            <li> My skin is much less irritated by switching to products that are only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend for anyone with skin issues or chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> Over the last few days, I&#x27;ve also noticed that a few rather dark and pronounced stretch marks that I had on my hips have faded significantly, almost to the point that they are no longer visible.</li>
            <li> my husband &amp; I are in agreement that it smells just like the old timey drug store perfumes they would sell called Jovan&#x27;s vanilla musk, plain musk or white musk.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like you&#x27;re going to get more dirty just by putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Its been a long wait, i dont understand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly drying but definitely not fast acting (which I was not expecting it to be).</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so thick, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot, and the soap lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I started using African Black Soap for my face, and it worked so well for me that I looked for a body wash that I could use for my entire body.</li>
            <li> I have slight acne on my upper back</li>
            <li> This product is long lasting; you only need a little to lather.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I usually add some water to the bottle after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to add this chemical to the formulation since the other ingredients are already acne clearing.</li>
            <li> plus it does help soothe my dry skin.</li>
            <li> the have for most of their lives suffer through winter at least partially broken out.</li>
            <li> I use the all natural raw black soap regularly</li>
            <li> so it last longer than watered down runny body wash products.</li>
            <li> Unlike the African Black bar soap, the body wash has salicylic acid in its ingredients.</li>
            <li> we are fans of african black soap but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using African black soap in a bar, and thought to give the liquid version a try.  </li>
            <li> I changed for a minute for another African Black  Soap in a pump</li>
            <li> I use this body wash daily with the Nubian Heritage Black Soap Lotion after my showers.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I searched around and found this Nubian Heritage African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> I popped this little bottle open and idk what I was expecting it to smell like</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a little over a week</li>
            <li> sometimes the bar  can seem rough on your skin, but this eliminates that altogether.</li>
            <li> and then I use a regular brand soap to remove any heavy stuff that may be on my skin and then proceed with the wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and it now has become the only soap I use.  </li>
            <li> Used with the African Black Soap lotion I find my skin is less itchy and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way when used with a puff instead of a washcloth(or just your hand).</li>
            <li> i have gotten it from a local health food store in the past.</li>
            <li> anyone that has ever used the stuff knows that it can be a little harsh and gritty...</li>
            <li> used to scare the sales persons at The Body Shop and Victoria&#x27;s Secret because they would try out a lotion on my hand and then the red spots would suddenly appear.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other black soaps and body washes I have used.  </li>
            <li> Although its the same brand and label, the bottle I purchased from here does not have any (I mean ZERO) exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> The soap is black (of course) and the consistency of the liquid soap is a little thicker than other bodywashes.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I tried the Nubian Heritage black soap in bar form.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; but without the typical coconut</li>
            <li> no, you don&#x27;t have to be black to try these</li>
            <li> Never knew they sold Black Soap in liquid.</li>
            <li> The previous bottle I had was packed with them</li>
            <li> You need to use a lot less than you think.  </li>
            <li> why do companies always have to mess it up</li>
            <li> The liquid soap smells almost the same as the black soap bar, but very hard to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> but hate is a strong word</li>
            <li> it did not, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Has helped a little bit in relieving an itchy skin condition.</li>
            <li> acne on my back is much less worse now.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face.</li>
            <li> but there is none in the ingredient list--am I missing something?</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think dead skin is causing it), so</li>
            <li> I also noticed a few bumps go away after a period of time.</li>
            <li> They always seem too \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smelling, too runny, or just plain unnecessary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just not sure if its warranting the price.</li>
            <li> my wife has used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and not sure if i noticed any difference from SoftSoap Shea Butter liquid soap.</li>
            <li> not sure how that happened.  </li>
            <li> But the consistency is a bit thin compared to their other products.</li>
            <li> The scent itself is hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> I start by exfoliating my skin with hard loofah</li>
            <li> Worked well with hard water.(some assistance from water softener)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The liquid is a bit thick, with a color somewhere between tar and mud...  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t thin out the soap</li>
            <li> My lotion and body wash before were actually irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very bad psoriasis, and this soap ( and lotion from the same company) really help to soothe the worst and painful patches.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin became worse!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> purchased this  product for my dog who suffers from skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> Smells really bad...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The scent alone can drive you crazy !!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed &amp; will not buy this item from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Have been using prescription shampoo for my dog&#x27;s terrible skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Puberty is cruel and heartless.</li>
            <li> Lotions/soaps from the mall were the worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells really bad... It has a strong colone smell... Can&#x27;t use it...</li>
            <li> Smells nice but can be drying if not paired with moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> excellent product moisture, does not stain tub, rinse well, moisturize and excellent smell skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;must buy, even my family enjoyed it...</li>
            <li> I use this product together with Shea Moisture African Black Soap, when taking my morning shower; first the soap &amp; shower, then this body wash and shower.  Have used the product for quite some years.</li>
            <li> will buy again..leaves skin smelling good, soft, and clean....really helps sensitive skin..will but again!</li>
            <li> My mom is in her late 50&#x27;s, has some dark spots, and says this helps keep her skin young, takes them away a bit, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this item actually to add to my all natural pest control mix that I make myself. I opened the cap &amp; it is a good thing that I would not wash with this body soap b/c my husband &amp; I are in agreement that it smells just like the old timey drug store perfumes they would sell called Jovan&#x27;s vanilla musk, plain musk or white musk. I cannot stand the smell of this as it reminds me of a knock-off perfume sold in Flea markets. Sorry, I like to be honest with my opinion with my sense of smell. I cannot stand it but hate is a strong word so I am settling for don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells amazing and leaves no residue. It hasn&#x27;t cured my blemishes, but it has definitely diminished them.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and does clean.  Also, it  cleared up my daughter&#x27;s eczema as advertised. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product is long lasting; you only need a little to lather. It has really helped clear up my skin, and also moisturizes. Would refer to nearly any one, as I have very sensitive skin and acen prone.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing.  i feel like i am on an african safari every time i use it.  i smell better than anyone could ever dream of</li>
            <li> This soap has made my skin softer and has helped my skin to heal from acne. I would highly recommend using this with the creamy lotion as well. I have extreemly sensitive fair skin and have had no problems with the soap or lotion. I plan to continue to use them both. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Believe me when I tell u this body wash use to be the bomb absolutely the best I ever used it cleared up all my body acne and stretch marks and there ingredients were very precise and simple until one day I was in need of more and decided to order some and THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THE PRODUCT new packaging a whole bunch of new ingredients and chemicals they freaking took out the main ingredient \\&quot;AFRICAN BLACK SOAP\\&quot; what type of $***, very disappointed because it&#x27;s definitly not the same the aroma and texture is all different and my freakin body acne is back currently looking for a new product, when a product is perfect why do companies always have to mess it up just wish u guys would go back to how it originally was</li>
            <li> I popped this little bottle open and idk what I was expecting it to smell like but.... I wanna eat it.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I tried the Nubian Heritage black soap in bar form. I found it way more drying and hard to keep. Also, bars of soap kind of gross me out. This stuff, however, is great. A pea sized amount is good for your whole face. Seriously, this stuff is strong. It will leave your skin clean, soft, and smooth for days. After using this, you need a good moisturizer because letting your skin dry out will break you out. I recommend using Alaffia&#x27;s repairing face moisturizer with neem oil. This combination cleared up my skin in about two weeks. As someone who has used aczone, accutane, and retin a, I can tell you that this stuff is the best thing you can use for your skin.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  this soap lathers up real good and feels great on the skin.  i think the black soap is a cool color, but does get messy in the tub as it leave \\&quot;traces\\&quot; around.  the smell and the texture are both good also.  because it&#x27;s so thick, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot, and the soap lasts longer.  does it help with skin conditions?  I have psoriasis, and no it doesn&#x27;t help, but I don&#x27;t know any soup or natural product that helps the severity I have.  overall, i highly recommend this soap product anyway.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from here but not the second time using it. I find this product to be very good. we love how it makes you feel clean and if you have acne or eczema this is great to help clear it up topically. A must have</li>
            <li> Unlike the African Black bar soap, the body wash has salicylic acid in its ingredients. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to add this chemical to the formulation since the other ingredients are already acne clearing. Also, it bars its use for people who don&#x27;t need it for acne clearing but like the smell and the moisturizing like I do.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it lasts a long time so even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey it&#x27;s worth it because a little goes a long way. I will be switching to another scent but unfortunately will have to stay away from the nice smell of the African Black wash.</li>
            <li> my sister put me on to this body wash.  we are fans of african black soap but anyone that has ever used the stuff knows that it can be a little harsh and gritty... especially the raw, pure kind.  this body wash is a great cleanser... it&#x27;s thick and gooey, lathers up quickly and easily, and i don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.  it&#x27;s strong though, so perhaps not for everyone.  i took off two stars for the shipping.  my package came in a raggedy box that wasn&#x27;t even sealed!  i don&#x27;t know how the bottle stayed inside!  the product is great, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This body wash is wonderful!  Not only does it make your skin silky smooth and soft, but it also leaves skin with the most wonderful scent for hours!  I have given this product for gifts and my friends always want to know where I bought it so they can get more..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of body washes. They always seem too \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smelling, too runny, or just plain unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually quite content just using a bit of shampoo or whatever is handy.  It&#x27;s all basically the same, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the fragrance is strong enough to stay with you for a little while but is far from being overpowering.  The scent itself is hard to describe.  It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; but without the typical coconut scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I just can&#x27;t help but enjoy the way it looks.... The liquid is a bit thick, with a color somewhere between tar and mud...  It almost feels like you&#x27;re going to get more dirty just by putting it on.  But once you mix in a bit more water, it lathers up wonderfully and washes away clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice before it started break me out. I workout a lot and need an admi blemish body wash. Phisoderm does a a good job but wanted to try something different. I washed my face and shoulders with it after a light workout and the next day had a lot of pimples on my shoulders. Took look at the ingredients and my eyes quickly focused on the &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34;. It could be something else in the wash but I know Coconut oil breaks my out when I put it in my hair and sweat from my scalp get on my face. Smells really good and lathers well but I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the feel of this soap. It&#x27;s lather is wonderful, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my skin feels alittle bit dry after use.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  While it does a decent job of cleansing while not stripping moisture from my skin.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other black soaps and body washes I have used.  Usually after one lather and rinse I feel smooth when using the other ones, but this never gives that same result no matter how many times I lather and rinse.  However, as I said, it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years. i have gotten it from a local health food store in the past. My problem with that was they were very inconsistant in having it in stock. Label read EXACTLY the same, but soap was NOT the same. will not be ordering it again!!!</li>
            <li> the bar version is my favorite soap, so i thought i would try this liquid body wash. it is everything the bar is and more. sometimes the bar  can seem rough on your skin, but this eliminates that altogether. a little goes a long way when used with a puff instead of a washcloth(or just your hand). great scent and keeps my skin free of blemishes. i use it as a wash and shampoo. really fantastic- if you&#x27;ve never tried these soaps you owe it to yourself to try(and no, you don&#x27;t have to be black to try these, they work for just about any skin type).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using African black soap in a bar, and thought to give the liquid version a try.  The liquid soap smells almost the same as the black soap bar, but very hard to rinse off.  It leaves residue on my body.  I am going back to the bar soap.</li>
            <li> purchased this  product for my dog who suffers from skin allergies.  After one  bath his itching and skin redness have subsided.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema. I put this on him for about 20 mins. for two days, and it was gone...totally. He developed eczema on his hand and placed it on for 20 mins, and it was gone! It works on pimples, yeast problems on the skin and much more. I use it everyday on my face. It does require me to keep my face moisturized, but it works!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nubian Heritage. Every one of their body washes smell great when using in the shower. I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle. For example, some are hydrating, others are aching fighting, and then combinations of various traits. While using them, they have all lathered pretty well. After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me, but this one smells like Play-Doh for whatever that information is worth.</li>
            <li> Love this product started using it when I had a psoriasis outbreak and now use it all the time. It has a fresh smell and helped relieve the psoriasis itch.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with back acne. Great smell and isn&#x27;t drying out my skin too much. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I started using African Black Soap for my face, and it worked so well for me that I looked for a body wash that I could use for my entire body. Luckily i found this product. Amazing.</li>
            <li> The scent is soothing . makes skin feel soft and smooth.. I will buy more of this item for my bath.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this body wash!! Getting ready to order more!!</li>
            <li> Never knew they sold Black Soap in liquid. I was browsing through Amazon and was amazed to find it. The bar seems too strong for my skin. This product is great to use. Very nice smell and makes you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the body wash and I really like the way it smells plus it does help soothe my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! It helped with my acne and eczema and made my skin feel so soft! The bottle lasts forever, you only need a small on a sponge for your whole body. Definitely would recommend for anyone with skin issues or chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> My two boys and I suffer from sensitive skin, and eczema. the have for most of their lives suffer through winter at least partially broken out. I was always trying soaps and washes for moisturizing, and sensitive skin. A friend recommended this and we haven&#x27;t gone back! I love it for them. we haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, I love the smell. I also buy and use the bar soap</li>
            <li> I completely enjoy this product.  I changed for a minute for another African Black  Soap in a pump but I had to use 4x the product w/ no benefits. I will continue to use this one.  One problem you say it has tea tree oil but there is none in the ingredient list--am I missing something?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with acne at all. In fact, my skin became worse! Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> I was please with the product and fast delivery,I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have slight acne on my upper back and I not only wanted to experience what it was like to have clearer skin again, but was also optimistic about firming my skin and helping the appearance of stretch marks. I have only been using this product a little over a week and I can tell a huge difference in my back already as well as my skin seems to be evening out and has more fullness and life to it. I have a process to make sure I get the full benefits of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;  I start by exfoliating my skin with hard loofah and then I use a regular brand soap to remove any heavy stuff that may be on my skin and then proceed with the wash. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot maybe a dime size does the job to get my whole body clean and it feels clean as I wash. I have tried bath and body works products and while the smell good, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything changing with the products they say improve skin, however I still use the products in combination with the African Black Soap Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;  I have seen a lot of people say it dries out their skin, I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, but I follow up my routine with the proper moisture care after so I think that would keep me from experiencing that as well. Overall I would and probably will recommend this product to my friends and family and plan on purchasing more in the future when I need to. Might even try some others. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! And it smells like a light baby powder so its really refreshi</li>
            <li> Mrs. and daughter use this soap and say it leaves their skin soft. Mrs. uses it after exercising to help with gym smell especially on her feet.  She says it helps with body pimples. She uses another soap every night and morning but this is strictly for gym use. She says it does a great  job of getting rid of body order.</li>
            <li> After reading about all the positive attributes of African black soap, I thought I would give this a try. It has a very light, inoffensive, sweet smell. The soap is black (of course) and the consistency of the liquid soap is a little thicker than other bodywashes. While I don&#x27;t dislike it, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin though it&#x27;s only been about a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and teen grand-daughters to help with facial break-outs. None of them want to use anything else for a facial wash since finding this! It has helped to clear the skin issues and has not been drying or irritating like many other products advertised for acne. I have very sensitive skin and I liked it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about 2 weeks now and am already a huge fan. I love that it is natural, certified organic, and vegan/cruelty free. It has a subtle smell that is not too feminine and not too masculine (perfect for both my boyfriend and myself) that lingers on your skin for a long time. I will say that if you&#x27;re used to fruity, &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; body washes, the smell might be a bit off-putting at first, but I find it very pleasant. While $10 a bottle may seem a bit steep, I promise you that this bottle will last forever! I use an amount about the size of my pinky nail on a loofah and get a nice lather that leaves my whole body feeling clean and fresh. It has also already helped clear up breakouts on my upper back and arms from the intense summer heat and has seemed to improve the overall feel and texture of my skin (I am always getting comments on how soft my hands are now despite the fact that I rarely apply any lotion). The fact that this product can clear up acne and keep skin moisturized at the same time is amazing to me. I have not yet used this on my face because I already have a favorite Lush product, Dark Angels scrub, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works as a face wash. Overall, the benefits that I&#x27;ve already seen combined with the company&#x27;s healthy and sustainable practices are enough to make me say that I will probably never try anything else!  Update: Over the last few days, I&#x27;ve also noticed that a few rather dark and pronounced stretch marks that I had on my hips have faded significantly, almost to the point that they are no longer visible. This stuff just keeps getting better!</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves skin feeling soft and bump free. I have used this product as an adult and used it on my toddler age 4. Do not recommend using on infants because its a little strong for there skin. Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the African Black Body wash for a while now, but I was originally buying it from a local shop. The shop was charging several dollars more for the same product. I did notice that the ones I purchased from amazon were a little shy on the jojoba beads that I love so much. Don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the particular batch or what. Regardless, I still love this soap. A little goes a long way, so I usually add some water to the bottle after the first couple of uses. It doesn&#x27;t thin out the soap but it does help it stretch. The smell is wonderful and leaves the hubby sniffing me all day. It cleans and exfoliates, as promised, without drying my skin out.   P.S. I love Nubian&#x27;s soap bars too, and usually use those for my face.</li>
            <li> I use this body wash daily with the Nubian Heritage Black Soap Lotion after my showers. Its a great product! All natural, exfoliating, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth without a soapy residue after rinsing off. Definitely recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> Very nice, my fav. Soap</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was supposed to be great for skin. I have mild hyperpigmentation and wondered if this would help clear it up...it did not, not even a little bit. It smells nice, but it runs out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- Not impressed.</li>
            <li> My mate used to use this lotion and I love love love its scent! I never used the NH body wash before so this was my first go around with is and I must say I now love the body wash as much as I love the lotion. I feel clean after is use it not just smelling good. Once I rinse the soap off there is no heavy soap residue on my skin. My skin is left smooth and clean! The scent is not overwhelming on my skin either, its just right!</li>
            <li> Warning! Some of my Family members burned their faces. I don&#x27;t want to make this product seem bad, however the facts are more important .Ask the seller why this product &#x27;&#x27;foams&#x27;&#x27; so much, when using just a tiny amount of soap. Don&#x27;t get too amazed with the smell. At the beginning the smell was awesome to us,but after the burn we believe either it is due to fragrance or either and the foaming agent.Who knows why it foams like that.&lt;br /&gt;We are very upset &amp; the face is still burning with ice packs.&lt;br /&gt;To the seller: Please post all the ingredients ,not only the ingredients listed on the item.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this exact bottle of body wash from my local vitamin store &amp; fell in love with it. It helped with my acne (face &amp; back) and I really enjoyed the smell. I decided to buy it on Amazon since it was about $4 cheaper per bottle. I see why now... Although its the same brand and label, the bottle I purchased from here does not have any (I mean ZERO) exfoliating beads. The previous bottle I had was packed with them and I think it&#x27;s what works to help get the dirt and make up out of your pores. I am very disappointed &amp; will not buy this item from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I still have not recieved my item. Its been a long wait, i dont understand.  i hope the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few natural products that I could find that has no coconut in it and is still effective.  My husband likes this soap in particular.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t describe how good this stuff is!  I use the all natural raw black soap regularly but I will always keep a bottle of this handy because it makes my skin softer than anything else has in the last ten years!</li>
            <li> Great smell and made with organic ingredients. I use it as both a body wash and facial cleanser. Can be drying if a moisturizer is not used. Good at treating blemish prone skin. The wash is also more like a jelly like consistency so it last longer than watered down runny body wash products.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Much too drying for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference if I&#x27;m being completely honest. Feels good, smell isn&#x27;t too strong. Just not sure if its warranting the price. But I never had problematic skin before.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice smell. I plan to reorder it.  I was hoping to see some improvement of some marks I have on my hip area. Have not seen anything yet but will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Have been using prescription shampoo for my dog&#x27;s terrible skin issues.  It didn&#x27;t help much, but this stuff has helped tremendously!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash; and I have stated that personally to Nubian Heritage, Co. I am pre-diabetic with very dry, sensitive and itchy skin. I&#x27;ve used all of the mainstream soap brands (Dove, Caress, SoftSoap) and all of them left a white film on my skin. I switched over to NH-ABBW and my skin is so soft and stays moisturized. The itchiness and dryness subsided. The body wash smells wonderful, and would leave your skin smelling the same. I tell the company on Facebook that I just can&#x27;t stop smelling myself! That&#x27;s how good the soap&#x27;s scent and moisturizing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely recommend this body wash!</li>
            <li> Simply great on my skin. You feel clean after using it but it does not feel heavy and layered like regular soaps</li>
            <li> This body wash is one-of-its-kind. The scent alone can drive you crazy !! and it really works ! it makes your skin super soft and smelling amazing. It worth every penny ! I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A little pricey for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, very sudsy but doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  I will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap but it is inconsistent. Sometimes it has the exfoliating beads and sometimes it dosent. I would like it to be more consistent.</li>
            <li> Puberty is cruel and heartless. And this soap has been my most salvating weapon towards the stubborn acne on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I have simply not been able to find a whole lot of body washes targeted at body acne. Before I found this, I was using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Peppermint Soap. It was a smooth, sudsy soap, but it did little to reduce my bacne.&lt;br /&gt;Before that, I used Neutrogena Grapefruit Body Wash to treat my acne, and it worked splendidly, but I have been very faithful to natural/organic hygiene for the last year and I do not plan on using Neutrogena again.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at Target, and I had nothing to lose. Boy, am I glad I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;My acne on my back is much less worse now. I still get pimples when I&#x27;m stressed, and my skin is never perfect, but I feel much better using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints: It claims to be a scrub, but it has no noticeable grainy texture. However, my acne is pretty hormonal (I don&#x27;t think dead skin is causing it), so I don&#x27;t feel a need to force exfoliation. The aroma is... not a bad one. It depends how you feel about Play-Doh.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be using this until I see another natural soap targeted for body acne.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Smells great and great for the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very bad psoriasis, and this soap ( and lotion from the same company) really help to soothe the worst and painful patches. It&#x27;s hard to find here in Indiana, so I was happy to find it here on Amazon. It has a very distinctive and pleasant aroma as well, and as a man I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;. It does not. In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten very positive comments on how I smell now that I am using the product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin.  Better than the phisoderm I&#x27;ve tried before.  I like the smell, but it may be a bit manley for women.  This soap also lathers like a pro.  You need to use a lot less than you think.  I&#x27;m a fan - I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> Nubian heritage black soap leaves my skin feeling amazing</li>
            <li> Smells great. But the consistency is a bit thin compared to their other products.</li>
            <li> Our new favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews which is why I purchased it but I haven&#x27;t seen the results that was talked about in the reviews I guess if I purchased another bottle my skin may become clearer.  It does have a nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Has helped a little bit in relieving an itchy skin condition. It works better than the body wash my wife has used in the past.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it leaves your body feeling so soft.i would recommend it to my friends.really great product.</li>
            <li> Lathers beautifully and my skin feels great. Used with the African Black Soap lotion I find my skin is less itchy and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I love the sultry smell and how my skin glows. This is a shower altering experience!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and not sure if i noticed any difference from SoftSoap Shea Butter liquid soap. it doesnt break me out but it doesnt clear my back ance that i have had since i was a teenager. i dont have sensitive skin but my back have breakouts all the time and its not the most atractive. i was hoping using a natural soap product would help with my ance and maybe clear some of the scars which makes me feel really conscious when wearing sun dresses or tube tops. ill give it a couple more months and see what it does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and it now has become the only soap I use.  Leaves your skin feeling fantastic and is great for shaving too!  Product arrived in good condition and quickly.  Very satisfied with the seller. ~~Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this SLS-free body wash!  Nice soft fragrance.  Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft.  Even during allergy season when my skin is especially easily irritated, this body wash does the job with flying colors.  I find I keep reordering this one in spite of the stash of higher end body washes I have.</li>
            <li> I liked how it really lathered, and it smelled very sweet. I also noticed a few bumps go away after a period of time.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a clearing of my back and chest acne after about 2 weeks of daily use. It&#x27;s not overly drying but definitely not fast acting (which I was not expecting it to be). I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it is helping my acne and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, best price</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this soap.  It&#x27;s the only thing I can use on my super allergy-sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m going to describe what happens to my skin, in case there&#x27;s someone with these symptoms out there, he/she could try this soap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started having really sensitive skin since about 10 years ago.  Any type of drugstore soap or lotion (Jergens, Vaseline, Dove) will make red spots appear on my skin almost instantaneously.  The spots are perfectly round, perfectly lined up polka dots about a 3/4 cm in diameter each.  Lotions/soaps from the mall were the worst. When the sensitivity first started and I hadn&#x27;t figured out what was causing it, used to scare the sales persons at The Body Shop and Victoria&#x27;s Secret because they would try out a lotion on my hand and then the red spots would suddenly appear. Yes, I even tried the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stuff too (Aveno, Jergens natural, Olay natural, blah blah)- all of them caused allergic reactions.  The spots don&#x27;t itch really, but just looks like it might start to one day if I didn&#x27;t make changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ten years, I have found four brands that does not cause a reaction- Burt&#x27;s Bees, Nubian Heritage, Shea Moisture, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note I should make at this point- in my opinion, this Nubian Heritage soap feels, works, and smells exactly the same as the Shea Moisture African Black Soap.  The SM soap used to available at Target for about $10 but then they stopped carrying it.  Now, all the stores that carry it sell it for about $30.  That&#x27;s when I searched around and found this Nubian Heritage African Black Soap.  The ingredients look the same.  I might bet it&#x27;s the same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to body washes, Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture black soaps are my absolute favorite.  Not only do they not cause reactions on my skin but they actually make my skin feel better.  They both get rid of any acne that I have and make the skin all smooth.  They rinse clean, yet keep the skin moisturized.  As a bonus surprise, they also got rid of the ingrown hairs i was getting around my knee area- not sure how that happened.  Oh, the smell is great, too.  It&#x27;s a light licorice scent that makes the shower enjoyable but doesn&#x27;t stay with you all day, which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum, I hope they never stop making this stuff and I hope the price of this stuff never goes to $30.  I NEED this soap.  Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> Worked well with hard water.(some assistance from water softener)&lt;br /&gt; Scent is pleasant; not overpowering.Leaves you feeling clean without the film. Soap color is black but lather is rich and plenteous.</li>
            <li> smells good. My skin is much less irritated by switching to products that are only natural ingredients. My lotion and body wash before were actually irritating my skin. This stuff smells so good. If you don&#x27;t find this is a great deal (which it is) and also works wonders for shaving cream, then try their bars of soap.</li>
    </ol>
