            <li>This tweezers are the best I have had ever.</li>
            <li>Very good tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great for &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; purposes.</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a quality product from Tweezerman, and we&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li>A great buy.</li>
            <li>and she says they are great compared to another one she had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks to Amazon these work just as good</li>
            <li>Love the Tweezerman slant tweezer!</li>
            <li>What more can you say!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to grasp the hair and pull it.  </li>
            <li>These are good tweezers, but I&#x27;ve since taken a magnifying glass to my best, old ones and found that they are still available and at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>More words required for a review</li>
            <li>they work better than hers.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Slant Tweezerette to put in our toiletry bag for a long vacation we just went on, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great for compressing hot vaping springs to get them nice and tight.</li>
            <li>These are not as good as the Tweezermans that cost a little more....</li>
            <li>Unlike others the ends come together flat instead of bowing out when more squeezing force is applied.</li>
            <li>Not to knock Tweezerman, but I&#x27;d more highly recommend TRIM slant tweezers for their ability to find, grasp and hold onto really short hairs as you yank &#x27;em out.</li>
            <li>I like these tweezers because they are not too big and are extremely accurate.</li>
            <li>Works well and is very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like this tweezer.  </li>
            <li>The smaller size of it makes is nice for travel, although I do wish that it came in a plastic tube like the smaller size does.  </li>
            <li>It still is like new and I use it every day.</li>
            <li>It works better than tweezers I have bought at a store in the past.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it every day for over a month now and the edges are still razor sharp and  clean.</li>
            <li>After trying a half dozen different tweezers over the years, these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>works well; wish there was a little rubber circle to put on the end to keep the tines together and clean.</li>
            <li>Works really well, and has stayed sharp.</li>

            <li> Works really well, and has stayed sharp.</li>
            <li> They are precise, taking even the very thin hairs aways.</li>
            <li> I knew that these tweezers were made overseas by the quality of them very cheesy and thin metal!!The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it one star was that they did tweeze just make sure if you order these that you don&#x27;t have arthrittus in your fingers or adult fingers</li>
            <li> Very sharp tip as well.</li>
            <li> They manage to get tiny hairs when plucking, and hard to get splinters out of crying, wiggly, little boy&#x27;s knees.</li>
            <li> I bought this tweezer a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what all of the hype is about.  </li>
            <li> If ya know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The precision end aids in grabbing very small items.</li>
            <li> Pointy tip and very gripy grabbing area makes these work wonders for ripping out that unibrow that you always hated as a kid.</li>
            <li> Pull hair without cutting it.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a knock-off, it&#x27;s a bad ass knock-off</li>

            <li> Great for &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; purposes. If ya know what I mean. More words required for a review and I have nothing to say.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what all of the hype is about.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the cheaper ones I get a CVS.</li>
            <li> works well; wish there was a little rubber circle to put on the end to keep the tines together and clean.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as the Tweezermans that cost a little more....</li>

            <li> Pointy tip and very gripy grabbing area makes these work wonders for ripping out that unibrow that you always hated as a kid. Girlfriend is jealous cause they work better than hers.</li>

            <li> Great for compressing hot vaping springs to get them nice and tight.</li>
            <li> Works really well, and has stayed sharp.</li>
            <li> Does not come in commercial package, just showed up in a baggie. If it&#x27;s a knock-off, it&#x27;s a bad ass knock-off cause it&#x27;s flawless. Have been using it every day for over a month now and the edges are still razor sharp and  clean.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  What more can you say!</li>
            <li> I really like this tweezer.  It works better than tweezers I have bought at a store in the past.  It is very easy to grasp the hair and pull it.  I would recommend this tweezer.</li>
            <li> Great. Pull hair without cutting it. Unlike others the ends come together flat instead of bowing out when more squeezing force is applied. Very sharp tip as well.</li>

            <li> Would not hold on to eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> This tweezers are the best I have had ever. They are precise, taking even the very thin hairs aways. A great buy.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers, but I&#x27;ve since taken a magnifying glass to my best, old ones and found that they are still available and at a lower price.

            <li> All I can say is I ordered these for my wife and she says they are great compared to another one she had.</li>
            <li> I like these tweezers because they are not too big and are extremely accurate.</li>
