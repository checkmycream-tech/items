            <li>I broke the one I had and never thought I would be able to replace it.</li>
            <li>For a close buzz, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly with my Wahl product and it is lasting longer than the original one did that came with the Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>This is significantly more secure than the attachment I got with the clipper.</li>
            <li>Also seems to be made out of a more flexible plastic than the original that came with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This replace seems better than the original attachment.  </li>
            <li>it is better than the one that came with it when I originally brought it</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to have to buy the full set just to get this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to fined the exact attachment I required..</li>
            <li>It fits fine, just like he one that came with the clipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks to be fine quality and trimmed up my beard just fine.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit my trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Its a cheap piece of plastic</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a cheap clone</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li>Broke my original guide when I dropped the cutter.  </li>
            <li>This one fits snugly and works just like the original.  </li>
            <li>My original broke.  </li>
            <li>It looks and works as well as the original.</li>
            <li>This #1 attachment is exactly like the original!</li>
            <li>Good for a real short haircut!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, and it shipped quickly and arrived in fine shape.  </li>
            <li>fit right onto my clippers and was exactly what i need after i broke my original guide.</li>
            <li>Since I cut my own hair and needed this size only, it was better than throwing the whole Wahl trimmer away.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Now my short haircuts are much easier to do and look good.</li>
            <li>Snapped right onto my Wahl trimmer that I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also made a little thicker and stronger ... more durable for sure ...</li>
            <li>Thinking one of the kiddos tossed the original comb by accident and this was well worth the price since our Wahl clippers were new.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price also.  </li>
            <li>It shipped pretty fast too!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed after I lost my #1 at work.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Fits my cheap Vidal Sassoon clippers a bit loose, but still functions fine.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>After a few months, it&#x27;s still effective.  </li>
            <li>This is the only comb I use on my 2 dogs and they have destroyed the one that came with the original</li>
            <li>I have an older Wahl Home Cut model.</li>
            <li>brand new in plastic</li>
            <li>Finally an actual whal guard and not some off brand generic guard that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Wanted to have a second one just in case the first one broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little wider than the one I had before, but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>My Wahl is about 20 years old.</li>
            <li>This works just like the old one.  </li>
            <li>It is just like the old one in every way.</li>
            <li>One haircut so far.</li>
            <li>nice replacement for my broken onel</li>
            <li>Looks to be a slightly different material (or different manufacturing process) than the original one that came with my clippers (that mysteriously disappeared) but it clips on properly.</li>
            <li>I am only replacing it because I lost my old one.</li>

            <li> My original broke.  I was unsure of where to get a replacement.  Of course Amazon carries everything.  :).  This works just like the old one.  Very reasonable price also.  Would buy again.</li>

            <li> Its a cheap piece of plastic but it does its job. i though the clippers built on length adjust was enough but it cut me bald both times so i got this comb / guard. now i get a short but not too short cut that a want.</li>
            <li> Great quality, no defects, shipped on time. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and it shipped quickly and arrived in fine shape.  Not sure why, as it seems to have the same dimensions as the comb I had before, but now I&#x27;m finding that I have some skin occasionally being nicked by the metal blades as I trim my goatee.</li>
            <li> Was as stated and works as expected</li>
            <li> This #1 attachment is exactly like the original! Since I cut my own hair and needed this size only, it was better than throwing the whole Wahl trimmer away.</li>

            <li> It works. A little pricey.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Would buy from the seller again, I&#x27;m very happy with Wahl&#x27;s quality.  I am only replacing it because I lost my old one.</li>
