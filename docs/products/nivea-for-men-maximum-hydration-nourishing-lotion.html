    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent value and wonderful fragrance too.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product from Nivea!!</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Which is great!</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>I have found balms and corn huskers lotion to be the best solution for weathered skin.</li>
            <li>One thing that would make this perfect would be some SPF protection.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to put on my face after washing it and this works great.</li>
            <li>and my brother loved it.</li>
            <li>Good experience  </li>
            <li>so I go with what she brings home because it&#x27;s free and supposedly the best.</li>
            <li>Good smell and feel.</li>
            <li>There are good types of alcohol for your skin and harmful types for your skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion is the of light thickness and OK smell, and is the best men&#x27;s lotion which can be bought in bulk.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>the effect is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Percect solution for men who want to have nice skin, but sont want to use moisterizers marketed for women.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, manly scent, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and my husband like to use it.</li>
            <li>This product has a decent smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing, and best of all does not leave a greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>I felt the scent to be very strong that i had to take another shower.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing manly smell, and leaves the skin feeling VERY smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is great lotion for the whole body</li>
            <li>Check the grocery store for better prices.</li>
            <li>Bought this not knowing if it would be much better that the others I use in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried it once and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea is my favorite lotion, and the Nivea for Men solidified this even more --</li>
            <li>Anyhow, my wife seems pleased that she is no longer walking out with someone who has skin like an elephant&#x27;s hide, so I guess it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like being able to use it also on my face, instead of a separate product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my husband likes the multi purpose.</li>
            <li>Like MANY OF YOU WE HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCT</li>
            <li>A better selection at Amazon..</li>
            <li>Thank you, Nivea!!! :)</li>
            <li>Got a couple more bottles of it.</li>
            <li>Best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has a great clean scent, not feminine or overwhelmingly masculine.</li>
            <li>I bought the Nivea for Men after getting a free trail in one of my marathon packs and saw how much my son liked it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s not oily which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and the scent appeared to be light</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s another great lotion from Nivea.</li>
            <li>My wife works in cosmetics for Bloomindales and she always gets free samples of super-expensive lotions (Clarins, Dior, Chanel, etc).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good my skin felt after one use.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and moisturizes all day long.</li>
            <li>-- I originally rated this product 3/5 stars because of the absorption rate of the lotion.</li>
            <li>In fact, believe that Nivea&#x27;s products are overall fantastic, and have been using the original in the blue tin with excellent results for years.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this lotion is pretty good so far</li>
            <li>Sickeningly sweet - it made me gag.</li>
            <li>No more ashyness! :D</li>
            <li>Found the lotion to be quite watery and form someone who works outside and had cracked dry hands, it was not the best fit.</li>
            <li>Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  </li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it absorbs quickly on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a believer of high cost &#x3D; better product, but she is</li>
            <li>It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky or greasy feeling</li>
            <li>post shaving men need something to calm their face.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed by your skin and does not leave an oily film or residue.</li>
            <li>He was using my lotions to combat his perpetual dryness, but they had a distinctly feminine smell.</li>
            <li>-- It does a good job of moisturizing dry skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love NIVEA moisturizers (and lip balms!) and wanted to get something for a guy with very dry skin</li>
            <li>Makes my dry hands feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and his skin isn&#x27;t looking so dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this very much.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous lotions over the years living in dry climates and this one is b far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>This has actually gone to help provide a more permanent solution.</li>
            <li>so the next time I will order more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it does..</li>
            <li>i got a sample of this on the back of another nivea produst and fell in love as soon as i put it on my face.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully with such a small amount.</li>
            <li>After just 3 days his skin feels so much softer!</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizing lotion that I use everyday.</li>
            <li>A few days of applying the nivea my hands have never felt and looked so good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and not strong.</li>
            <li>clean masculine smell without being overpowering</li>
            <li>This was a total impulse buy, and the second I tried it I loved it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; clearly no longer flies with the fairer sex of today&#x27;s society who require a more rounded or, dare I say it, gentler man.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty fast and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>this product seems to be a good everyday, general moisturizing lotion to keep your skin looking healthy and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t work well if you suffer from extreme dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it keeps skin feeling soft and moisturized, but it&#x27;s not wet feeling when you put it on</li>
            <li>\\&quot;no go\\&quot; for use over large skin</li>
            <li>It would make a good gift for men who are hard to buy for.</li>
            <li>I thought this one describes the product very well&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I would go for something else if your skin is very dry/red/cracked/irritated,</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product and made it part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nivea for keeping my skin from cracking apart.</li>
            <li>: Easy to use, goes a long way, works</li>
            <li>Other than the cologne-like smell this lotion carries, really unsure how it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like it as It&#x27;s hard to find a Men&#x27;s Lotion that actually has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>The Nivea for Men is the same quick drying but moisturizing formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend this product, especially if the love of your life is casting disparaging looks at your facial skin tone!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But i highly doubt that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, for those who are as naive to this new man personal care paradigm as I was/am the most important comment I will make</li>
            <li>That takes me to the next point, when the lotion is first applied, it feels pretty greasy and has a light shine to it and this lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li>it has helped smooth his skin and make it less irritable after  shaving</li>
            <li>Other reviews say it has a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; smell and that just isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>The smell is light &amp; fresh and is not very strong like some other lotions are so</li>
            <li>It feels soft on the skin and does what it&#x27;s meant to.</li>
            <li>Nivea for Men Maximum Hydration is a gel/lotion formulation and, even though currently have rashy skin, upon application this was very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Actually, recently had opportunity to try a L&#x27;Occitane lotion with15% shea butter that commands a price over FOUR the cost of this, and it really irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>: Pricey, seems to attack my innate sense of manliness, but then that&#x27;s just being \\&quot;old fashioned\\</li>
            <li>(masculine breezy scent) and the hand pump is so helpful.</li>
            <li>In 1 Moisturizer Body to refresh dry tired skin everyday to make you happy!</li>
            <li>A little dab goes a long way and this stuff dries quickly!</li>
            <li>, I have set this container on the bathroom sink and started to use this as part of my \\&quot;daily routine\\&quot;, or what we used to call \\&quot;a wash and shave\\&quot; in the old days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess if this is the only lotion that you have ever tried, then it will seem like it absorbs rather quickly, however, I have tried other lotions that absorb much faster with a less greasy feel.</li>
            <li>However, the original cream is thick as paste, so a decided</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely feminine and absolutely the furthest thing from a male smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff is full of water and leaves your skin so dry and pale that you wonder why it&#x27;s still on the maarket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I feel my masculinity has now been challenged, I have reluctantly come to acknowledge that what was previously marketed as \\&quot;the rugged look\\&quot; for men of \\&quot;a certain age\\</li>

            <li> I guess if this is the only lotion that you have ever tried, then it will seem like it absorbs rather quickly, however, I have tried other lotions that absorb much faster with a less greasy feel.</li>
            <li> However, the original cream is thick as paste, so a decided</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely feminine and absolutely the furthest thing from a male smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is full of water and leaves your skin so dry and pale that you wonder why it&#x27;s still on the maarket.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I feel my masculinity has now been challenged, I have reluctantly come to acknowledge that what was previously marketed as \\&quot;the rugged look\\&quot; for men of \\&quot;a certain age\\</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who has somewhat dry skin, but not extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 / 5 stars only because, it takes a little bit of time to completely absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> I was never much of a lotion user due to the fact that I do not like the greasy feeling that most moisturizers leave behind.  </li>
            <li> ,it does take a few minutes to absorb completely but not that long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit that after a few days of this simple routine the skin on my face feels much less dry (or I guess to use modern parlance, \\&quot;has achieved optimal hydration\\&quot;, or somesuch other marketing gibberish).</li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issue with dry skin for a while, and multiple other products worked... for a day or so.</li>

            <li> My boyfriend was always complaining about his face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It does help with his dry skin.</li>

            <li> I have suffered from very dry skin for years.</li>

            <li> Normally when I apply those expensive lotions I can&#x27;t even open a door knob</li>
            <li> and it lasts as long as it says it does - no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> This has definitely improved the softness level of hard palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HATE the feeling of most lotions, cannot stand the smell, or deal with the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> So much better than the Vaseline crap I had before.</li>

            <li> He goes to the gym to lift weights almost every day, and the result was hard, dry, callused palms.</li>
            <li> Try mixing with a few drops of olive oil (grapeseed or jojob oil) for face application.  </li>
            <li> It hurt mine and dried it out.  </li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for me after having casually stated that my skin \\&quot;looked like a walnut\\&quot;, presumably due to the time I spend outside in the winter weather in Pennsylvania, although I didn&#x27;t investigate too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After shaving I pump a SMALL AMOUNT into the palm of one hand, dab it on a couple of places my face and rub it in.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Nivia for a couple ears and I saw iit on Amazon and decided to buy the combination package here. It is great lotion for the whole body and I would recommend it to my friends. It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing lotion that I use everyday. It does not feel sticky nor does it have a scent. It feels soft on the skin and does what it&#x27;s meant to. No more ashyness! :D</li>
            <li> Percect solution for men who want to have nice skin, but sont want to use moisterizers marketed for women.  Leaves skin nice and moist without being greasy. With a slight manly scent, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, without any greasy feeling after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issue with dry skin for a while, and multiple other products worked... for a day or so. This has actually gone to help provide a more permanent solution.</li>
            <li> I stopped by Walgreens and picked this up because it was on sale. I opened it up and the scent appeared to be light but after I purchased it, went home, took a shower, and applied to my body I felt the scent to be very strong that i had to take another shower. It&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of research when buying stuff except for something like this but after getting this i started to look for reviews. I thought this one describes the product very well&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> i gave this item as a gift and my brother loved it. it has helped smooth his skin and make it less irritable after  shaving</li>
            <li> Has a perfume-y, feminine smell to it.  As soon as my wife smelled it she said it smelled like woman&#x27;s lotion; I agree.  In fact, just writing this review the smell is making me nauseous.  If you&#x27;re a man and want to smell like a woman you should buy this.</li>
            <li> The lotion is the of light thickness and OK smell, and is the best men&#x27;s lotion which can be bought in bulk.  Check the grocery store for better prices.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and moisturizes all day long. I really like it as It&#x27;s hard to find a Men&#x27;s Lotion that actually has a great smell to it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a total impulse buy, and the second I tried it I loved it.  Didn&#x27;t even know this was meant for men, nor do I care honey!  In fact, believe that Nivea&#x27;s products are overall fantastic, and have been using the original in the blue tin with excellent results for years.  However, the original cream is thick as paste, so a decided \\&quot;no go\\&quot; for use over large skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Nivea for Men Maximum Hydration is a gel/lotion formulation and, even though currently have rashy skin, upon application this was very soothing.  No irritation whatsoever.  That&#x27;s probably because post shaving men need something to calm their face.  And it&#x27;s a three way deal too  &amp; can be used on face, body and hands.  Men are practical (so am I) and don&#x27;t buy different creams for every part of their face or  body.  Never bought into that concept either.  Eye cream?  Nah.  Actually, recently had opportunity to try a L&#x27;Occitane lotion with15% shea butter that commands a price over FOUR the cost of this, and it really irritated my skin.  You do the math folks.  Which am I going to reach for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value and wonderful fragrance too.  Try mixing with a few drops of olive oil (grapeseed or jojob oil) for face application.  Moisturization is longlasting too.  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this stuff works for moisturizing or not because I couldn&#x27;t take the smell. Sickeningly sweet - it made me gag. Other reviews say it has a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; smell and that just isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s extremely feminine and absolutely the furthest thing from a male smell.</li>
            <li> I must say that this lotion is pretty good so far -- It does a good job of moisturizing dry skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. I gave this product 3 / 5 stars only because, it takes a little bit of time to completely absorb into the skin. I guess if this is the only lotion that you have ever tried, then it will seem like it absorbs rather quickly, however, I have tried other lotions that absorb much faster with a less greasy feel. That takes me to the next point, when the lotion is first applied, it feels pretty greasy and has a light shine to it and this lasts for a little while. The smell is light &amp; fresh and is not very strong like some other lotions are so I guess that is a plus when using this. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who has somewhat dry skin, but not extremely dry. I would go for something else if your skin is very dry/red/cracked/irritated, etc... this product seems to be a good everyday, general moisturizing lotion to keep your skin looking healthy and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t work well if you suffer from extreme dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit*** -- I originally rated this product 3/5 stars because of the absorption rate of the lotion. However, I have been using this lotion for a little while now, and even though it does take a little while to completely absorb and not feel greasy/oily...the effect is simply amazing. It has an amazing manly smell, and leaves the skin feeling VERY smooth and moisturized. Excellent product from Nivea!! 5/5!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this not knowing if it would be much better that the others I use in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;With the fall around the corner it will get a lot of use . I have tried it once and love it. Wife approved !</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. It has a great clean scent, not feminine or overwhelmingly masculine. Makes my dry hands feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Nivea for Men after getting a free trail in one of my marathon packs and saw how much my son liked it. He likes tgus lotion he&#x27;s a teenager and doesn&#x27;t spend any time on taking care of his skin. He likes it because all he has to do is put it on after a shower and it last all day. It smells nice, and his skin isn&#x27;t looking so dry.</li>
            <li> I love NIVEA moisturizers (and lip balms!) and wanted to get something for a guy with very dry skin so thought I&#x27;ll give this a try.  Other than the cologne-like smell this lotion carries, really unsure how it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; oriented.  I thought maybe it&#x27;s made with different chemicals for the thicker-skinned males of our species?  But i highly doubt that.  Overall, it&#x27;s another great lotion from Nivea.</li>
            <li> I always use it after bathing for feet, legs, arms, hands. It is absorbed by your skin and does not leave an oily film or residue.</li>
            <li> Good experience  Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  [...]</li>
            <li> My wife works in cosmetics for Bloomindales and she always gets free samples of super-expensive lotions (Clarins, Dior, Chanel, etc). I&#x27;m not a believer of high cost &#x3D; better product, but she is so I go with what she brings home because it&#x27;s free and supposedly the best. If it doesn&#x27;t work then I just assumed it&#x27;s because I have death valley dry skin that can&#x27;t get repaired. A few months ago I randomly went to a CVS and picked up a bottle of this Nivea lotion for my desk at work because my knuckles were so chapped that I almost went to see a doc. A few days of applying the nivea my hands have never felt and looked so good. It doesn&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s not oily which is a huge plus. Normally when I apply those expensive lotions I can&#x27;t even open a door knob so I end up washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a reason price, I believe the bottle 17oz bottle cost me $9.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was always complaining about his face feeling dry. But it wasn&#x27;t just his face. He goes to the gym to lift weights almost every day, and the result was hard, dry, callused palms. He was using my lotions to combat his perpetual dryness, but they had a distinctly feminine smell. This wasn&#x27;t a big deal to him, but when I found out about the Nivea for Men line, I instantly picked up a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic. It&#x27;s a nice, manly scent, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I love that it keeps skin feeling soft and moisturized, but it&#x27;s not wet feeling when you put it on (I hate having to wait for a lotion to dry). The Nivea for Men is the same quick drying but moisturizing formula. Put it on and be on your way. Which is great! This has definitely improved the softness level of hard palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is my favorite lotion, and the Nivea for Men solidified this even more -- I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for me after having casually stated that my skin \\&quot;looked like a walnut\\&quot;, presumably due to the time I spend outside in the winter weather in Pennsylvania, although I didn&#x27;t investigate too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I feel my masculinity has now been challenged, I have reluctantly come to acknowledge that what was previously marketed as \\&quot;the rugged look\\&quot; for men of \\&quot;a certain age\\&quot; clearly no longer flies with the fairer sex of today&#x27;s society who require a more rounded or, dare I say it, gentler man. So, begrudgingly I have to to admit, I have set this container on the bathroom sink and started to use this as part of my \\&quot;daily routine\\&quot;, or what we used to call \\&quot;a wash and shave\\&quot; in the old days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, for those who are as naive to this new man personal care paradigm as I was/am the most important comment I will make is USE SPARINGLY. This stuff goes a long way! After shaving I pump a SMALL AMOUNT into the palm of one hand, dab it on a couple of places my face and rub it in. Anything left on my hands I then rub into the palms and backs too. It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky or greasy feeling that I though it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that after a few days of this simple routine the skin on my face feels much less dry (or I guess to use modern parlance, \\&quot;has achieved optimal hydration\\&quot;, or somesuch other marketing gibberish). Anyhow, my wife seems pleased that she is no longer walking out with someone who has skin like an elephant&#x27;s hide, so I guess it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, goes a long way, works&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey, seems to attack my innate sense of manliness, but then that&#x27;s just being \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; I guess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product, especially if the love of your life is casting disparaging looks at your facial skin tone!</li>
            <li> This stuff is full of water and leaves your skin so dry and pale that you wonder why it&#x27;s still on the maarket.</li>
            <li> I like being able to use it also on my face, instead of a separate product. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my husband likes the multi purpose. It does help with his dry skin. Even our daughter likes the smell (its manly).</li>
            <li> Like MANY OF YOU WE HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCT I like this one a lot. so the next time I will order more. A better selection at Amazon..</li>
            <li> This product works great! Exactly what it says it does..it does..buy it! I was pleasantly surprised how good my skin felt after one use.</li>
            <li> i got a sample of this on the back of another nivea produst and fell in love as soon as i put it on my face. clean masculine smell without being overpowering,it does take a few minutes to absorb completely but not that long. I enjoy using this product and made it part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it absorbs quickly on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from very dry skin for years. Bought this lotion in hopes of helping stop the dryness and irritation. Found the lotion to be quite watery and form someone who works outside and had cracked dry hands, it was not the best fit. I have found balms and corn huskers lotion to be the best solution for weathered skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous lotions over the years living in dry climates and this one is b far the best I have found. I HATE the feeling of most lotions, cannot stand the smell, or deal with the greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t experience any of that with this lotion. A little dab goes a long way and this stuff dries quickly! No greasy residue and it lasts as long as it says it does - no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with such a small amount. Good smell and feel. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was never much of a lotion user due to the fact that I do not like the greasy feeling that most moisturizers leave behind.  This product has a decent smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing, and best of all does not leave a greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> Smells good and not strong. Dries pretty fast and not greasy.  I would not eat it, or cook with it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is terrific. So much better than the Vaseline crap I had before. Smells great (masculine breezy scent) and the hand pump is so helpful. One thing that would make this perfect would be some SPF protection.</li>
            <li> I tried to make my hubby to use body  lotion for his dry elbows but it didn&#x27;t work :( So i decided to buy him men&#x27;s lotion and asked him to use it. After just 3 days his skin feels so much softer! Thank you, Nivea!!! :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to put on my face after washing it and this works great. Got a couple more bottles of it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs well</li>
            <li> There are good types of alcohol for your skin and harmful types for your skin. Alcohol Dena, an ingredient in this maximum hydrating lotion.  Alcohol Denat (very similar to rubbing alcohol) is very bad for the skin. It hurt mine and dried it out.  Just saying think twice about this.</li>
            <li> Use Nivea For Men Maximum Hydration 3 In 1 Moisturizer Body to refresh dry tired skin everyday to make you happy!</li>
            <li> This product is grat for men with dry skin conditions.  I would recommend this very much.  I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and my husband like to use it. It would make a good gift for men who are hard to buy for.</li>
            <li> Keeping the skin hydrated while in Afghanistan is a tough job.  Thanks Nivea for keeping my skin from cracking apart.</li>
