    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They are great for nails and home crafts.  </li>
            <li>The sellers are very nice</li>
            <li>This mini ball beads are the best complement I could ever buy to decorate my nails, I use it with wvwrything, regular nails, nail art, 3D nail art, theyÂ´re just awesome.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>Better packaging needed.</li>
            <li>I use them to decorate many things.</li>
            <li>, thought there would be a lot more</li>
            <li>maybe you will do better.</li>
            <li>but its okay for the price and the size.</li>
            <li>I was so excited not just for the price</li>
            <li>Nota pone color os completely on its own.</li>
            <li>The jars are great for little crafts ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>i didnt read it right, but it is mini ball beads.</li>
            <li>Loved the balls however, most of the colors had mixed into other sections and some of the colors faded when used on my nails.</li>
            <li>When I received this product most of the colors were all mixed together.</li>
            <li>They are tiny for sure, but affordable and neat colors.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are nice beads</li>
            <li>This probably happened during shipping, but, this also means that the container is not separating them very well.</li>
            <li>and I would probably only be able to fit a pink into one bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very upset</li>
            <li>Also, most of the beads had been jostled during shipping and had landed in other colors.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice, but product is hard to work with.</li>
            <li>While there is obviously not enough product here for a full caviar manicure, you can use these accent beads for either an accent nail or to line a jewel decorating your nails, create a &amp;#34;studded&amp;#34; look, or other creative designs.</li>
            <li>The beads shipped earlier than expected, which was nice.</li>
            <li>, after applying a clear coat the balls lost their colors and turned... silver or grayish.</li>
            <li>When I resived  this product , it was completely mix and sprayed all over the bag , I just trash it .&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Not to mention there&#x27;s not nearly enough to do even a whole hand with let alone</li>
            <li>I was originally going to use them for my nails, and because of the small size of the container</li>
            <li>There were barely any caviar beads.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would try to use it anyway, but there&#x27;s such a color combination that I&#x27;m not likely to use it.</li>
            <li>Use a thick self-leveling topcoat on top of these and only brush over them once, as multiple passes may result in some color bleeding.</li>
            <li>not worth how much it costs</li>
            <li>Complete waste if money all the Beads were mixed in and the colors were not as vibrant as it looked.....</li>

            <li> I was expecting to be able to choose the colors I wanted but it is impossible to separate them now because they cling to each other and the whole wheel mixed together.</li>
            <li> Just got these today, and all the colors were all mixed up in the package, not sorted like in the picture and there were loose balls all inside the package.</li>
            <li> Came in cute little jars, but the black looked like dark green.</li>
            <li> All of the colors were mixed which makes it WAY harder to select the color you want to use.</li>
            <li> I would return but it&#x27;s not worth my time effort or money to send these back.</li>
            <li> I was planning on dipping a wet nail into one bed of beads to create the pearled manicure look.</li>
            <li> the sample is so small its smaller than the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t come with black like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> a wasted of money .</li>
            <li> The wheel I received was broken and did not have 12 different colors.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and couldn&#x27;t even achieve the results I wanted because after turning the lid twice colors were all contaminated.</li>
            <li> This was a mess!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> my case the colors came all mixed up making impossible any other decoration rather than a multicolored</li>
            <li> There were hardly any beads for me to even use.</li>
            <li> the other hand, even if the pearls where correctly assigned, as shown in the photograph, the package is so bad that makes it nearly impossible to use without creating a mess in the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say but that never happened to me with the Ciate</li>
            <li> mad</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Also did not receive bonus, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!  </li>

            <li> Loved the balls however, most of the colors had mixed into other sections and some of the colors faded when used on my nails.</li>
            <li> I was so excited not just for the price but the quality and how gas I received the product! Absolutely amazing and I will be a repeat customer and suggest to others</li>
            <li> Came in cute little jars, but the black looked like dark green. There is only 1 teaspoon per jar, so beware. The jars are great for little crafts ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> While there is obviously not enough product here for a full caviar manicure, you can use these accent beads for either an accent nail or to line a jewel decorating your nails, create a &amp;#34;studded&amp;#34; look, or other creative designs.

            <li> I was so disapointed when i opened my package! All of the balls were mixed. Nota pone color os completely on its own. Better packaging needed.</li>
            <li> This mini ball beads are the best complement I could ever buy to decorate my nails, I use it with wvwrything, regular nails, nail art, 3D nail art, theyÂ´re just awesome.</li>
            <li> They are great for nails and home crafts.  I use them to decorate many things.</li>
            <li> All of the colors were mixed which makes it WAY harder to select the color you want to use. Also, there were a bunch of beads in the package, beads that had gotten out of the wheel. Other than that they are nice beads</li>
            <li> When I resived  this product , it was completely mix and sprayed all over the bag , I just trash it .&lt;br /&gt;What a wasted of money .</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice, but product is hard to work with. Consider using tweezers to place the beads if you want them in a specific spot. I did like the product though.</li>
            <li> They were all mixed up when I got it. I was expecting to be able to choose the colors I wanted but it is impossible to separate them now because they cling to each other and the whole wheel mixed together.</li>
            <li> When I received this product most of the colors were all mixed together. This probably happened during shipping, but, this also means that the container is not separating them very well. Normally, I would try to use it anyway, but there&#x27;s such a color combination that I&#x27;m not likely to use it. (Almost 3 colors are salvageable)</li>
            <li> The product is way smaller than advertised in the pictures. I&#x27;m not talking about the diameter of the pearls, but the size of the container and quantity of product.&lt;br /&gt;In my case the colors came all mixed up making impossible any other decoration rather than a multicolored one.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, even if the pearls where correctly assigned, as shown in the photograph, the package is so bad that makes it nearly impossible to use without creating a mess in the other compartments.&lt;br /&gt;Also, after applying a clear coat the balls lost their colors and turned... silver or grayish. I&#x27;m sorry to say but that never happened to me with the Ciate ones.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus for me were four (4) butterflies. Yes, four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> not worth how much it costs, thought there would be a lot more and it didn&#x27;t come with black like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The beads shipped earlier than expected, which was nice. However, the wheel of beads turned out to be MUCH smaller than it appeared in the pictures. Also, most of the beads had been jostled during shipping and had landed in other colors. I was originally going to use them for my nails, and because of the small size of the container it&#x27;s almost impossible. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Am going for the Martha Stewart brand instead.</li>
            <li> If I could have given a zero I would have should have followed the reviews and not purchased.  Complete waste if money all the Beads were mixed in and the colors were not as vibrant as it looked.....DO NOT BUY YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!  PLEASE change packaging and shipping maybe you will do better. Also did not receive bonus, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted these for a craft, but you can also use them in your manicure. They are tiny for sure, but affordable and neat colors. The sellers are very nice</li>
            <li> When I opened this package, the beads were all mixed together. I was planning on dipping a wet nail into one bed of beads to create the pearled manicure look. I can&#x27;t do that now because all the colors are mixed together. This was a mess! I&#x27;m just going to have to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this wheel is very tiny and I would probably only be able to fit a pink into one bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not going to get this ever again!</li>
            <li> Nothing like getting the package with mini beads all over the inside of the package it came in. There were hardly any beads for me to even use. I got this specifically b/c the colors were separated. And they don&#x27;t stay in the wheel well. At all.</li>
            <li> The wheel I received was broken and did not have 12 different colors. There were barely any caviar beads. I was very upset</li>
            <li> Colors all mix together because of the packaging. mad I wasted my money and couldn&#x27;t even achieve the results I wanted because after turning the lid twice colors were all contaminated. Not to mention there&#x27;s not nearly enough to do even a whole hand with let alone two ugh. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> i didnt read it right, but it is mini ball beads. the sample is so small its smaller than the palm of your hand. i havent used it yet. but its okay for the price and the size.</li>
