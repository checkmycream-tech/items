            <li> I will definitely buy these for my personal use and use the plain old roller balls to give as samples to clients.</li>
            <li> They are not heavy but not light either once you fill it up and put the ball in place.</li>

            <li> Well made, beautiful colors, arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering how to refill it like I have been trying to figure out, it&#x27;s EASY now that I know how!  Just remove the glass bottle from the aluminum casing and the top screws right off.  Now that I figured that out, I LOVE these!</li>
            <li> These are very nice although one of them was cracked when I received it.  Not worth the trouble to return!  I like the fact that it has a metal ball rather than a plastic one.  I will most likely order again in the future.  Maybe I will receive three usable bottles then!!</li>
            <li> Super cute, but the roller ball fell out and it spilled.</li>
            <li> Good quality and love that they are refillable!</li>
            <li> I was looking for roller bottles that did not leak.  These do not leak though the ball is loose.  The manufacturer recommends a 90% solution of carrier oil to essential.  I used about 50%.  I will make a weaker solution next time.</li>
            <li> I really like these roll on bottles. I use them for essential oils. They hold 10 mil of oil (which I think is a lot). The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I wish they came in more colors. Other than that I am perfectly happy with these bottles and will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> love this can make my own blends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these bottles. As someone who uses essential oils everyday; these are quality made. It is very difficult to find metal roller balls.

            <li> Love them and they are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Of the set of 3....one leaked. My most expensive essential oil blend leaked everywhere. The other two worked great though. :/</li>
            <li> I like these roller bottles, specifically because I wanted something with a METAL roller ball. Not plastic. I guess that is why they are a bit more expensive. They are not heavy but not light either once you fill it up and put the ball in place. Refilling will be an interesting challenge. The ball is not in place when you receive the item. You&#x27;ll want to take the white plastic piece out before filling initially ( I used a pair of pliers to pull it out easily). Fill your bottle with whatever your heart desires. I put my own blends in them with some carrier oils (I have a sleepy time, a stay alert, and muscle pain reliever in mine). They roll on like a charm. For refilling just Google it. I found a very simple diagram on how to do so. I like these bottles as I said, but I wish they had more colors. If you have more than 3, labeling becomes a necessity.</li>
            <li> Really cute but not easy to get the ball out to refill.  I had to find needle nose pliers to squeeze the neck to pop the ball out.  One of the bottles leaks but the others are fine.  I probably won&#x27;t choose this again just because of the ball issue.  It&#x27;s a shame because they are so pretty.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous! Very well made! I use them for homemade perfumes and essential oils and they are just perfect! I wish they came in a small size too!</li>

            <li> I love the product! Will order again great quality. N love ur business cards!!!</li>
