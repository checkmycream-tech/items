            <li>Skin feels great afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It had great reviews, but I did not get the results as promised by using it.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth is always creating very effective and functional products.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I wanted a peel to use in between his peel, and this peel is very nice.</li>
            <li>Have always been impressed by these Peel Pads; excellent product that work very well.</li>
            <li>I have always gotten compliments on my skin and this is a good product to maintain the good health of the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is almost as good as getting a glycolic peel at a dermatologists office.</li>
            <li>I have bought glycolic acid peels on amazon before and loved the results</li>
            <li>Good to wipe skin with before applying toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Definitely authentic and seems newer, and sealed, works great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year and love the effects!</li>
            <li>I love these !</li>
            <li>Love this~!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Maybe try both and see which ones work better!</li>
            <li>First off, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>but at this point I doubt they&#x27;re even effective anymore...</li>
            <li>The ingredients are at the highest levels to be effective.</li>
            <li>Never irritates, even though the solution is effective at smoothing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>but I think that is what makes it so effective.</li>
            <li>I can not say I was thrilled with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I have used before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a good deal, but they still aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything the manufacturer says and I think would be suitable for most people.</li>
            <li>I will give it more time and hope to see more results.</li>
            <li>price and excellent overall service.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything worthwhile for my skin, either, but I am loath to blame Peter Thomas Roth.  </li>
            <li>This allows the Peels to penetrate better as well.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with these pads and amazon sells them cheaper than any</li>
            <li>She looks much younger and is very happy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I love how these make my skin feel, keeps me from breaking out too.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d be better off just buying some clearasil wipes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>used to buy it from Sephora, but it is so much more affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE GOOD FOR REMOVING OIL BUILD UP, BUT ALSO GOOD FOR REMOVING OLD SKIN CELLS.  </li>
            <li>You Better Shop Around&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Like shiny healthy look after using.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I tried these  because they got better Reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>Dr denese ones work much better.</li>
            <li>The foil top was not even sealed, and it smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face smooth like glass!  </li>
            <li>but I got a lot more.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The Ulta girl talked me into buying these for those reasons and I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is nothing more than a glorified astringent.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, you will love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe with more time I will notice a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and I get many compliments about how beautiful my complexion is.</li>
            <li>I think I can say I have pretty fair skin now</li>
            <li>As with most high-end products, you&#x27;re strongly urged to consider the seller that you&#x27;re purchasing through.</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and the price was VERY right!</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that it has become part of her beauty regime now.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use-recommend</li>
            <li>its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, lots of pads</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, since this section is for rating the product, I&#x27;ve given it the 5 starts I believe it deserves, but I couldn&#x27;t in good conscious not do my best to try and get people to look elsewhere for this or any other health or grooming</li>
            <li>Afterwards my face feels super smooth and makeup goes on better</li>
            <li>After using this product for two weeks I saw a HUGE improvement in pore size.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and I feel is important to mention.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but effective...</li>
            <li>the as I noticed such a great change in her skin...</li>
            <li>At 26 I do not have a ton of wrinkles, but I do have very large pores which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of.</li>
            <li>If you do not remove the oils from your skin first, the acids have to try to fight through the skin oils and they won&#x27;t penetrate the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>My daughters who have acne use these and it has helped clean up their skin.</li>
            <li>Skin just feels soft, smooth and amazing.  </li>
            <li>At full pop in brick-and-mortar stores, this sells for about $45.  </li>
            <li>and I can do it more often without the intense burning.</li>
            <li>I use them 3-4 times a week, after I remove the day&#x27;s makeup, I rub in a circular motion over my forehead, cheeks and neck; let it sit on there about 15 minutes and then rinse with cool water and apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I bought it for my relatives and friends for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Got the product quick and have been using it.  </li>
            <li>and using these peels helps my moisturizes and serums absorb deeper and quickly.</li>
            <li>Item as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Thank-you very much!</li>
            <li>A better term would probably be &#x27;over-sealed&#x27;, because the glued that&#x27;d been used was strong enough to qualify it for child</li>
            <li>These really work for fine lines.</li>
            <li>Between the price I paid and the unsealed jar, I&#x27;m certain that what I received was not the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t remove the old skin cells, your creams and serums just sit on top of your face and will not do their job.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and since using people are always telling me how lovely my skin is.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and originally purchased these because I have acne prone skin, worsened by hormones and large pores.</li>
            <li>when used daily can help your moisturizer to be better absorbed so you get the full benefits of your products.</li>
            <li>she was right.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start this off on the right foot--they do not peel your face.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for this product.</li>
            <li>They make your face very smooth and also help to clear up any acne that you may have and may help prevent new acne from forming.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Similar to many reviewers here</li>
            <li>It really works, it smoothes out her complexion!  </li>
            <li>The outcome is smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>These pads clear and shrink my pores, fade age spots, erase wrinkles and make my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>QVC also sells TWO packs of the 60 count un-wrinkle pads (120 pads total) for $45; which means you&#x27;re getting a better deal than on here, and from a reliable seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the last skin care products I would give up; this plus a good moisturizer is really enough.</li>
            <li>Week three some more of the same, im also seeing no pore minimization, which I had really hoped for.</li>
            <li>These are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li>In addition, i have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>peel pads from Sai Holdings and they were sealed and new!!</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, fine lines disappear and when I wake up my make-up just glides on.</li>
            <li>I brag about it all the time, I bought it by reading the reviews on here and it makes such a difference even the very first time!</li>
            <li>After using them awhile, my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>The vendor&#x27;s price point is totally reasonable and delivery timely.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Leaves you silky smooth and I can see the blackheads are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li>I noticed a real difference in my skin just a couple weeks after using these pads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Even after i wash this off my face remains very sticky</li>
            <li>It has made a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>but this is so much easier</li>
            <li>Acne scars fade away so much quicker.  </li>
            <li>so I know the one I received is the real deal.</li>
            <li>As the package states, there is a gentle tingling when the product is used.  </li>
            <li>Really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much change yet, but I am still using them.</li>
            <li>all I can see is wow!!!</li>
            <li>TO OFTEN, THEY COULD DRY YOUR SKIN OUT VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any real difference in the appearance of my face, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li>Many recent reviews stated their product was open mine was sealed shut.  </li>
            <li>The pads made my skin really soft and smooth and are so simple to use.</li>
            <li>Received quickly; and use almost daily now!  </li>
            <li>I see a lot of poor reviews on this product on Amazon, and that led me to order from a different, more reputable seller today.</li>
            <li>However, there are too many reviews on this page stating opened, unsealed containers with discolored and dried pads/seals.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that visibly shrinks pores and makes fine lines disappear after only 3 weeks of use!!!!  </li>
            <li>and it was packed well, sealed, and brand new.  </li>
            <li>But this seller tried to pass as new by resealing jar.</li>
            <li>I feel like I totally skipped something important when I don&#x27;t use them in my daily</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Only one of the seals lifted as I opened it, so I used that jar first.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>make sure you wash it off after a few minutes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 with the beginnings of fine lines and the remnants of teenaged skin issues (enlarged pores, some blackheads on my nose) and hormonal acne exactly when I have the least patience to deal with it.</li>
            <li>but the fine lines I was just beginning to develop (one very long one across the middle of my forehead, and some under, around, and between my eyes) are virtually gone.</li>
            <li>That stated, this is a lovely get deep down into the pore way of cleaning your face in the evenings.  </li>
            <li>I read in many reviews that you only need half a pad per use</li>
            <li>Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The container of Peter Thomas Roth Un Wrinkle Peel Pads I received from them had not just been opened at one point, but clearly resealed afterward.</li>
            <li>My skin is acne-prone even though I am in my (early) 30s, and these keep everything in check.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, I&#x27;m really working on preventative anti aging measures.</li>
            <li>35 years old.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin, sebborhic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I am still going for a professional chemical peel.  </li>
            <li>I am 51yrs old.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s doing</li>
            <li>I never did return this since I got so busy and just didn&#x27;t take the time to do it.  </li>
            <li>You can order directly through the Peter Thomas Roth website, through Ulta&#x27;s website (or go directly to your nearest Ulta) and pay $45 for 60 pads...</li>
            <li>Using this product with the peeling gel product and using both as directed has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am hoping the previous reviews are right and these pads are miracle workers.</li>
            <li>When I received the pads, the jar was ALREADY opened and the pads inside were barely damp.</li>
            <li>The Peter Thomas Roth website actually had products listed as &amp;#34;Exclusively sold through QVC&amp;#34; which you couldn&#x27;t even purchase directly from their website.</li>
            <li>The first week I was amazed at how smoothe my skin felt after wach application, I also felt my dark spots were lightening as well as a cessation of breakouts.</li>
            <li>My warning is not limited to cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>The area around my nose and forehead has developed those gross tiny bumps that make you look like a reptile and the pores on my cheeks are still monstrous.</li>
            <li>They sting a little when I first started using them</li>
            <li>I wish this provider took a little more care in handling, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything shady going on.</li>
            <li>To prolong their life, I cut each pad in half, using 1 whole a day.</li>
            <li>.. due to them seeming not being as potent/effective as the products purchased fresh from Sephora or other stores..</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil cleanser then Skinnygirl Face Solutions Vitamin C Face Scrub to get the loose skin off, then I cleanse again, then tone with Avalon Organics vitamin C toner, then apply my Voila&#x27; Ve Triple Action Vitamin C serum.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face smooth like glass!  </li>
            <li> but I got a lot more.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The Ulta girl talked me into buying these for those reasons and I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is nothing more than a glorified astringent.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, you will love it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe with more time I will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and I get many compliments about how beautiful my complexion is.</li>
            <li> I think I can say I have pretty fair skin now</li>
            <li> As with most high-end products, you&#x27;re strongly urged to consider the seller that you&#x27;re purchasing through.</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and the price was VERY right!</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that it has become part of her beauty regime now.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use-recommend</li>
            <li> its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, lots of pads</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, since this section is for rating the product, I&#x27;ve given it the 5 starts I believe it deserves, but I couldn&#x27;t in good conscious not do my best to try and get people to look elsewhere for this or any other health or grooming</li>
            <li> Afterwards my face feels super smooth and makeup goes on better</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks I saw a HUGE improvement in pore size.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and I feel is important to mention.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but effective...</li>
            <li> the as I noticed such a great change in her skin...</li>
            <li> At 26 I do not have a ton of wrinkles, but I do have very large pores which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of.</li>
            <li> If you do not remove the oils from your skin first, the acids have to try to fight through the skin oils and they won&#x27;t penetrate the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> My daughters who have acne use these and it has helped clean up their skin.</li>
            <li> Skin just feels soft, smooth and amazing.  </li>
            <li> At full pop in brick-and-mortar stores, this sells for about $45.  </li>
            <li> and I can do it more often without the intense burning.</li>
            <li> I use them 3-4 times a week, after I remove the day&#x27;s makeup, I rub in a circular motion over my forehead, cheeks and neck; let it sit on there about 15 minutes and then rinse with cool water and apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I bought it for my relatives and friends for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Got the product quick and have been using it.  </li>
            <li> and using these peels helps my moisturizes and serums absorb deeper and quickly.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Thank-you very much!</li>
            <li> A better term would probably be &#x27;over-sealed&#x27;, because the glued that&#x27;d been used was strong enough to qualify it for child</li>
            <li> These really work for fine lines.</li>
            <li> Between the price I paid and the unsealed jar, I&#x27;m certain that what I received was not the genuine product.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t remove the old skin cells, your creams and serums just sit on top of your face and will not do their job.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and since using people are always telling me how lovely my skin is.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and originally purchased these because I have acne prone skin, worsened by hormones and large pores.</li>
            <li> when used daily can help your moisturizer to be better absorbed so you get the full benefits of your products.</li>
            <li> she was right.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this off on the right foot--they do not peel your face.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so very much for this product.</li>
            <li> They make your face very smooth and also help to clear up any acne that you may have and may help prevent new acne from forming.  </li>
            <li> My hands feel so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Similar to many reviewers here</li>
            <li> It really works, it smoothes out her complexion!  </li>
            <li> The outcome is smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> These pads clear and shrink my pores, fade age spots, erase wrinkles and make my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> QVC also sells TWO packs of the 60 count un-wrinkle pads (120 pads total) for $45; which means you&#x27;re getting a better deal than on here, and from a reliable seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the last skin care products I would give up; this plus a good moisturizer is really enough.</li>
            <li> Week three some more of the same, im also seeing no pore minimization, which I had really hoped for.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li> In addition, i have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> peel pads from Sai Holdings and they were sealed and new!!</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, fine lines disappear and when I wake up my make-up just glides on.</li>
            <li> I brag about it all the time, I bought it by reading the reviews on here and it makes such a difference even the very first time!</li>
            <li> After using them awhile, my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> The vendor&#x27;s price point is totally reasonable and delivery timely.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves you silky smooth and I can see the blackheads are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li> I noticed a real difference in my skin just a couple weeks after using these pads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Even after i wash this off my face remains very sticky</li>
            <li> It has made a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but this is so much easier</li>
            <li> Acne scars fade away so much quicker.  </li>
            <li> so I know the one I received is the real deal.</li>
            <li> As the package states, there is a gentle tingling when the product is used.  </li>
            <li> Really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much change yet, but I am still using them.</li>
            <li> all I can see is wow!!!</li>
            <li> TO OFTEN, THEY COULD DRY YOUR SKIN OUT VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any real difference in the appearance of my face, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> Many recent reviews stated their product was open mine was sealed shut.  </li>
            <li> The pads made my skin really soft and smooth and are so simple to use.</li>
            <li> Received quickly; and use almost daily now!  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of poor reviews on this product on Amazon, and that led me to order from a different, more reputable seller today.</li>
            <li> However, there are too many reviews on this page stating opened, unsealed containers with discolored and dried pads/seals.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that visibly shrinks pores and makes fine lines disappear after only 3 weeks of use!!!!  </li>
            <li> and it was packed well, sealed, and brand new.  </li>
            <li> But this seller tried to pass as new by resealing jar.</li>
            <li> I feel like I totally skipped something important when I don&#x27;t use them in my daily</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only one of the seals lifted as I opened it, so I used that jar first.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> make sure you wash it off after a few minutes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 with the beginnings of fine lines and the remnants of teenaged skin issues (enlarged pores, some blackheads on my nose) and hormonal acne exactly when I have the least patience to deal with it.</li>
            <li> but the fine lines I was just beginning to develop (one very long one across the middle of my forehead, and some under, around, and between my eyes) are virtually gone.</li>
            <li> That stated, this is a lovely get deep down into the pore way of cleaning your face in the evenings.  </li>
            <li> I read in many reviews that you only need half a pad per use</li>
            <li> Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The container of Peter Thomas Roth Un Wrinkle Peel Pads I received from them had not just been opened at one point, but clearly resealed afterward.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone even though I am in my (early) 30s, and these keep everything in check.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, I&#x27;m really working on preventative anti aging measures.</li>
            <li> 35 years old.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin, sebborhic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I am still going for a professional chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> I am 51yrs old.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s doing</li>
            <li> I never did return this since I got so busy and just didn&#x27;t take the time to do it.  </li>
            <li> You can order directly through the Peter Thomas Roth website, through Ulta&#x27;s website (or go directly to your nearest Ulta) and pay $45 for 60 pads...</li>
            <li> Using this product with the peeling gel product and using both as directed has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am hoping the previous reviews are right and these pads are miracle workers.</li>
            <li> When I received the pads, the jar was ALREADY opened and the pads inside were barely damp.</li>
            <li> The Peter Thomas Roth website actually had products listed as &amp;#34;Exclusively sold through QVC&amp;#34; which you couldn&#x27;t even purchase directly from their website.</li>
            <li> The first week I was amazed at how smoothe my skin felt after wach application, I also felt my dark spots were lightening as well as a cessation of breakouts.</li>
            <li> My warning is not limited to cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> The area around my nose and forehead has developed those gross tiny bumps that make you look like a reptile and the pores on my cheeks are still monstrous.</li>
            <li> They sting a little when I first started using them</li>
            <li> I wish this provider took a little more care in handling, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything shady going on.</li>
            <li> To prolong their life, I cut each pad in half, using 1 whole a day.</li>
            <li> .. due to them seeming not being as potent/effective as the products purchased fresh from Sephora or other stores..</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil cleanser then Skinnygirl Face Solutions Vitamin C Face Scrub to get the loose skin off, then I cleanse again, then tone with Avalon Organics vitamin C toner, then apply my Voila&#x27; Ve Triple Action Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> That is not something I would have ordinarily said when all my red blotches were still taking up real estate on my face.</li>
            <li> I would never pay full price for this item on other sites, but the deal here on Amazon was hard to pass by.</li>
            <li> and they last twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The top protector has been split and half of it is not sealed, the other side is &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the container and that exact spot looks dirty.</li>
            <li> It has many vitamin oils, a mild 20% mixture of acids, green tea (which is very soothing with the vitamin oils), doesn&#x27;t have an awful odor.</li>
            <li> I could feel a little sting (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I use St. Ives Apricot Scrub every day since I&#x27;m obsessed with keeping my face smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother (she&#x27;s been wanting to try it for a long time).</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and it exfoliates without harsh granules.</li>
            <li> The seal on the tub was wide open.  </li>
            <li> I also use Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; peel every other day.</li>
            <li> However, it is not completely sealed!</li>
            <li> None of my other so called peel pads ever left that feeling on my face</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and can and dont dry out from use.</li>
            <li> Not new, not as described</li>
            <li> wash With african black soap, using an exfoliating facial pad every other day, use this peel, follow up with yes to blueberries serum and night time cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already contacted Amazon directly regarding this matter, and my personal experience is that they take these complaints seriously.</li>
            <li> Can be used daily or less often; for just the face, a half of a pad is enough.</li>
            <li> Although I will say, they seem to not stick around as long, but they still left there typical dark spot, no change there.</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily, my skin looks dewy, youthful and firm.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the pads stay wet to the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL NOT TO US THEM</li>
            <li> Still, there are days my face just feels sorta rough.</li>
            <li> Now, if you go to the dermatologist or aesthetics center, this is nothing like you receive from them.  </li>
            <li> Half a pad is more than enough for your face, neck and hands... and cutting them in half will mean that they will last you twice as long!</li>
            <li> The peeling effect is very very subtle, but after each use my skin does feel soft and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s actually doing something.  </li>
            <li> Every other day I use sea kelp toner and do a clay mask with apple cider vinegar weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other day when my mom and I were at the store I called to her</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other reviews that were one star.</li>
            <li> I use them just about every other day after taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 5 piece set with the 60 count Un-wrinkle pads and 4 other PTR proucts for</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products that came in my set..</li>
            <li> This product, while a little expensive, is worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the adhesive label was placed so as to cover some of the instructions.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that some dark spots from breakouts have lightened,</li>
            <li> The seal on the jar I received was damaged, but it looked like it was stored upside down</li>
            <li> yes you can cut them in half and still cover face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle</li>
            <li> So if you use it twice a week and half at a time, you&#x27;re looking at about an 8 month supply here.</li>
            <li> so I have cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I cut my pads in half</li>
            <li> It came tightly package and unopened.</li>
            <li> Your face will have a slight tingle at first and you must use cold water to neutralize the product after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off when I unscrewed the lid &amp; the protective covering was brownish.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there&#x27;s a little bit of tingling, but it just makes me think the chemicals are working.</li>
            <li> it tingles a little, but doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I will never order these again what a waste of money</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always wondered if beauty products were really old here, or fake etc</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t firm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are just super old, or if it&#x27;s just a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to give it as a Christmas gift, but now I am not sure about that.</li>
            <li> that remains on the face like an oil slick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen printer toner and maintenance parts selling way below cost, and I know the profit margin on those items is not great, so if you&#x27;re getting something for half price, you&#x27;re likely getting a fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Also, these pads are extremely generous and I would recommend cutting them in half when you use them.</li>
            <li> I know this probably sounds like common sense to some, but it is not known by all</li>
            <li> I like this because it has helped to soften the scar spots where I had late in life blemishes.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t just disgraceful, dishonest behavior on SAI HOLDINGS WW INC&#x27;s part, it&#x27;s a serious health code</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from using a serious foundation to a tinted primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to get a fake, opened, or dried up one due to all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money regardless of the price!!!</li>
            <li> I had read a couple of reviews saying that their bottles had been opened and tampered with; but, unfortunately, I did not listen to them.  </li>
            <li> Week two those annoying deep pimples started to rear there ugly heads.</li>
            <li> And yes it does make your skin peel so be prepared for the peel of very thin layers.</li>
            <li> I thank all the reviewers and with their help I heed their warning and stayed away from the bad sellers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it based on the reviews and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it took menopause to make my skin crazy!</li>
            <li> Bad of me!  </li>
            <li> I am a skeptical buyer when it comes to skin products but this one truly works!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ever since I discovered these pads, I am never without them. My skin is acne-prone even though I am in my (early) 30s, and these keep everything in check. After using them awhile, my skin is much smoother. They have become an essential part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> When I received the pads, the jar was ALREADY opened and the pads inside were barely damp. What a waste of money!!! I have yet to try the actual pads but at this point I doubt they&#x27;re even effective anymore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of years now. The vendor&#x27;s price point is totally reasonable and delivery timely. Highly recommend this product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for about 4 wks &amp; have noticed some results. My skin is smoother. After using the pad on my face I&#x27;ve been using on the back of my hands like the directions said to do. My hands feel so soft &amp; smooth. I will give it more time and hope to see more results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin? Not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> MY FACE FELT TIGHTER AND SMOOTHER AS SOON AS I USED THESE PADS. GREAT PRODUCT I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and love the effects!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Wish the were a bit stronger though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sebborhic  dermatitis since I was 15, 20 years. In addition, i have super sensitive skin. Now that I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, I&#x27;m really working on preventative anti aging measures. This is fantastic product. I purchased it based on the reviews and have not been disappointed. I use it twice daily, my skin looks dewy, youthful and firm. The acids in this peel keep my dermatitis from flaring up, great side effect in addition to awesome skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash With african black soap, using an exfoliating facial pad every other day, use this peel, follow up with yes to blueberries serum and night time cream. Every other day I use sea kelp toner and do a clay mask with apple cider vinegar weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;African American female, caramel complexion. 35 years old. Sensitive skin, sebborhic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Have always been impressed by these Peel Pads; excellent product that work very well. Two-three times a week for me is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;Fair price and excellent overall service. Would buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Read everyone else&#x27;s reviews before using.l yes you can cut them in half and still cover face, neck and hands. Leaves you silky smooth and I can see the blackheads are getting smaller. Easy to use-recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for about 6 mnths now. I started out using one daily in the evening followed my my moisturizer.  Your face will have a slight tingle at first and you must use cold water to neutralize the product after a few minutes. I love these ! I now use them every day. They make your face very smooth and also help to clear up any acne that you may have and may help prevent new acne from forming.  These pads when used daily can help your moisturizer to be better absorbed so you get the full benefits of your products. I feel like I totally skipped something important when I don&#x27;t use them in my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I will ALWAYS use these and I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li> I noticed a real difference in my skin just a couple weeks after using these pads. My skin is so soft and I get many compliments about how beautiful my complexion is. I highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Many recent reviews stated their product was open mine was sealed shut.  I think they the pads do what they are meant to do.  My pores are tighter and my skin is smoother.  I leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse w/cold water.  I moisturize with 100% avocado oil that I buy from Costco.  That being said,  I am still going for a professional chemical peel.  This is not a miracle product I don&#x27;t think there is one out there!</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth is always creating very effective and functional products.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pad version of applying AHA&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the skin radiant!</li>
            <li> Got the product quick and have been using it.  Slight tingle when on, wash it off and feels like baby skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from an Amazon seller last year.  Similar to many reviewers here, mine came unsealed.  At full pop in brick-and-mortar stores, this sells for about $45.  Beware when you purchase something at half price, particularly from sites like Amazon and Ebay: there are a lot of vendors selling counterfeit goods.  Between the price I paid and the unsealed jar, I&#x27;m certain that what I received was not the genuine product.  It didn&#x27;t do anything worthwhile for my skin, either, but I am loath to blame Peter Thomas Roth.  My warning is not limited to cosmetics.  I&#x27;ve seen printer toner and maintenance parts selling way below cost, and I know the profit margin on those items is not great, so if you&#x27;re getting something for half price, you&#x27;re likely getting a fake.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these 60ct. peel pads from Sai Holdings and they were sealed and new!! They are sealed with the styrofoam seal. That is how the manufacturer seals them. Only one of the seals lifted as I opened it, so I used that jar first. This is no fault of the seller. Amazon packaged them well and I received them in 2 days. With that being said, these peels work great. I could feel a little sting (I have sensitive skin). I don&#x27;t want a peel that is going to burn my skin! This is just what I was looking for. I also use Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27; peel every other day. I wanted a peel to use in between his peel, and this peel is very nice. My pores are smaller, fine lines disappear and when I wake up my make-up just glides on. I am 51yrs old. and using these peels helps my moisturizes and serums absorb deeper and quickly. If you don&#x27;t remove the old skin cells, your creams and serums just sit on top of your face and will not do their job. I use them on my face, neck, decollete&#x27;, and the backs of my hands. I also use a Clarisonic Pro to help remove oils before I use the peel. This allows the Peels to penetrate better as well. If you do not remove the oils from your skin first, the acids have to try to fight through the skin oils and they won&#x27;t penetrate the top layer of skin. I know this probably sounds like common sense to some, but it is not known by all and I feel is important to mention. Love this peel!!!</li>
            <li> This product is just great. The pads made my skin really soft and smooth and are so simple to use. Thank-you very much!</li>
            <li> Even after i wash this off my face remains very sticky..HATE this product. I will never order these again what a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with these pads and amazon sells them cheaper than any where else.  My daughters who have acne use these and it has helped clean up their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother (she&#x27;s been wanting to try it for a long time). WOW! It really works, it smoothes out her complexion!  She loved it so much that it has become part of her beauty regime now. She looks much younger and is very happy with the results of this product. The other day when my mom and I were at the store I called to her and as I was waling toward her a woman approached and said she thought we were sisters! She had to know what my mom used! This product, while a little expensive, is worth it.</li>
            <li> Another ptr product I would never stop using. It makes your skin soft and it exfoliates without harsh granules. its so easy to use. The ingredients are at the highest levels to be effective.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my face, neck, and hands. It&#x27;s everything the manufacturer says and I think would be suitable for most people. Can be used daily or less often; for just the face, a half of a pad is enough. So if you use it twice a week and half at a time, you&#x27;re looking at about an 8 month supply here. Never irritates, even though the solution is effective at smoothing and exfoliating. This is one of the last skin care products I would give up; this plus a good moisturizer is really enough. I don&#x27;t know how it could be improved. Oh, and the pads stay wet to the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> Love this~! Received quickly; and use almost daily now!  makes my skin look great.  Thank you so very much for this product.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten compliments on my skin and this is a good product to maintain the good health of the skin.  The peeling effect is very very subtle, but after each use my skin does feel soft and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s actually doing something.  The tingling is another sign it might be working.  I would never pay full price for this item on other sites, but the deal here on Amazon was hard to pass by.</li>
            <li> I brag about it all the time, I bought it by reading the reviews on here and it makes such a difference even the very first time! Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I love how these make my skin feel, keeps me from breaking out too. This was my 3rd Amazon beauty purchase and I&#x27;ve always wondered if beauty products were really old here, or fake etc.. due to them seeming not being as potent/effective as the products purchased fresh from Sephora or other stores.. but this one is PERFECT! Definitely authentic and seems newer, and sealed, works great. Saved $. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off when I unscrewed the lid &amp; the protective covering was brownish. I&#x27;m not sure if these are just super old, or if it&#x27;s just a terrible product.  I think I&#x27;d be better off just buying some clearasil wipes. These are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and arrived on time. However, it is not completely sealed! The top protector has been split and half of it is not sealed, the other side is &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the container and that exact spot looks dirty. I ordered this item to give it as a Christmas gift, but now I am not sure about that.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft. Sometimes there&#x27;s a little bit of tingling, but it just makes me think the chemicals are working. The outcome is smooth, soft skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Exfoliates, smoothes out blotchy patches.  This is almost as good as getting a glycolic peel at a dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 2 weeks. I have not seen any real difference in the appearance of my face, but I have high hopes. I read in many reviews that you only need half a pad per use so I have cut them in half. I am hoping the previous reviews are right and these pads are miracle workers. I will continue to use and wait for results.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has made a real difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 32 with the beginnings of fine lines and the remnants of teenaged skin issues (enlarged pores, some blackheads on my nose) and hormonal acne exactly when I have the least patience to deal with it. These pads clear and shrink my pores, fade age spots, erase wrinkles and make my skin so smooth. I&#x27;ve gone from using a serious foundation to a tinted primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy it from Sephora, but it is so much more affordable on Amazon. The seal on the jar I received was damaged, but it looked like it was stored upside down and the product had eaten away at it. The product smelled the same and behaved the same as I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good deal, but they still aren&#x27;t cheap. I wish this provider took a little more care in handling, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything shady going on.</li>
            <li> Bought these on the recommendation of a friend.  Have been using them a month and find nothing happening or benefitting my skin.  Would not spend my money on these again.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has helped to soften the scar spots where I had late in life blemishes. Funny I went through puberty without ever having a pimple and it took menopause to make my skin crazy! This is easy to use, lots of pads and so it lasts 60 days using one pad at night. I use this, wait about two hours then use my scrub, then vitamin C toner, then put on my vitamin C serum. I think I can say I have pretty fair skin now and I&#x27;m 59. That is not something I would have ordinarily said when all my red blotches were still taking up real estate on my face. It does have a sort of oily feel to it that remains on the face like an oil slick but I think that is what makes it so effective. None of my other so called peel pads ever left that feeling on my face but then they didn&#x27;t work like this does either. And yes it does make your skin peel so be prepared for the peel of very thin layers. I use Cetaphil cleanser then Skinnygirl Face Solutions Vitamin C Face Scrub to get the loose skin off, then I cleanse again, then tone with Avalon Organics vitamin C toner, then apply my Voila&#x27; Ve Triple Action Vitamin C serum. It has three forms of vitamin C in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! At 26 I do not have a ton of wrinkles, but I do have very large pores which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of. After using this product for two weeks I saw a HUGE improvement in pore size. Its the only skin product I swear by!</li>
            <li> Not new, not as described</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other reviews that were one star. I received my product with the seal opened and the product did not smell correct. Will be returning for a refund</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GOOD FOR REMOVING OIL BUILD UP, BUT ALSO GOOD FOR REMOVING OLD SKIN CELLS.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO US THEM TO OFTEN, THEY COULD DRY YOUR SKIN OUT VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but effective...and the price was VERY right! For those born after 1970 ...there was a song &amp;#34;Momma Said You Better Shop Around&amp;#34;...she was right.</li>
            <li> Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime. Like shiny healthy look after using. Don&#x27;t notice any change with skin condition, pores or wrinkles, although tried a 2nd order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but not from this seller. Received the container already opened, the pads were yellow, and the smell was off. Gross.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Can use daily, for 2 minutes or 10 minutes.  Easy to use.  Skin feels great afterwards.  Pores look noticable cleaner and smalled with use.</li>
            <li> all I can see is wow!!! I am a skeptical buyer when it comes to skin products but this one truly works!!!! I am 48 years old and since using people are always telling me how lovely my skin is. they actually say I have a glow. extremely pleased with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I had read a couple of reviews saying that their bottles had been opened and tampered with; but, unfortunately, I did not listen to them.  Wish I had.  BOTH bottles I ordered had been opened and the contents were not the PTR product.  SKINWEST/SAI Holdings is a CROOKED company.  Don&#x27;t waste your money regardless of the price!!!</li>
            <li> I can not say I was thrilled with the performance of this product.  It had great reviews, but I did not get the results as promised by using it.  I give it a 3 star rating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and so far it&#x27;s doing ok. I&#x27;ll have to check back in after longer term use! it tingles a little, but doesn&#x27;t burn. make sure you wash it off after a few minutes!</li>
            <li> I use St. Ives Apricot Scrub every day since I&#x27;m obsessed with keeping my face smooth and exfoliated. Still, there are days my face just feels sorta rough.The directions say to leave it for just a minute or so, but I leave it on for 10-30 minutes with no problems. Afterwards my face feels super smooth and makeup goes on better</li>
            <li> I have used them before and will continue to do so.  Only problem was that the manufacturers had not placed the container&#x27;s lid on tightly enough so the liquid contents had leaked all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> I use resurfacing pads every night, before these I had tried dr. Denese firming pads, they don&#x27;t firm but they exfoliate on a cellular level,which these don&#x27;t do. I tried these  because they got better Reviews on amazon. Dr denese ones work much better. Maybe try both and see which ones work better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever given anything one star before.  I never did return this since I got so busy and just didn&#x27;t take the time to do it.  Bad of me!  I tossed it instead since I was frightened of it.  I use Peter Thomas Roth products, and this was not their product.  Or if it was, it had been returned and repackaged.  The foil top was not even sealed, and it smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did; ignore this deal...</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase so I can say that I am a fan. It came tightly package and unopened. They sting a little when I first started using them but now I don&#x27;t even feel it. Don&#x27;t know if my skin is used to them or if there potency diminishes after being opened. I use them just about every other day after taking off my makeup. I leave on for 5-10 minutes then rinse off and add my moisturizer. It always refreshes my skin and seems to keep it glowing. I have bought glycolic acid peels on amazon before and loved the results but this is so much easier and I can do it more often without the intense burning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Makes my face smooth like glass!  Pores are smaller.  Acne scars fade away so much quicker.  Skin just feels soft, smooth and amazing.  I cut my pads in half and they last twice as long.  I am beyond thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  I was afraid I was going to get a fake, opened, or dried up one due to all the negative reviews.  I thank all the reviewers and with their help I heed their warning and stayed away from the bad sellers.  I purchased mines from Yolo Beauty and it was packed well, sealed, and brand new.  I buy this from Sephora all the time so I know the one I received is the real deal. I will definitely be repurchasing from here again when I run out.</li>
            <li> As with most high-end products, you&#x27;re strongly urged to consider the seller that you&#x27;re purchasing through. I see a lot of poor reviews on this product on Amazon, and that led me to order from a different, more reputable seller today. I&#x27;ve purchased these pads from Ulta before, and they were $45 for 60 pads. Of course, I want some cheaper than that. However, there are too many reviews on this page stating opened, unsealed containers with discolored and dried pads/seals. I&#x27;m not going to risk it. You can order directly through the Peter Thomas Roth website, through Ulta&#x27;s website (or go directly to your nearest Ulta) and pay $45 for 60 pads... OR... The Peter Thomas Roth website actually had products listed as &amp;#34;Exclusively sold through QVC&amp;#34; which you couldn&#x27;t even purchase directly from their website. Since the PTR website endorsed QVC as a reliable seller, I went on over to QVC to check out their PTR products. I ordered a 5 piece set with the 60 count Un-wrinkle pads and 4 other PTR proucts for $39+tax, s/h. At the end, it cost me $50 but I got a lot more. QVC also sells TWO packs of the 60 count un-wrinkle pads (120 pads total) for $45; which means you&#x27;re getting a better deal than on here, and from a reliable seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Also, these pads are extremely generous and I would recommend cutting them in half when you use them. Half a pad is more than enough for your face, neck and hands... and cutting them in half will mean that they will last you twice as long! :) **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and originally purchased these because I have acne prone skin, worsened by hormones and large pores. The Ulta girl talked me into buying these for those reasons and I fell in love with them. Not only is my skin clearer and my pores appear smaller... but the fine lines I was just beginning to develop (one very long one across the middle of my forehead, and some under, around, and between my eyes) are virtually gone. These really work for fine lines. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products that came in my set.. but I definitely give 5 stars just for the product as I would never risk buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but I am now a believer.  As the package states, there is a gentle tingling when the product is used.  My skin has a wonderful appearance.  This product delivers on its statements.  My only complaint is that the adhesive label was placed so as to cover some of the instructions.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Using this product with the peeling gel product and using both as directed has really helped my dry skin. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These have worked well for me</li>
            <li> First off, this is a wonderful product. I can&#x27;t speak for whether or not it does anything for wrinkles, but it&#x27;s without a doubt enabled me to throw away what I was using for my occasional bouts of premenstrual acne, and overall given me a clearer complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller ***SAI HOLDINGS WW INC*** is however another story entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container of Peter Thomas Roth Un Wrinkle Peel Pads I received from them had not just been opened at one point, but clearly resealed afterward. A better term would probably be &#x27;over-sealed&#x27;, because the glued that&#x27;d been used was strong enough to qualify it for child proofing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years, and know for a fact that opening the inner seal doesn&#x27;t ever require either a Bowie knife or a gym membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People use this product on their faces; around their mucus membranes.  This isn&#x27;t just disgraceful, dishonest behavior on SAI HOLDINGS WW INC&#x27;s part, it&#x27;s a serious health code violation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already contacted Amazon directly regarding this matter, and my personal experience is that they take these complaints seriously. I would advise anyone else who&#x27;s had a similar experience with this company to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, since this section is for rating the product, I&#x27;ve given it the 5 starts I believe it deserves, but I couldn&#x27;t in good conscious not do my best to try and get people to look elsewhere for this or any other health or grooming product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads&lt;br /&gt;F- SAI HOLDINGS WW INC</li>
            <li> Love it ! Really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy from SAI Holdings!!  The seal on the tub was wide open.  Who knows what is actually inside.  Gross.</li>
            <li> FInally, something that you can feel working and see a difference in pore size!!! Woohoo!!  My sister startedme on the as I noticed such a great change in her skin...Won&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> Nice product, I have used before. But this seller tried to pass as new by resealing jar. Foil lining was rotting underneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously twice a day for a month. I have oily skin and can and dont dry out from use.To prolong their life, I cut each pad in half, using 1 whole a day. The first week I was amazed at how smoothe my skin felt after wach application, I also felt my dark spots were lightening as well as a cessation of breakouts. Week two those annoying deep pimples started to rear there ugly heads. Although I will say, they seem to not stick around as long, but they still left there typical dark spot, no change there. Week three some more of the same, im also seeing no pore minimization, which I had really hoped for. Im just finishing up week for and I can say that some dark spots from breakouts have lightened, mind you im also using the clarisonic as well as PTRs retinol fusion pm simaltaneously. The area around my nose and forehead has developed those gross tiny bumps that make you look like a reptile and the pores on my cheeks are still monstrous. In my opinion this is nothing more than a glorified astringent.  Good to wipe skin with before applying toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this off on the right foot--they do not peel your face.  It has many vitamin oils, a mild 20% mixture of acids, green tea (which is very soothing with the vitamin oils), doesn&#x27;t have an awful odor. Now, if you go to the dermatologist or aesthetics center, this is nothing like you receive from them.  That stated, this is a lovely get deep down into the pore way of cleaning your face in the evenings.  I use them 3-4 times a week, after I remove the day&#x27;s makeup, I rub in a circular motion over my forehead, cheeks and neck; let it sit on there about 15 minutes and then rinse with cool water and apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I bought it for my relatives and friends for Christmas.  It is the only product that visibly shrinks pores and makes fine lines disappear after only 3 weeks of use!!!!  I cannot say enough good things about it!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Like getting a facial every morning.  In fact, I bet this is what they use at the spas and charge $75 each!  Ladies, you will love it.  Use every morning.  You&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much change yet, but I am still using them. Maybe with more time I will notice a difference.</li>
    </ol>
