            <li>The first day I used it my hair felt amazing!</li>
            <li>I use this product and love it.</li>
            <li>A very good product for dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Boycott their products, and instead use cruelty free products,.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>As long as it works as advertised and continues to be an affordable solution, I will continue to use this product happily.</li>
            <li>Works ok on the dandruff but leaves my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>it not only worked for my dandruff and my itchy scalp but it also made my hair very soft and shiny and it also smells very good.</li>
            <li>Great scent, leaves my hair super soft and has taken care of the flake issues I see in the dry months.</li>
            <li>Ask the right people and use the right questions and clinically proven can make lemons taste like sugar cubes.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered up really well and had a nice cooling sensation, the smell is also subtle but nice.</li>
            <li>me and my wife both uses the same and helps fully to cure my hairfall.i will always use head &amp; shoulder for sure.</li>
            <li>this seemed like such a great shampoo that would help my dry scalp!</li>
            <li>so I gave it a try because I have heard positive reviews about Head &amp; Shoulders from family.</li>
            <li>but I feel like this is a really unnatural reaction.</li>
            <li>This helped my head so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I use this regularly works every bit as good as the more expensive brands and here on amazon</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work particularly well.</li>
            <li>I ordered a 2-pack and only received one, but Amazon Customer Service is very helpful and assisted me right away.</li>
            <li>My kids get very dry scalps as the weather changes and this has helped significantly.</li>
            <li>The old head and shoulders used to do nothing for me</li>
            <li>However, after a few washes, the hair at the top of my head has become so greasy and gross!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and it has served to keep me dandruff free when I used to have it in the past.  </li>

            <li> Hope that other people don&#x27;t have the same thing</li>
            <li> I was out of shampoo and since it is winter my scalp is somewhat dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> but when they changed their formula a few years back, it changed the effectiveness</li>
            <li> clinically proven just means that there was no real research on the product just asking people questions.</li>
            <li> I was convinced all the other reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird because the second day it seemed like the rest of my hair was so soft but after closer inspection it actually has this greasy product in it that feels so uncomfortable and makes my hair look so gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product before!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad -</li>
            <li> No more flakes!</li>
            <li> but seriously lovin&#x27; this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical using this shampoo but my head was itchy and I started getting dandruff</li>
            <li> waste your time with prescriptions and failed home remedies, buy this shampoo now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed.</li>
            <li> Proctor and Gambel test all of their product including Head and Shoulders, Crest, and Cascade on animals including Monkeys, Rabbits, Cats, Dogs, Guinea Pigs, and rodents in cruel, unessesary tests that do nothing for the well being of humans.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot get this horrible greasy, sticky product out of the crown of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks horrible and unkempt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> IT IS TERRIBLE.</li>

            <li> Proctor and Gambel test all of their product including Head and Shoulders, Crest, and Cascade on animals including Monkeys, Rabbits, Cats, Dogs, Guinea Pigs, and rodents in cruel, unessesary tests that do nothing for the well being of humans.  Boycott their products, and instead use cruelty free products,. that are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Love H&amp;S! I love the smell of this version.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Head &amp; Shoulders :)&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff.. You have the cure :)</li>
            <li> My kids get very dry scalps as the weather changes and this has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> I love head and Shoulders but this never got rid of any dandruff I had. This one did not nothing or just agitated the situation. I ended up having to switch over to selsun blue. Ive never had any problems before with head and shoulders so maybe it was me</li>
            <li> I have literally never written a review for a product before but I just have to write one for this. I was out of shampoo and since it is winter my scalp is somewhat dry and itchy. So, I bought this product. I used it three days ago and I cannot get this horrible greasy, sticky product out of the crown of my hair. My hair looks horrible and unkempt. I do not know what to do. I even tried washing it multiple times with a different product to get it out. It&#x27;s disgusting. I will probably end up having to take a trip to the hair saloon just to get it washed out. I&#x27;m very annoyed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t great. Doesn&#x27;t work particularly well. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo ...the only one can control my itchy</li>
            <li> awesome product sweet deal</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and I use this regularly works every bit as good as the more expensive brands and here on amazon it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad - this seemed like such a great shampoo that would help my dry scalp! The first day I used it my hair felt amazing! The shampoo lathered up really well and had a nice cooling sensation, the smell is also subtle but nice. I was convinced all the other reviews were correct. However, after a few washes, the hair at the top of my head has become so greasy and gross! I&#x27;ve tried multiple washes of different shampoo but cannot get this build up or whatever it is out of my hair. It&#x27;s so weird because the second day it seemed like the rest of my hair was so soft but after closer inspection it actually has this greasy product in it that feels so uncomfortable and makes my hair look so gross. yuck! It might be the almond oil but I feel like this is a really unnatural reaction. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product before! Hope that other people don&#x27;t have the same thing happen to them.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be stoked about head n shoulders - No offense guys, heh,  but seriously lovin&#x27; this stuff. Great scent, leaves my hair super soft and has taken care of the flake issues I see in the dry months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son . He loves the way it leaves his hair</li>
            <li> smells great and works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Works ok on the dandruff but leaves my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> This is only product to protect flake falling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a head and shoulders thing or if its because they added almond oil, but my hair gets oily faster after using this shampoo. I can go longer without washing my hair when using different shampoos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and it has served to keep me dandruff free when I used to have it in the past.  As long as it works as advertised and continues to be an affordable solution, I will continue to use this product happily.</li>
            <li> Awesome product smells great would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out their for dandruff including prescription shampoo. The old head and shoulders used to do nothing for me but when they changed their formula a few years back, it changed the effectiveness totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have been using this head and shoulders type for the last 5 year and I have totally eliminated my dandruff and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time with prescriptions and failed home remedies, buy this shampoo now!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. It is everything as advertised. A very good product for dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This helped my head so much. I used to have a lot of dandruff here I can run my hand through my hair and flakes would be falling, But after using this for awhile, it stopped! No more flakes! And the smell of this is great!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2-pack and only received one, but Amazon Customer Service is very helpful and assisted me right away. I use this product and love it. I recommend, will buy again, and I hope this helps</li>
            <li> clinically proven just means that there was no real research on the product just asking people questions. Ask the right people and use the right questions and clinically proven can make lemons taste like sugar cubes.</li>
            <li> its a great product.completely work and truly i never used conditioner after wash. me and my wife both uses the same and helps fully to cure my hairfall.i will always use head &amp; shoulder for sure.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical using this shampoo but my head was itchy and I started getting dandruff so I gave it a try because I have heard positive reviews about Head &amp; Shoulders from family. it not only worked for my dandruff and my itchy scalp but it also made my hair very soft and shiny and it also smells very good. I highly recommend it!</li>
