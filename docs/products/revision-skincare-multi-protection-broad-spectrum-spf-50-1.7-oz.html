            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m loving buying it for a fraction of the cost on amazon.</li>
            <li>Have liked the Revision Intellishade so decided to try this SPF 50 with no color.</li>
            <li>This is the best find for me so far!</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen/moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Good under makeup or instead of makeup, as it makes your skin look smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moistuirizer and has a higher spf in it.  </li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>This specific product, the moisturizer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great product as always fast delivery</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands that caused acne and shine, or I felt like I had a plastic wrap on my face.  </li>
            <li>Also, many brands are</li>
            <li>I stopped use and my face appears to be much better now.   </li>
            <li>&quot; it is more on the glow or shine side, but your skin will look healthier and feel softer with this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it as such a great price!</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>I love this multi purpose day cream.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many moisture/sunscreen  products</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, changed after my neck lift on advice from surgeon &amp; staff.</li>
            <li>If you want more color use a tinted powder over your face after it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and find this product fine.  </li>
            <li>It is not matte, doesn&#x27;t have huge coverage of blemishes but doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Gives fabulous protection from the sun without altering the way your makeup goes on after.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the 45 tinted one (only because I don&#x27;t like color rubbing off onto a tissue when I touch my face), but this non-tinted one is great.</li>
            <li>With this, my face feels smooth and it soaks in well.</li>
            <li>In areas of shine, like t-zone, I use it lightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-stinging and offers good coverage.</li>
            <li>This is the best spf 50 moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, it leaves no white cast on the skin like some high spf products do.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and has no unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist originally suggested it.  </li>
            <li>It feels and smells great and has a lighter texture than many facial lotions with high SPF.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revisions for several years and what I love most about it is the smooth consistentcy as I apply it, the moisturizing results, and  the SPF 50 protection I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>I looked a long time for a good moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t sticky, oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>However, I liked it so much that I used it on many summer days, despite the high heat and humidity where I live.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products and will continue to try new things as they come out</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and when applied provides just enough \\&quot;slip\\&quot; for foundation application, but never goes on greasy.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, creamy, non-greasy, goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and fit for dry days~</li>
            <li>I first got this stuff from my dermatologist and was paying out the wazoo for it,</li>
            <li>An aesthetician recommended the Revision 45 in Matte, so I tried that one first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week and am very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>A sample tube for $38.00 really!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best oil free daily facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday  and its great keeps my skin soft and it protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li>This moistizer and SPF is just too much for hot days.</li>
            <li>Works well on my face as an all-around moisterizer and sun screen.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>I really like the SPF protection this product provides.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or white shade on my face.</li>
            <li>I bought Revision&#x27;s Nectifirm from a local cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and fell in love with it, so I decided to try a few more of their products.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very lightweight, yet moisturizes well</li>
            <li>because I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>it has so much SPF protection not all creams have this</li>
            <li>Perhaps when the weather is much cooler and the chance of sweating the product off will be lower,  I will retry it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>It came in a tube, which is a little more wastefull.</li>
            <li>Not greasing and absorbs well into skin so that foundation goes on as normal.  </li>
            <li>So far much better than anything else I have tried which includes Oil of Olay, ROC, Neutrogena, Avon and Mary Kay to name a few.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that likes to react to almost everything.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy, (almost chalk-like), white streaks on your face or have that stench that most high SPFs do.  </li>
            <li>I was in need of a high SPF lotion or cream because I live in Colorado where the sun is intense and the air is dry, and this stuff does the trick.  </li>
            <li>So far, no breakouts and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy my second tube.</li>
            <li>What surprised me about this is how lightweight this is.  </li>
            <li>My skincare professional recommended it.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive, but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>recently tried a product, from a different company, that came highly recommended for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a little thicker due to the 50 SPF, but it is not as greasy or shiny as most brands on the market.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well in combination with loose powder (in lieu of foundation).  </li>
            <li>Its the only sunscreen that does not burn my sensitive Rosacea skin on my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it keeps you from getting a dry face.</li>
            <li> wherever you want a little color, glow and big sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I want as little sun tan on my face as possible and this delivers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is as moisturizing as other brands, meaning if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or thick like a lot of other SPF moisturizers and it&#x27;s not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would help that (I only say that because it does not feel wet/greasy like most moisturizers, but it might be working just as well without that bad side effect).  </li>
            <li> Too bad I had to discontinue use, because it went on so smooth...</li>
            <li> The large red (painful)</li>
            <li> and I believe it is from the Green Tea in this product.  </li>
            <li> I was getting reminded me of when I tried a Green Tea moisturizer, which prompted me to check the ingredients in this for Green Tea-  </li>
            <li> Have occasionally used brand&#x27;s other projects as well; not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Picture and description lead me to believe it was coming in a small tub.  </li>
            <li> A pink rash that lasted for two days and an expensive product ended up in the trash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rather thick to apply.</li>
            <li> Now 73 and paying for all my stupid mistakes in the sun.  </li>

            <li> My dermatologist recommended this over Ohbayashi which I&#x27;ve been using for years. I prefer this reduces lines and wrinkles I&#x27;m on my third tube.</li>
            <li> This is a great moistuirizer and has a higher spf in it.  I love that as i a outdoors a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using revision skin care upon the advice of my aesthetician for 9 months.  This specific product, the moisturizer is wonderful.  It has a nice scent, and when applied provides just enough \\&quot;slip\\&quot; for foundation application, but never goes on greasy. Additionally, if you are makeup optional, the SPF 50 negates having to use any sunscreen. With the addition of the \\&quot;Brightening\\&quot; wash, \\&quot;Nectifirm\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Teamine\\&quot; eye treatment&amp;lt; I am experiencing smoother skin (I can feel the difference).  Would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Works well on my face as an all-around moisterizer and sun screen.  Not greasy.  Have occasionally used brand&#x27;s other projects as well; not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light and not greasy at all! You don&#x27;t need much so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Picture and description lead me to believe it was coming in a small tub.  It came in a tube, which is a little more wastefull.</li>
            <li> Great product as always fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful suncreen lotion.  This product works well under foundation.  Not greasing and absorbs well into skin so that foundation goes on as normal.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I will finish it but doubt I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my daughter and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I really like the SPF protection this product provides. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or white shade on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Gives fabulous protection from the sun without altering the way your makeup goes on after.  I first got this stuff from my dermatologist and was paying out the wazoo for it, so I&#x27;m loving buying it for a fraction of the cost on amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a 40-year-old female with oily/combination skin.  I bought Revision&#x27;s Nectifirm from a local cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and fell in love with it, so I decided to try a few more of their products.  I was in need of a high SPF lotion or cream because I live in Colorado where the sun is intense and the air is dry, and this stuff does the trick.  What surprised me about this is how lightweight this is.  It&#x27;s not heavy or thick like a lot of other SPF moisturizers and it&#x27;s not greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy, (almost chalk-like), white streaks on your face or have that stench that most high SPFs do.  It provides excellent moisturizing and SPF protection.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to become over-oily, (like a lot of products do).  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light, is perfect under makeup for every day wear.  This is the best spf 50 moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, it leaves no white cast on the skin like some high spf products do.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny or greasy, it&#x27;s very lightweight, yet moisturizes well, it&#x27;s perfect and I will continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist have recommended it and it works great for me and my daughter. Does what it suppose to do. I bit grease but bearable.</li>
            <li> Very light weight on your face but works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I used this product in the doctor&#x27;s office where I worked and recommended it.  It&#x27;s light, non-stinging and offers good coverage.</li>
            <li> Have liked the Revision Intellishade so decided to try this SPF 50 with no color. It goes on easily and has no unpleasant fragrance. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen/moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far. An aesthetician recommended the Revision 45 in Matte, so I tried that one first.  I didn&#x27;t like the 45 tinted one (only because I don&#x27;t like color rubbing off onto a tissue when I touch my face), but this non-tinted one is great. It does feel a little thicker due to the 50 SPF, but it is not as greasy or shiny as most brands on the market.  I am prone to acne and a shiny, oily face.  With this, my face feels smooth and it soaks in well. I don&#x27;t know if it is as moisturizing as other brands, meaning if you have dry skin I&#x27;m not sure if it would help that (I only say that because it does not feel wet/greasy like most moisturizers, but it might be working just as well without that bad side effect).  So far, no breakouts and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy my second tube. It is more expensive, but so worth it.  I have tried so many brands that caused acne and shine, or I felt like I had a plastic wrap on my face.  Also, many brands are only 30 SPF and I needed something stronger. This is the best find for me so far! ***UPDATE***  Starting breaking out and I believe it is from the Green Tea in this product.  The large red (painful) blemishes I was getting reminded me of when I tried a Green Tea moisturizer, which prompted me to check the ingredients in this for Green Tea-  and yep, there it was.  I stopped use and my face appears to be much better now.   3 Stars because I have very acne prone skin and this product will probably work great for most people.  Too bad I had to discontinue use, because it went on so smooth...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  My dermatologist originally suggested it.  I have very sensitive skin that likes to react to almost everything. While I don&#x27;t have blemish or oil issues, I do have this reaction problem.&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried a product, from a different company, that came highly recommended for sensitive skin.  Result?  A pink rash that lasted for two days and an expensive product ended up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products and will continue to try new things as they come out or I hear about them, but I always, always have a supply of of the multi-protection and it is the one product I use almost every day.  It&#x27;s gentle, creamy, non-greasy, goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly and completely.  It never causes any reaction with my (very fair) skin and I&#x27;ve never gotten a burn after being out in the sun.  This is really a very good product and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received as stated on time.  Do like the spf 50</li>
            <li> This product is great, not greasy  and it keeps you from getting a dry face. I use it everyday  and its great keeps my skin soft and it protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended.. Its the only sunscreen that does not burn my sensitive Rosacea skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will be the last product I buy for a daily moisturizer that includes the SPF 50.  I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week and am very pleased so far.  My dermatologist recommended this product for me as I have lots of AK&#x27;s on my face and chest from sun damage when I was a teenager.  Now 73 and paying for all my stupid mistakes in the sun.  So far much better than anything else I have tried which includes Oil of Olay, ROC, Neutrogena, Avon and Mary Kay to name a few.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best oil free daily facial moisturizer.  It gives your skin a great tone and balance, even in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician gave me a sample of this product to use as sunscreen during the drier months.  However, I liked it so much that I used it on many summer days, despite the high heat and humidity where I live.  It feels and smells great and has a lighter texture than many facial lotions with high SPF.  Good under makeup or instead of makeup, as it makes your skin look smooth and healthy.  This product works very well in combination with loose powder (in lieu of foundation).  Note that this product does not have a \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; it is more on the glow or shine side, but your skin will look healthier and feel softer with this product.  I have combination skin and find this product fine.  In areas of shine, like t-zone, I use it lightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revisions for several years and what I love most about it is the smooth consistentcy as I apply it, the moisturizing results, and  the SPF 50 protection I&#x27;m getting.I also have and like the tinted one..it&#x27;s a five star product for me!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sunscreen &amp; moisturiser for the face.  It blends into the skin perfectly &amp; does not leave any streaks. It is very good value.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> As described. Glad I found it as such a great price!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning for a moisturizer and SPF 50 for a sunscreen.  Then I&#x27;m protected all day long.</li>
            <li> My skincare professional recommended it.  It does have that  zinc oxide fell to it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best SPF lotion.  I&#x27;ve used others that leave your face greasy and later under foundation, your face appears oily, but not with this product.  I have the best complexion ever and this product was advised by a specialist and I&#x27;ve been using it for almot a year now.  It lasts about 2-3 month&#x27;s....depending on whether I apply it to my neck and chest area, like during the Summer months.</li>
            <li> I love this cream it has so much SPF protection not all creams have this, I recommend it, my skin felt and looked awesome.</li>
            <li> Its a very wonderful product, I was given a sample by my dermatologist and I fell in love with it. I have oily skin but it does&#x27;nt clog my pores at all, though its alittle greasy. I will highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I love this multi purpose day cream.  It hydrates and protects from sum.  I wish Revision made a day cream without the SPF so I could switch on the days I do not go out.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Moisturizes but not greasy.  Great undercover for make up of any kind.  I have tried many moisture/sunscreen  products but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This moistizer and SPF is just too much for hot days. I end up sweating the SPF into my eyes, which burns. Also if I get the Product too close to around my eyes my skin totally reacts. It becomes flaky and puffy.  Perhaps when the weather is much cooler and the chance of sweating the product off will be lower,  I will retry it.  My Dr. recommended it to me. The moistizer was good...like if it didn&#x27;t have sunscreen,  it&#x27;d be a great night time moistizer.</li>
            <li> I looked a long time for a good moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t sticky, oily or greasy.  My plastic surgeon recommended this one and I have been using it happily ever since.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, changed after my neck lift on advice from surgeon &amp; staff. Also use the neck product.</li>
            <li> good product.  amazon offered good price and delivered it promptly</li>
            <li> great product. it was recommended by my esthetician.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hiking, beach, etc. wherever you want a little color, glow and big sunscreen. I want as little sun tan on my face as possible and this delivers. It is not matte, doesn&#x27;t have huge coverage of blemishes but doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts. If you want more color use a tinted powder over your face after it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;. It is rather thick to apply.</li>
            <li> This was a sample tube not 1.7 ounces.  A sample tube for $38.00 really!</li>
            <li> easy to use and fit for dry days~</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist non greasy and great sun block</li>
    </ol>
