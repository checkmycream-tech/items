            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I love that I can wash this and store it with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the problem fast and gives you great breath.  </li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>It should have lasted many months because I have used the identical designed product before, which was given to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Gotta clean the tongue!</li>
            <li>have tried the other types and this is the best for me.</li>
            <li>nothing will clean your tounge better or keep breath fresher</li>
            <li>This product is great not only cause it cleans your tongue:</li>
            <li>And, I can&#x27;t believe they are charging the price they are for these, given how cheaply made they are.    </li>
            <li>They fit any tongue and mouth.  </li>
            <li>Both the rippled edge and straight edge clean your tongue thoroughly, and is a great substitute for the same product from BreathRx.</li>
            <li>This is what I was looking for and trust me there is no disappointment.</li>
            <li>I also like that they are colorful.    </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I definitely have cleaner breath and better taste in my mouth after using this product.  </li>
            <li>i will definetly buy more next year.</li>
            <li>I bought the product in Nov 2012 but started to use the first scraper a month ago.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work as promised, I regret spending my money on this, your toothbrush can do the same job or maybe even better</li>
            <li>These were bought from Amazon directly, and they delivered just as quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;10 years ago my dentist gave me one that looks exactly the same, it is still working fine and is very flexible after 10 years of usage.</li>
            <li>The thickness really helped.</li>
            <li>It covers the whole tongue unlike the stainless cleaners.  </li>
            <li>very sanitary.</li>
            <li>so i started to use the second scraper, and it cracked right away when i started to bent and use it!</li>
            <li>but I accidentally cracked the first one by bending it too far.</li>
            <li>I really like my old tongue scraper, which I can&#x27;t find anymore.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live and leave witout it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this type of tongue cleaner because they are light, flexible and flat and therefore compact enough to put in a purse or travel bag.</li>
            <li>An added plus is the ability to keep them clean with no little spaces to collect &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; which is nice during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li>My young son noticed the difference also.</li>
            <li>the soft ones on the back of the tooth brushes..</li>
            <li>I am super surprised and disappointed on the quality of this thing which cost so much for such cheap material!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you bend it a bit too far, it permanently creases because the plastic is too thin and cheap</li>

            <li> If you bend it a bit too far, it permanently creases because the plastic is too thin and cheap</li>
            <li> The Oolitt is a double sided scraper which makes it last twice as long.</li>
            <li> It gives you a choice of serrated or flat</li>
            <li> The first time i used it immediately cracks, couple days later it broke into 2 pieces right in the middle, making it impossible to use.</li>

            <li> product itself was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to press down too hard when you are cleaning or you may have a sore tongue for an hour.  </li>
            <li> The Supersmile is very dull and does not remove or scrape the residue the same way.  </li>
            <li> It was a thick green plastic.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t scrape too hard.</li>
            <li> but I like this design over the less expensive models</li>
            <li> They are very thin plastic, which feels uncomfortable on the tongue - a bit too sharp.  </li>
            <li> there is just few that sell them, too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> The product that I received was made out of very poor quality plastic, so it broke off after three times of use.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive and unattractive in colors.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe i just happen to get a bad one accidentally.</li>
            <li> having a close friend with bad breath problem, buy this and give as it comes in seceral colors.</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT TAKE OUT THE DIRTY that leads to bad breath!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for these forever.  Dentist gave me one and it broke after a while-  nothing will clean your tounge better or keep breath fresher</li>
            <li> Love this tongue cleaner!  It&#x27;s easy to use, strong, durable and works perfect.  I can&#x27;t believe the junk it scrapes off even after I have brushed.  I definitely have cleaner breath and better taste in my mouth after using this product.  Just be careful not to press down too hard when you are cleaning or you may have a sore tongue for an hour.  :). Great price for a product that is good for 3 months!</li>
            <li> AWESOME SELLER! MARVELOUS WONDERFUL ITEMS! This is what I was looking for and trust me there is no disappointment. Truly works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Hey everyone that is browsing for a product that cleans your tongue PERFECTLY:  Search no more!!!This is your product!!    This is the BEST tongue cleaner you will ever have!!!    Forget the others not dented...and the soft ones on the back of the tooth brushes..IT DOESNT TAKE OUT THE DIRTY that leads to bad breath!!!  EVERYONE SHOULD USE  IT DAILY!!!    This product is great not only cause it cleans your tongue: it saves friendships..marriage and gives you the confidence!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as promised, I regret spending my money on this, your toothbrush can do the same job or maybe even better</li>
            <li> Basically, these do the job.  So they have that going for them.  I also like that they are colorful.    Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like.  They are very thin plastic, which feels uncomfortable on the tongue - a bit too sharp.  The material doesn&#x27;t bend well into a U shape.  If you bend it a bit too far, it permanently creases because the plastic is too thin and cheap - then it&#x27;s ruined.  And, I can&#x27;t believe they are charging the price they are for these, given how cheaply made they are.    I really like my old tongue scraper, which I can&#x27;t find anymore.  It was a thick green plastic.  The thickness really helped.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and unattractive in colors.  Had them in white from my periodontist, ordered them about 5 years ago from another place, and like them.  These did not measure up.</li>
            <li> Gotta clean the tongue! It&#x27;s just like vacuuming a carpet, and these do the job.</li>
            <li> Works well but I accidentally cracked the first one by bending it too far. I love that I can wash this and store it with my toothbrush. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for what you get but I like this design over the less expensive models so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I want to give Amazon 5 Stars for their cutsomer service.&lt;br /&gt;The item was shipped to me but I did not receive it and they re-shipped it to me again at no charge.  I appreciate that level of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was not what I expected.  I googled Oolitt tongue scrapers to replace the one I purchased from my dentist and this came up.  I assumed it was the same company and/or a similar product but it is not the same at all.  The Oolitt is a double sided scraper which makes it last twice as long. It is made of thinner plastic which makes it scrape the surface of your tongue so that it removes all the residue sitting on it.  The Supersmile is very dull and does not remove or scrape the residue the same way.  I wish I could return them but I used one and am now stuck with the pack of 6.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of tongue cleaner for several years.  It covers the whole tongue unlike the stainless cleaners.  It gives you a choice of serrated or flat surface.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the other types and this is the best for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best tongue scraper out there.  It takes care of the problem fast and gives you great breath.  I would recommend this item to anyone.  It works.</li>
            <li> very sanitary. good quality, nice colors. i will definetly buy more next year. i love this product. there is just few that sell them, too bad</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try after reading reviews here at Amazon. These were bought from Amazon directly, and they delivered just as quickly. Both the rippled edge and straight edge clean your tongue thoroughly, and is a great substitute for the same product from BreathRx. What I like about this product from Supersmile is that you get 6 instead of 3. The color selection is a cosmetic feature, but that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the product performance.</li>
            <li> I like this type of tongue cleaner because they are light, flexible and flat and therefore compact enough to put in a purse or travel bag. They are just as effective and less expensive than other tongue scrapers, and for ease of use, I actually prefer these over other kinds of tongue scrapers. The only caveat is to test the amount of pressure you use so you don&#x27;t scrape too hard.</li>
            <li> I bought the product in Nov 2012 but started to use the first scraper a month ago. The first time i used it immediately cracks, couple days later it broke into 2 pieces right in the middle, making it impossible to use. I thought maybe i just happen to get a bad one accidentally. so i started to use the second scraper, and it cracked right away when i started to bent and use it! I am super surprised and disappointed on the quality of this thing which cost so much for such cheap material!&lt;br /&gt;10 years ago my dentist gave me one that looks exactly the same, it is still working fine and is very flexible after 10 years of usage. i want my money back, can someone tell me how?</li>
            <li> This pack of four tongue cleaners are a bit pricey, but they are the best of this type that I could find anywhere.  They are good quality and are an excellent choice if you are a tongue scraper!</li>
            <li> The product that I received was made out of very poor quality plastic, so it broke off after three times of use.  It should have lasted many months because I have used the identical designed product before, which was given to me by my dentist.  Therefore, I had to return the product.  I am waiting for the refund at the moment.</li>
            <li> the ONLY tongue cleaner that gives a thorough 100% refreshing clean - and in one swipe!! My young son noticed the difference also.</li>
            <li> Cannot live and leave witout it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When having a close friend with bad breath problem, buy this and give as it comes in seceral colors.</li>
            <li> These are the best tongue scrapers around.  They fit any tongue and mouth.  An added plus is the ability to keep them clean with no little spaces to collect &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; which is nice during cold and flu season.</li>
