            <li>My manicurist loved the polishes too.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive the nail polish, but I even more impressed with the customer service and professionalism of this company.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love these nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I really love these colors</li>
            <li>I love the nail Polish colors.</li>
            <li>Received 2 additional items, top coat and sparkle.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this collection.</li>
            <li>I received the 6 FSOG colors, a top coat and a silvery confetti color called So Elegant.</li>
            <li>I only use OPI Polish and this kit is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>it looks authentic in the bottle but after super close inspection of each bottle, they are counterfeit opi nail polish.</li>
            <li>If it was genuine the addresses would match.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the polish is amazing and they&#x27;re all highly pigmented!</li>
            <li>All the colors come one original box, wrapped well.</li>
            <li>Much faster than most.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and the polishes hold up like all my other OPI polishes do!</li>
            <li>However, after seeing what I know to be legitimate displays of these polishes in stores, I can assure you that these are indeed real and genuine OPI polishes.</li>
            <li>and I am not unhappy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The Glitter is amazing, the greys are good and all different and the red is a nice mature red.  </li>
            <li>The top coat especially!</li>
            <li>The polish goes on nice, just like my other OPI products.</li>
            <li>Great edgy colors from OPI!  </li>
            <li>They are definitely OPI, all the colors in the original box.</li>
            <li>The polish is high quality.</li>
            <li>Thats hard to say about alot of top coats</li>
            <li>If this OPI I would be surprised.</li>
            <li>I have over 400 OPI and China Glaze, and if this is fake OPI, it&#x27;s a really good knock off.</li>
            <li>You really cannot assume that it should be genuine OPI if it is less than half of what it should be.</li>
            <li>I was glad nothing was broken.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t look cheap or fake to me.</li>
            <li> It shows the nail polish on a fifty shades of grey display.</li>
            <li> If you look at the address on the box (which matches my other salon bought OPI polishes), it actually shows a warehouse that is labeled as OPI.  </li>
            <li> the sticker on the bottom of the bottle is not authentic and the writing on the back is not authentic either because real opi &#x27;s are from the Netherlands not &amp;#34;France.&amp;#34; do not buy.</li>
            <li> The labels have black writing (instead of the green ink that we all have come to know in recent years) and the font is different than before.</li>
            <li> Came a lot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Product, when compared to other OPI bottles I have does not match what is said on the bottles.</li>
            <li> and they are OPI, these other people are incorrect.</li>
            <li> The bottoms of the polishes does not match the bottoms of my other OPIs.</li>
            <li> Mine just came in a small white box.</li>
            <li> It was not very secure, and I smelled the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Contained 2 Dark side of the mood and missing the Silk Tie color</li>
            <li> They are AMAZING!!!Really Really beautiful!!!People that are saying that These are not OPI are sick in the head!!!Buy</li>
            <li> I know that people have said negative things about this product</li>
            <li> but I feel that I bought it under false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on OPI, so I cant say if these are real or fake from other reviews.</li>
            <li> And the sticker(s) on the bottom is wrong.</li>
            <li> Not to mention two of the names are wrong.</li>
            <li> horrible price, fake product.</li>

            <li> Product, when compared to other OPI bottles I have does not match what is said on the bottles. And the sticker(s) on the bottom is wrong. Not to mention two of the names are wrong. If this OPI I would be surprised. That being said it&#x27;s good nail polish. Will never order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I, like a lot of other buyers apparently, jumped the gun and immediately thought something was fishy with these polishes as soon as I received them. Something about the labels and the smell of the polish was just off. However, after seeing what I know to be legitimate displays of these polishes in stores, I can assure you that these are indeed real and genuine OPI polishes. For some odd reason, OPI decided to completely change the labels on the bottom of the polishes for this collection. The labels have black writing (instead of the green ink that we all have come to know in recent years) and the font is different than before. This doesn&#x27;t indicate a counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a great deal for all 6 polishes in the collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not OPI.  The bottles say made in France and the box it comes in says made in the Netherlands.  If it was genuine the addresses would match.  Incidentally, if you look up the address on the bottles, it is an apartment building.  If you look at the address on the box (which matches my other salon bought OPI polishes), it actually shows a warehouse that is labeled as OPI.  It looks as though the boxes they come in are official and the polish is not.  The font on the bottom of the bottle is not correct either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, the polish is really nice and I am not unhappy with my purchase.  You really cannot assume that it should be genuine OPI if it is less than half of what it should be.</li>
            <li> They are AMAZING!!!Really Really beautiful!!!People that are saying that These are not OPI are sick in the head!!!Buy them if u want a FSOG nail art!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on OPI, so I cant say if these are real or fake from other reviews. However, I did check out a site that shows fake polishes just to check, and these pass the test of being authentic. The polish goes on nice, just like my other OPI products. The names are correct on the bottom of the bottle. They don&#x27;t look cheap or fake to me. I think they are a great product &amp; cant wait to use all of them. An awesome addition to my polish collection.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nail polishes. I&#x27;ve been wearing Romantically Involved for over two weeks and I can wear it over and over again. The quality of the polish is amazing and they&#x27;re all highly pigmented!</li>
            <li> Thank you!! I was so excited to receive the nail polish, but I even more impressed with the customer service and professionalism of this company.  The product was A1 Quality!! THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and variety!!!</li>
            <li> I really love these colors</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> it looks authentic in the bottle but after super close inspection of each bottle, they are counterfeit opi nail polish. the sticker on the bottom of the bottle is not authentic and the writing on the back is not authentic either because real opi &#x27;s are from the Netherlands not &amp;#34;France.&amp;#34; do not buy. horrible price, fake product.</li>
            <li> I know that people have said negative things about this product but I like it.  I buy a lot of OPI nail polish and this is OPI nail polish.  Great seller.  I received it quickly.  Much faster than most.</li>
            <li> Love it! The top coat especially! It keeps the polish from chipping at all! Thats hard to say about alot of top coats</li>
            <li> Great edgy colors from OPI!  Loved ThemðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I  bought these polishes. They are definitely OPI, all the colors in the original box. I have tried them all and they are OPI, these other people are incorrect. This is a great value. My manicurist loved the polishes too.  I have been wearing polish for 43 years I would know if something wasn&#x27;t kosher.  All the colors come one original box, wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Amazing...just as I hoped it would be!</li>
            <li> I understand the people that are saying these are not tell OPI polishes. The bottoms of the polishes does not match the bottoms of my other OPIs.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this polish Thursday and have used 2 colors already. The polish is high quality. Brush is great. I have over 400 OPI and China Glaze, and if this is fake OPI, it&#x27;s a really good knock off. Great shipping, was packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the nail Polish colors. They look great on.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and OPI! It was a great purchase and the polishes hold up like all my other OPI polishes do!</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish but I feel that I bought it under false advertisement. It shows the nail polish on a fifty shades of grey display. Mine just came in a small white box.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Received 2 additional items, top coat and sparkle.  Love it. The only thing that concerned me was the packaging. It was not very secure, and I smelled the nail polish.  I was glad nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Contained 2 Dark side of the mood and missing the Silk Tie color</li>
            <li> Love this collection. The Glitter is amazing, the greys are good and all different and the red is a nice mature red.  Good set to have!!</li>
            <li> Great gift for the girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I received the 6 FSOG colors, a top coat and a silvery confetti color called So Elegant. These are not counterfeit products as some have suggested.</li>
            <li> I only use OPI Polish and this kit is beautiful.  I totally recommend.  Came a lot faster than expected.</li>
