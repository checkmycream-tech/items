            <li>This is better than a wide-tooth comb.</li>

            <li>my daughter has autism and it is usually a huge hassle to brush her hair and get all the knots out.</li>
            <li>The brush quality itself feels extremely cheap yet the prince is nothing but cheap.  </li>
            <li>She got excited because it did not pull her hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is meant for fine hair, but I thought I would try it even though she has more normal hair than her sister (whose is baby fine).</li>
            <li>nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter says its cool,  Mom loves how cooperative she is with it.</li>
            <li>It requires a bit of technique to take full advantage of it&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many, many different brushes now.</li>
            <li>The bristles wear out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The very FIRST brush through my hair...</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 7-year old daughter, who has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My 4 1/2 year old has very fine tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Works pretty much like any other good brush but cost more and was cheaply made and looks that way.</li>
            <li>And it is good for dry hair</li>
            <li>First review I have ever written!  </li>
            <li>The brush does however feel really nice on my head, it must be the different length bristles.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Works great and a lot less tears!</li>
            <li>Daughter loves the brush and it goes right through the tangles without hurting</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s pink, her favorite color!</li>
            <li>Works fairly well at detangling without upsetting my little one.  </li>
            <li>it works ok for my toddlers baby fine hair but its not worth $15.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and it does not brush my hair any better than just running my hand over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>It rips more hair out than a regular brush when trying to brush through tangles.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>INSTANT STATIC AND FRIZZ</li>
            <li>It went through my daughters &amp;#34;Rats&amp;#34; like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a regular brush you&#x27;d buy at the grocery.  </li>
            <li>She even tries to brush her own hair now.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay whatever because my girls hair gets do tangled.</li>
            <li>IT HURT more than a regular comb or brush.</li>
            <li>What is really funny is that know she brushes twice a day and carries it around the house all day.  </li>
            <li>I have/had Shingles on my head and this brush really helps!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair,  and it was like using a barbie brush.  </li>
            <li>But it worked miracles with my grandaughter&#x27;s silk fine hair which is a MAJOR pain to comb.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my daughters long fine hair that gets so tangly after a shower!</li>
            <li>I am not one to typically leave reviews for products, but this is amazing.</li>
            <li>I never was sure it was really dry inside.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that knots up and tangles constantly.  </li>
            <li>I still saw just as much hair in the brush as I did before....</li>
            <li>Great brush for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>There was a lot of hair in the brush when I finished, but honestly, I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>and they do absolutely nothing to get tangled out.</li>
            <li>These brushes really do work.  </li>
            <li>Works a bit better on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>but this really works.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not convinced that it detangles any better than any of the other brushes we&#x27;ve tried, and my daughter still complains that it hurts when I brush her hair with it.  </li>
            <li>It will barely go through your hair and it pulls out just as much hair as most regular brushes.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine and this detangles it with a minimum of breakage.  </li>
            <li>Trying to get my money back on the three I got (there was a special</li>
            <li>I likes this brush; my only complaint was that it seemed to cause more static...</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter hates having her hair brushed because of her fine hair tangling like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I dont feel it works any better than the brush I had at half the brush.</li>
            <li>Her older sister put one on her birthday list ha ha.</li>
            <li>red heads will love it especially.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
            <li>I told her I would just buy her one, along with a few more to keep around.</li>
            <li>I really does work!No more crying from my 3 year old about brushing her hair.</li>
            <li>Better than a regular bush for tangles on a sensitive scalp, but not quite the same as the commercials.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it all on my daughters long fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is a tangled mess-</li>
            <li>Only criticism is that I is a bit large.</li>
            <li>but the brush does feel a little cheap</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My 8yr old daughter with almost waist length hair loves it.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>They were completely out.</li>
            <li>This really does work as the commercial say.  </li>
            <li>We went through 3 other detangling brushes without much success...</li>
            <li>, I need a blue one for my older kid with think hair</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get all her hair brushed well without brushing it all on top and then again from underneath.  </li>
            <li>While it was $15 dollars, I figured if I could eliminate half the fighting, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush prongs bend easily with thick hair.</li>
            <li>but I think that The Wet Brush brand brushes work much better on wet hair and just as well on dry.  </li>
            <li>No better than any other brush on my four-year-old daughter&#x27;s very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Gently goes through tangles and knots with minimal hair loss.  </li>
            <li>After many fights, crying spells, and &amp;#34;Just forget it, your mom can do it when you go home!&amp;#34; moments, I broke down and ordered the Mercier.</li>
            <li>I saw one of these at my local store (different color but same brand and brush type - for fine hair) hoping to finally have something that would help tame my tangles</li>
            <li>and I was going to cut her hair up to her chin just so we could cut down on the time and agony it takes to get her ready.</li>
            <li>(she is 5 and has long fine hair that has some curl to it, especially if it&#x27;s humid or her hair got wet and air dried).  </li>

            <li> Her mom &amp; my niece called and raved about how it didn&#x27;t hurt for her to brush her hair, which looked like mesh between a rats nest &amp; dread locks (not a cool look for a 10 year old!).</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t long enough, unless you have a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting my 7 year old, who has hair down to her rear end, each time we have to brush out her hair.</li>
            <li> It does not reach past the first layer of hair and is harder to use.</li>
            <li> For an expensive brush it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The pink one works on my younger daughter with thinner hair, but I didn&#x27;t read the dang description</li>
            <li> No tears, no running, and only one &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; from daddy being rough.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t blow dry or style with it either because of the shape.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter prefers the brush on her dry hair rather than wet.</li>
            <li> just brushed her hair with this thing (and it was a tangled mess after soccer practice) and she didn&#x27;t flinch.</li>
            <li> For medium hair the bristles are harder.</li>
            <li> And it definitely does not smooth out hair like it shows on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> It was a fight to get her hair brushed everyday.  </li>
            <li> Plus she loves the glittery pink color too.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and pictured as a Michel Mercier Sparkle Detangling Brush Pink.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin hair, and this brush works worse than a comb in my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was never pretty.</li>
            <li> The other daughter didn&#x27;t flinch.</li>
            <li> She usually hide her other brushes so she would not have to get her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Brushed from the tips, slowly working up 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and is always getting tangled and this gently works the knots out.</li>
            <li> Maybe half that.</li>
            <li> It is an expensive brush that does nothing different from a regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> Its takes a few strokes to get out the knots, but you defiantly see less hair loss on your brush as well.</li>
            <li> She has very fine hair that tangles very badly.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be a little skinnier and not so wedge shaped.</li>
            <li> This brush is hollow hard plastic and when I washed the brush some water got inside it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> No more crying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle shape makes it kinda tough for both her and me to grip.</li>
            <li> no more crying and no more fuss.</li>
            <li> Usually gets tangled out painlessly.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about the brush in the past and decided not to buy the brush.</li>
            <li> No more screaming, no more tears, no more stress for me.</li>
            <li> Not really sure I like it</li>
            <li> So from past experience, if I can&#x27;t find something in a store, I go to Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to get it out.  </li>
            <li> Anything to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awkward to hold and the bristles started breaking by the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> I have tried in the past) and IT WORKED!</li>
            <li> The plastic of this brush is so thin, I felt like I was going to break it just squeezing the handle to pull it through my hair - which was hardly tangled.</li>
            <li> My children have very hard to brush hair all the time</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> NO more tears!!</li>
            <li> Poor kid, I decided to try this</li>
            <li> This is for thin hair and it does take the knots out.</li>
            <li> Alas though this brush did NOTHING to quell my tangled mane.</li>
            <li> Also another false statement.</li>
            <li> she has very thin hair and tends to get a snarly birds nest in the back that is painful to brush out.</li>
            <li> not impressed  still lost lots of hair</li>
            <li> Then I saw it at Bed Bath and Beyond and decided to give it a try before we made the commitment to cutting off all her hair.</li>
            <li> So i was desperate to buy another.</li>
            <li> Washing my hair is so unpleasant even with conditioner and leave-in de-tangling solution.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> She absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> My 3 year hated it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a horrible buy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing ROCKS! I bought this for my daugter, she HATES to brush her hair and I can&#x27;t blame her...she has very thin hair and tends to get a snarly birds nest in the back that is painful to brush out. Even if my wife would assist with a tortureous brushing before school, by the time she got home she had snarls galore. Poor kid, I decided to try this (you have NO idea how many detangling brushes, sprays etc. I have tried in the past) and IT WORKED! Like a charm! She even LIKES to brush her hair now! Her older sister put one on her birthday list ha ha. I told her I would just buy her one, along with a few more to keep around.</li>
            <li> Works great and a lot less tears!</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter... She absolutely hated it. Told me it doesn&#x27;t work like they said on TV. So her mother tried. Yup same thing. It rips more hair out than a regular brush when trying to brush through tangles. The teeth on the brush broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This brush works amazing on my daughters fine hair. Usually gets tangled out painlessly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7-year old daughter, who has very fine hair.  It was supposed to be a stocking stuffer for Christmas, but she woke up one morning with a rat&#x27;s nest on her head!  Gave her the brush and it worked wonders!  Took out all the tangles with ease and she didn&#x27;t complain once.  She said it was the best brush EVER!</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever owned! It glides through my hair like butter. Buy it you will not be disappointed. I will never be without it ever.</li>
            <li> It did not detangle as shown on TV  My granddaughter uses it for her doll hair brush</li>
            <li> The brush seems cheap/flimsy. When I brush my hair after drying it makes my hair fly away... The brush does however feel really nice on my head, it must be the different length bristles.</li>
            <li> works great on daughter hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my brush from Ralph&#x27;s. It does not reach past the first layer of hair and is harder to use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> excellent! makes my hair so much fuller</li>
            <li> I dont feel it works any better than the brush I had at half the brush. You can&#x27;t blow dry or style with it either because of the shape. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Wow. Works perfect for my girlfriend and leaves it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was a gift. Her mom &amp; my niece called and raved about how it didn&#x27;t hurt for her to brush her hair, which looked like mesh between a rats nest &amp; dread locks (not a cool look for a 10 year old!). They had tried a knock off, didn&#x27;t work. Niece bedazzled it &amp; sent us a pic she was so happy., LOL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all on my daughters long fine blonde hair. This so far is the very best! Happy mommy &amp; daughter!!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty much like any other good brush but cost more and was cheaply made and looks that way.</li>
            <li> Get for bottle blond hair when hair is so fragile. Love it</li>
            <li> My 8yr old daughter with almost waist length hair loves it. It is pretty and seems to work well. Fewer tears and complaints. My only complaint is that the handle shape makes it kinda tough for both her and me to grip. It needs to be a little skinnier and not so wedge shaped.</li>
            <li> I likes this brush; my only complaint was that it seemed to cause more static...I couldn&#x27;t mush of a difference than a regular hair brush. I still saw just as much hair in the brush as I did before....</li>
            <li> It broke in two pieces after 2weeks of using it. And it&#x27;s a horrible buy. My 3 year hated it. Detangling my foot, it felt like I was ripping my hair out</li>
            <li> worst brush ever! DOENST DO AT ALL WHAT IT SAYS IT SHOULD DO!! The very FIRST brush through my hair... INSTANT STATIC AND FRIZZ CAUSED BY THE BRUSH!! AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!! ANd YES I purchased the brush correct to my hair type!</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush. It went through my daughters &amp;#34;Rats&amp;#34; like a hot knife through butter. my daughter has autism and it is usually a huge hassle to brush her hair and get all the knots out. this brush is brilliant! I will buy another one just to have in case this one gets lost!</li>
            <li> This is for thin hair and it does take the knots out. For medium hair the bristles are harder. That&#x27;s the blue one. Its takes a few strokes to get out the knots, but you defiantly see less hair loss on your brush as well.</li>
            <li> was not like description</li>
            <li> Brush prongs bend easily with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Received package on time. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really does work!No more crying from my 3 year old about brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> No better than any other brush on my four-year-old daughter&#x27;s very fine hair. We&#x27;ve tried many, many different brushes now.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the brush and it goes right through the tangles without hurting</li>
            <li> Great brush for thin hair.  Only criticism is that I is a bit large.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  But it worked miracles with my grandaughter&#x27;s silk fine hair which is a MAJOR pain to comb. Parent and child were happy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Hairbrush, great buy</li>
            <li> Awesome. ..It actually WORKS</li>
            <li> DONT WORK AS SHOWN ON TV</li>
            <li> love this brush for tender heads. red heads will love it especially. recommend to others.</li>
            <li> We bought this product from a TV ad. We found that it only smoothed the surface of my daughter&#x27;s hair. Any attempt to press deeper caused hair damage.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is a tangled mess- it&#x27;s always been tangly and knotted since I was a child- to the point that I use to run and hide when it came time to brush my hair.  I saw one of these at my local store (different color but same brand and brush type - for fine hair) hoping to finally have something that would help tame my tangles and I gladly paid for it. Anything to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that I spent the money on it. The brush quality itself feels extremely cheap yet the prince is nothing but cheap.  Still- I held out hope that I had a cure to my tangled problem.  Alas though this brush did NOTHING to quell my tangled mane. I definitely do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this brush and can even brush her own hair with it fairly well (she is 5 and has long fine hair that has some curl to it, especially if it&#x27;s humid or her hair got wet and air dried).  However, I&#x27;m not convinced that it detangles any better than any of the other brushes we&#x27;ve tried, and my daughter still complains that it hurts when I brush her hair with it.  It&#x27;s better than a regular brush you&#x27;d buy at the grocery.  But the bristles are rather short so it&#x27;s hard to get all her hair brushed well without brushing it all on top and then again from underneath.  And it is good for dry hair but I think that The Wet Brush brand brushes work much better on wet hair and just as well on dry.  This brush is hollow hard plastic and when I washed the brush some water got inside it and it was hard to get it out.  I never was sure it was really dry inside.</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughter love it!</li>
            <li> Pay attention to which one you buy. The pink one works on my younger daughter with thinner hair, but I didn&#x27;t read the dang description, I need a blue one for my older kid with think hair</li>
            <li> I am not one to typically leave reviews for products, but this is amazing. I have been fighting my 7 year old, who has hair down to her rear end, each time we have to brush out her hair. There are always tears and yelling and it was never pretty. I finally decided to give this a try after seeing the commercials for it several times. While it was $15 dollars, I figured if I could eliminate half the fighting, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just brushed her hair with this thing (and it was a tangled mess after soccer practice) and she didn&#x27;t flinch. I thought she was making it up, so I called her sister in who has regular hair. This brush is meant for fine hair, but I thought I would try it even though she has more normal hair than her sister (whose is baby fine). The other daughter didn&#x27;t flinch. So, I tried it on mine. I have very thick hair. This brush worked with no problems and I didn&#x27;t flinch. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, It did break hair still. There was a lot of hair in the brush when I finished, but honestly, I don&#x27;t really care. I brushed my 7 year olds hair in 5 minutes with no tears or fighting. Well worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin hair, and this brush works worse than a comb in my hair.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 year old has very fine tangly hair. She screams and cries every time I brush her hair. She starts kindergarten next week and I was going to cut her hair up to her chin just so we could cut down on the time and agony it takes to get her ready. I had read the reviews about the brush in the past and decided not to buy the brush. Then I saw it at Bed Bath and Beyond and decided to give it a try before we made the commitment to cutting off all her hair. Well, I have to say I&#x27;m so glad I gave it try! It is like a miracle on her hair. No more screaming, no more tears, no more stress for me. She even tries to brush her own hair now. We couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Worst hairbrush ever. I bought them online and they do absolutely nothing to get tangled out. I was willing to pay whatever because my girls hair gets do tangled. Trying to get my money back on the three I got (there was a special and I figured we could all have our own brushes). What a waste of money and time.  If I could give it a -5 I would.</li>
            <li> Grandaughter loves it. No more crying.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this brush! no more crying and no more fuss.</li>
            <li> This brush does nothing of what it promises. It hurts my scalp when I brush and it says it helps to not lose any hair. Also another false statement. IT HURT more than a regular comb or brush. Do not purchase it.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter hates having her hair brushed because of her fine hair tangling like cotton candy. After many fights, crying spells, and &amp;#34;Just forget it, your mom can do it when you go home!&amp;#34; moments, I broke down and ordered the Mercier. The day it got here, she begged me to brush her hair. Plus, it&#x27;s pink, her favorite color! Brushed from the tips, slowly working up 1&amp;#34; at a time. No tears, no running, and only one &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; from daddy being rough. I cannot say enough good things about this magnificent brush!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The best brush my four year old daughter has ever had.  She will only brush her hair with this and nothing else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker. I don&#x27;t think this brush works any better or worse than any other.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter says its cool,  Mom loves how cooperative she is with it. Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine thin LONG hair! This brush works great! Love it!</li>
            <li> My children have very hard to brush hair all the time no matter what product we use.  These brushes really do work.  Still have to use detangler spray but the brush does help out a lot!</li>
            <li> Not really sure I like it</li>
            <li> it works ok for my toddlers baby fine hair but its not worth $15. Maybe half that. The bristle are really short so it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through the hair. And it definitely does not smooth out hair like it shows on the infomercial. nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> For an expensive brush it&#x27;s cheaply made. It works alright for tangles but it&#x27;s awkward to hold and the bristles started breaking by the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> I would give it no stars if I could. Do not waste your money on this. It will barely go through your hair and it pulls out just as much hair as most regular brushes. The plastic bristles on this are so short it probably would not even brush a short haired dog. I have fine thin hair and it does not brush my hair any better than just running my hand over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter prefers the brush on her dry hair rather than wet. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter who hates having her hair brushed. This brush is awesome!!! NO more tears!!</li>
            <li> Better than a regular bush for tangles on a sensitive scalp, but not quite the same as the commercials. It requires a bit of technique to take full advantage of it&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair is very thin and is always getting tangled and this gently works the knots out.</li>
            <li> Does get some of the snarls out. Not what its all  bragged up to be.</li>
            <li> Product worked great, my daughter had been trying to get me to buy one of these for her for a while now. Finally bought it for her and I should have bought it a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> First review I have ever written!  This brush is JUNK. Literally feels like something I bought at the dollar store.  I have very fine long hair,  and it was like using a barbie brush.  The plastic of this brush is so thin, I felt like I was going to break it just squeezing the handle to pull it through my hair - which was hardly tangled. I would never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well at detangling without upsetting my little one.  Works a bit better on wet hair.  Takes a bit of getting used to the shape of the handle.  The bristles wear out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter.  She has very fine hair that tangles very badly.  It was a fight to get her hair brushed everyday.  When this arrived I took it out and she started brushing.  She got excited because it did not pull her hair.  What is really funny is that know she brushes twice a day and carries it around the house all day.  She usually hide her other brushes so she would not have to get her hair brushed. I can highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
            <li> I already purchased this brush several months ago, then I lost it! So i was desperate to buy another. I even went to a AS Seen On TV store. They were completely out. So from past experience, if I can&#x27;t find something in a store, I go to Amazon. I usually find exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> This really does work as the commercial say.  My daughter has very fine hair and tangled were always a battle.  We went through 3 other detangling brushes without much success...but this really works.  The different lengths of bristles seem to make the difference.  Plus she loves the glittery pink color too.</li>
            <li> my wife love this brush</li>
            <li> it works.  but the brush does feel a little cheap</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, says it work great</li>
            <li> Dissatisfaction. It doesn&#x27;t what it promises. Plucked many strands of my hair. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughters long fine hair that gets so tangly after a shower!</li>
            <li> My daughter love it. I can actually get her to brush her hair with out fighting with her. YEA!</li>
            <li> It is an expensive brush that does nothing different from a regular hair brush. I bought it for my daughter and I still have to struggle to get her hair brushed with detangling spray.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and I like it.</li>
            <li> not impressed  still lost lots of hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that knots up and tangles constantly.  Washing my hair is so unpleasant even with conditioner and leave-in de-tangling solution. This is better than a wide-tooth comb. Gently goes through tangles and knots with minimal hair loss.  Buying another one to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> love this brush.  I have/had Shingles on my head and this brush really helps!</li>
            <li> This was bought for James P.&#x27;s wife:  My hair is long and fine and this detangles it with a minimum of breakage.  IT REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and pictured as a Michel Mercier Sparkle Detangling Brush Pink.  I will always recommend seller with great shipping and packaging.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t long enough, unless you have a buzz cut. Not worth the money.</li>
