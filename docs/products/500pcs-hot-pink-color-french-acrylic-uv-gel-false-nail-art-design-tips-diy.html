            <li> and they are long and realistic</li>

            <li> These are RED NOT HOT PINK.</li>
            <li> not hot pink, not even really pink.</li>
            <li> but i looked at the other colors thay have and the purple on here</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin colour</li>
            <li> Will order again just because I don&#x27;t hate the color, however, will have to order from another site to get an actual hot pink.</li>
            <li> All if the tips were not in shipment missing number 0 and number 2 and 4</li>
            <li> All sizes came, none missing.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t have to small indent/ledge that some tips have</li>
            <li> so not real happy. .</li>
            <li> Tired of waiting</li>
            <li> thought it might be wrong thing sent to me</li>
