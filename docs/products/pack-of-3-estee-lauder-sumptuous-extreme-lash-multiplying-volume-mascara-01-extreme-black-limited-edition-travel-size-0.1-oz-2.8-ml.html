            <li>and this is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>So glad to find these on line.  </li>
            <li>Glides on smooth, no stickiness!</li>
            <li>I love this travel size because it never dries out,</li>
            <li>I love the Estee Lauder mascara.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to 3 pieces, and ever new.</li>
            <li>Great size for traveling and for trying out before purchasing a larger size.</li>
            <li>Full volume and length with NO clumps.  </li>
            <li>5 stars for my favorite makeup brand for performance, longevity and being easy on sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>You only get one as sample in deptment store and now can get as many as like!  </li>
            <li>Easily can make my lashes look fake with a couple of layers; however I never use up my mascara in the recommended 6 month period after first use, so these were the perfect size for how I use my mascara - sporadically</li>
            <li>My first time trying this mascara</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>LOVE the smaller sized container.</li>
            <li>I am going on month #2.5 with my first tube.</li>
            <li>Loved this mascara at full size, and you&#x27;ll like it if you are looking for a dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend  and buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>l ove this make up product, its so Soft, comfortable, durable for a long time.</li>
            <li>Went back to the grocery store and bought a cheap brand that actually works.</li>
            <li>full size mascaras tend to dry out before you use the entire tube.  </li>
            <li>Priced at 3 for $15, even if it did start to clump, these three smaller containers would last much longer than the larger package (in total) and was about half the price.</li>

            <li> Nice. it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> Value purchase and great product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  No difference in my lashes- looked like I did not apply any at all.  I am giving it away and will not buy this again.  Went back to the grocery store and bought a cheap brand that actually works.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this mascara and it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used...and I have tried many! Would highly recommend  and buy again. I get compliments on my lashes ALL the time!</li>
            <li> So glad to find these on line.  You only get one as sample in deptment store and now can get as many as like!  This product stays on all day and looks great on your lashes!  Glides on smooth, no stickiness!</li>
            <li> I have tried them ALL and this is the absolute best!  Full volume and length with NO clumps.  I love this travel size because it never dries out, full size mascaras tend to dry out before you use the entire tube.  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the Estee Lauder mascara. I always use Estee Lauder make up. I received it sooner than I thought I would. It was a great price for the mascara and the shipping.</li>
            <li> Best mascara out there. I keep coming back to this brand after trying others. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great travel size. Love the mascara.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara at full size, and you&#x27;ll like it if you are looking for a dramatic look.  Easily can make my lashes look fake with a couple of layers; however I never use up my mascara in the recommended 6 month period after first use, so these were the perfect size for how I use my mascara - sporadically and I like to switch up brands depending on the look I am going for.</li>
            <li> Great service and this mascara is amazing! A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> when estee lauder discontinued the navy blue mascara I resorted, in somewhat an act of protest, to tryinga  cheaper brand for the sake of maintaining my signature blue lashes - however, my eyes swelled up within 2 weeks of trying the off-brand - a hard-earned lesson solidifies my loyalty to this brand. 5 stars for my favorite makeup brand for performance, longevity and being easy on sensitive eyes. love it!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> l ove this make up product, its so Soft, comfortable, durable for a long time.It&#x27;s good to 3 pieces, and ever new.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Made my eyes stinf and water sooo bad. I had to wash off immediately</li>
            <li> LOVE the smaller sized container.
