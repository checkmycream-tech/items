            <li>The balm itself smells great</li>

            <li>And, has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>ROSE to look like you have a child&#x27;s lips with a bit of Taylor Swift (it goes on red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice texture though.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>my lips - the stuff in the tube is a nice darkish color</li>
            <li>and I already own Burts Bees pomegranate chapstick (which is amazing).&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>Wish I could have liked this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for a fall/winter color.</li>
            <li>Nice color for brunettes with medium skin</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth going on.</li>
            <li>the tinted lip balm is all you need for soft beautiful color and it goes on like butter!!</li>
            <li>Gives a beautiful red tint and moisturizes very nicely</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>This lip balm moisturizes like no other lip balm I have tried...with beautiful color!  </li>
            <li>this product... nice color, nice moisture and no bad &amp;</li>
            <li>I use this lip balm as a top coat over lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I have most of the Burt&#x27;s Lip Balm colors, this is my favorite one to date.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging as well too.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Rose is the best, followed by Pink Blossom.</li>
            <li>I love it because of the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li>you want more color</li>
            <li>I went on Etsy and found wonderful sheer lip tints that make the grade and more.</li>
            <li>I do love the how the color looks on me, and the moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a better, cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li>Love this Burt&#x27;s Bees balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great look - so much so that I always now buy this product instead of lipstick.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a balm that had a good colorful</li>
            <li>I have found better products in the nearby dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>My friend got the cheaper  Nivea tinted lip balm and the color showed up much more, and stayed on for hours.</li>
            <li>I also love it as a gloss instead of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love it--</li>
            <li>Alos, it is not sticky or tacky, just nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This color is the best, sort if a darker red.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and replaces lipstick and Chapstick for me so 2 in 1!</li>
            <li>Love the texture of this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?  </li>
            <li>Somehow the perfect lip color in every way possible.</li>
            <li>I thought there&#x27;d be more color than that</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, and I love their products, and this balm is no exception.</li>
            <li>Unlike many Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms, this does not have a pronounced flavor.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful color!  </li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I think I love it more than Nivea&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li>My favorite product.</li>
            <li>Thank you washing machine and thank you Burt&#x27;s bees! :)</li>
            <li>This not only works as a great chap-stick, it&#x27;s also a good color.</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li>now I love it</li>
            <li>Love all the tinted lip balms.  </li>
            <li>Gives a hint of color that I love.</li>
            <li>I have tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and love this one too.  </li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>and I love the name.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have for many years.</li>
            <li>Such great products!</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moisturized and helps me feel confident on frumpy mom days</li>
            <li>Probably, my all-time favorite for a balm is Softlips, but I don&#x27;t like the color options on it.  </li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and it works to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate lip balm Burt&#x27;s Bees makes is a much better lip balm and has more pigment too.</li>
            <li>red dhalia suits best for those who have asia complexion like mine,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>more of darker skin.</li>
            <li>love it. :)</li>
            <li>The color and packaging was so lovely</li>
            <li>Put a bit more on to enhance that effect.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is currently my favorite lippie.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>The Burts Bees Shimmer lip color is much better.</li>
            <li>What I read made me think it was going to be more of a lipsticky balm.</li>
            <li>I think initially I was thinking in terms of lipstick, judging it for what it is, a tinted lip balm, then it was perfect!</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>I love how this is a my lips but better color but a bit darker.</li>
            <li>so I love this tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had more staying power but would still buy again.</li>
            <li>This lip balm feels better than most.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely.</li>
            <li>If you want a bunch of color, you can use a lip pencil and this on top and it will give you a nice rich shade.</li>
            <li>, I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Feels great, stays on well, and no icky taste at all.</li>
            <li>so so natural yet beautiful.</li>
            <li>They feel great and look more natural than lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Glides easily and does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I wear this more for a light tinted gloss than I do a moisturizing balm</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips comfortable and  healthy with a bit of color.</li>
            <li>The color is very flattering and it feels good on your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a medium red and is a great lipstick refresher, too.</li>
            <li>A bit of shrink wrap on the product to ensure it&#x27;s safe and clean would suffice, but I know I wouldn&#x27;t have paid what I did for this</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, a hint of color, easy to put on without a mirror.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that the tint in this chapstick would be so strong.  </li>
            <li>A very light shade and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>looks great on bare lips.</li>
            <li>There is no \\&quot;building up\\&quot; of color, as it doesn&#x27;t need much more than one swipe to have full coverage.</li>
            <li>I am the color of a fairly deep tan and have pigmented lips and this color shows up beautifully on my lips.</li>
            <li>SO happy to have found this lovely range that are smooth, longish lasting, no overt perfume smell and available in such lovely colours, My best one so far is Hibiscus!</li>
            <li>The color sample shown is accurate, and that is the color it appears immediately after application.  </li>
            <li>This product feels just like the Burts Bees lip balm - light but moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s primary purpose is to prevent and treat chapped lips.</li>
            <li>but I can put it on lightly</li>
            <li>I love the Fresh brand Lip Tint with SPF from Sephora.</li>
            <li>great buy from Amazon that I will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gloppy or sticky, just a really smooth balm that moisturizes and smooths.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and honestly don&#x27;t expect to get much use out of it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Feels light on the lips.  </li>
            <li>My lips never felt so good, and I have mature lips</li>
            <li>That being said, this is a luxurious-feeling balm with excellent color saturation -- not too much, but enough to have an impact!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the color of my lips intensified just the right amount with a healthy gloss.</li>
            <li>and it definitely has very nice color and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s not that for me, but it is a great sheer color in its own right.</li>
            <li>No, I was not pleased with this product despite the nice packaging and my great experiences with their Lip</li>
            <li>feels great on your lips, not full of cancer causing chemicals, and a great tint that makes my lips pop while looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>its smooth nothing so special about it</li>
            <li>First, I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>However on my lips, within 5 minutes it changes to a light, neutral red that looks good with my cool-toned complexion.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t add any color to my lips (though perhaps my lips have more color to start with than I realized, because wiping it off onto tissue proves it&#x27;s got a decent tint to it) and the texture wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a super light tint.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, nice and sheer!  </li>
            <li>I must be allergic to something in lipstick because if I use a normal lipstick, my lips will begin to crack and bleed, so Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products is pretty much the only thing I can use, but of all of their products, I have liked this the best.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a fair-toned, cool complexion, if that helps you).</li>
            <li>Goes on soft and smells yummy - not fruity just nice to my nose.  </li>
            <li>I have had several colors and all blend in to my skin and look good</li>
            <li>This is  an ok product but not what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok no matter how much you end up swallowing</li>
            <li>but without such good color choices &amp; at three times the price.)</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it was in a magazine that stated it was a really good RED lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned blond that leans towards cool tones and Red Dalhia looks freat on me.</li>
            <li>Plus it melted pretty easily.</li>
            <li>like I expected from Burt&#x27;s Bees with a nice tint to it. :)</li>
            <li>The quality of the balm is wonderful but the red color smears just like regular lipstick of which I do not wear.</li>
            <li>I think you get more actual color out of the Hibiscus one, but that shade is more orange/coral.</li>
            <li>light sheer color and nicely hydrating</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, and the red tint is very nice.</li>
            <li>It also feels more like lipstick than the burts bees pomegranate chap stick I normally wear.</li>
            <li>Very light in color and doesn&#x27;t stay on long  - a lip stain with a lip moisturizer would be better.</li>
            <li>I also own this in Hibiscus and like Red Dhalia better because it is more red.  </li>
            <li>smell/taste isn&#x27;t pleasant, but not really off-putting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much color (just a light tint), but does add shine.</li>
            <li>Love this all natural tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s applied to your lips it looks natural but better.</li>
            <li>Love the color and texture, it always leaves my lips smooth and without a waxy feeling afterwards tge only downside</li>
            <li>only a nice color for your lips.</li>
            <li>I tried them as a cheaper alternative to my Fresh Sugar lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up much on my lips because so many reviews say these aren&#x27;t very tinted, but maybe they bought lighter shades or something.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black Honey&amp;#34;, but cheaper and more natural.</li>
            <li>Red Dalhia really compliments fair complexions too.</li>
            <li>b&#x27;ful dark pink color, awesome buttery and light texture, my holy grail....</li>
            <li>Adds just a right amount of tint of color.</li>
            <li>It is all right here in this one product.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this lip balm, but in general I lean towards more natural products and makeup</li>
            <li>Most essential oils are irritants and I could no longer use my old favorite.</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth and not thick like a lipstick.</li>
            <li>I just notice that when my lips are feeling dry, I put it on and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>very moisturizing, nice to apply, sheer color.</li>
            <li>I like it, save the price and wish it were a tad more sheer.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>It gives a really nice amount of colour while not really covering up your lips (like a thicker lipstick would).</li>
            <li>A color that is universally pretty on anyone, I think.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and I love the red dahlia color which adds just a hint of color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, like many lip color products, the color migrates to the edge of my lips after a while</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty</li>
            <li>I wanted the color and chapstick to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>its ok product , my lips look the same !</li>
            <li>I think I have every color, but the Red Dhalia is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>or I can wear it on a hot date with my husband, win-win.</li>
            <li>FIRST TIMER FOR ME ON THE LIP BALM &#x27;THING&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to wear stain and put gloss on top, but I tried the Red Dahlia shade and now keep one in my purse and one at home.</li>
            <li>It seems intimidating, but is very wearable!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty pigmented lips</li>
            <li>I started to work in office instead of from home and at $20 a piece those Fresh tubes went fast from re-applying throughout the work day.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not greasy, not sticky, not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Perfect color for casual wear.</li>
            <li>just a nice flush of deep red like your lips are almost naturally this red and sexy :)</li>
            <li>My other favourite colours in the range are Rose and Hibiscus.</li>
            <li>However, the lip balm itself has a strange smell (almost like the kind of cheap &#x27;play&#x27; lip balm I received when I was younger)</li>
            <li>its cheap for its quality, it really enhances my natural lip color,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Red Dahlia looks really good on my Asian skin.</li>
            <li>Hibiscus has more pigment and is much brighter than Red Dahlia.  </li>
            <li>And the color, though very sparse, is pretty.</li>
            <li>It does require reapplying fairly often, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for an all-natural lip color.</li>
            <li>It is way better than their shimmer tinted balms because those always dry out my lips and runs out of my lip line like a clown</li>
            <li>A plastic tube-inside a large cardboard tube-held by a paper card?</li>
            <li>Light natural colors (Red Dahlia and Sweet Violet),</li>
            <li>love the smooth texture, slight tinting, spf and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite because I long ago gave up on looking decent when I leave the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tinted balm on the other hand is sheer, layer-able, smooth, and super comfortable.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing to complain about.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave too much color, just a tad.</li>
            <li>Very oily and feel greasy on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Smell like multi oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing i noticed is you have to go lightly.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much of it like a gloss or chapstick, because the color will get on your teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, but they really weren&#x27;t kidding about the &amp;#34;hint of color&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for her lips.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just much to worry</li>
            <li>lt&#x27;s really just a hint of color, so no mirror needed for application.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really payed much attention to how well it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have much color on your lips, then this won&#x27;t do much for you.  </li>
            <li>VERY CREAMY.</li>
            <li>It looks much much darker than it really is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into nudes that much</li>
            <li>Very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that was good for my lips, not sticky or drying, which would give me a natural looking blush of color on my lips as I don&#x27;t wear any makeup but would like my lips not so pale.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot, humid and salty environment and this really protects my lips.  </li>
            <li>It comes in several other colors, but if you want something a bit more dramatic, Red Dhalia is great without going over the top!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice in situations where I would normally use a lip balm but might like a little bit of color.</li>
            <li>It shows a bit more than the other tinted balm colors and seems to coordinate with almost anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful about buying cosmetics, because so many of them are chemical-laden.</li>
            <li>After I tried the first tube, I had to buy a few more as gifts</li>
            <li>It gives a very sheer, deep tint without looking overly &amp;#34;done up.&amp;#34; Honestly, it makes your lips look naturally tinted!</li>
            <li>As noted in my initial review (below) Hibiscus is true to the color show on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and looks pretty with my pale skin tone and dark hair.</li>
            <li>This particular color, however, is too brown for my taste.</li>
            <li>just adds a very tiny bit of sheer color to make lips look healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Still high quality chapstick, though.</li>
            <li>if the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; take is little more than a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>So, if you have some color on your lips to start with, this will just highlight it a little more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i have sensitive lips and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much i apply, there is no irritation&lt;</li>
            <li>it actually stayed on while i ate a whole meal..much better than revolon colorstay or other type lipstick.</li>
            <li>It gives your reviews a nice darker red shade without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will not be buying this product again, especially for the price I paid for it (likely more for the packaging than the actual product).</li>
            <li>This lip balm had basically the exact same color, taste and consistency as Cherry Chapstick, which I could have bought for 99 cents.</li>
            <li>A little more color than expected but price was right.</li>
            <li>I wish the color was just a little more there, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned, and I think it&#x27;s hard to wear red lipstick even with red clothing, but this sheer red color works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>:) I ordered one in Red Dahlia and it&#x27;s not too dark at all.</li>
            <li>love dark red lips</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees Red Dahlia shade has a little more red, but it is much more moisturizing than Black Honey.  </li>
            <li>Until yesterday, the only saving grace this item had was that it does moisturize to a certain extent.</li>
            <li>I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer which gives more recognizable color, but still subtle enough that I can put it on without a mirror.</li>
            <li>however appears to go on clear for me.  </li>
            <li>And I would like to know how a company that prides itself on being natural can justify the wasteful packaging.</li>
            <li>It seems to stay put for a lot longer, too, and at the end of the day, my lips are soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I do like that it is mostly natural also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients are: cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, olus (vegetable oil, huile vegetale), cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, candelilla cera (euphorbia cerifera wax, cire de candelilla), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, aroma (natural flavor), lanolin, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, cananga odorata flower wax, jasminum officinale (jasmine) flower wax, ammonium glycyrrhizinate, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza).</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft and supple, and all natural, so</li>
            <li>What no one has mentioned so far is the depth of color.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this lip tint.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is moisturizing and leaves behind a nice shade.  </li>
            <li>Most gloss stains are too purple, too red or too pale.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated it it because normal lipstick makes my lips too dry and chapstick offers no color.</li>
            <li>there is not a strong over powering sent or taste to it which to me is important since I am sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and slick on my dry lips.  </li>
            <li>they were super dry and cracked I don&#x27;t know what it is about this specific formula that makes my lips chop</li>
            <li>just enough tint that you know its there light on the lips and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dehydrating like lipstick, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any real balm effect either, excepting the first few minutes after applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive and can get melty, but I love.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Bert&#x27;s bees red dahlia.</li>
            <li>I got the Red Dhalia because of the high recommendation.</li>
            <li>Love the neutral, no make-up look and the Black Honey works well with Clinique&#x27;s Mocha Pink Blush and neutral eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>Not on par with the healing power of traditional peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees, so if you&#x27;re really chapped go back to basics (peppermint Burt&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>The red is strong, but not overwhelming like a lipstick.</li>
            <li>The product ends up being very runny; if you so much as brush up against it while putting the cap back on, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees like to say it is 100 percent natural, but yet it contains potentially harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I used to use another natural brand,but they not only changed their formula , they changed the shape of the container AND added PEPPERMINT oil to the ingredients!!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s barely visible on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use RED DAHLIA if you want a natural even toned set of puckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It barely has any color--my bf used it, and i didn&#x27;t even notice a difference.</li>
            <li>A soft, blushing red</li>
            <li>Maybe if you go completely without make-up this may work, but if you wear any makeup (i.e. BB cream or foundation), this will not give you enough color to balance out your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick girl and keep my use of any make up to a bare minimum</li>
            <li>I would definitely have given Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm in Red Dhalia five stars, but I do feel that for the price, the package should at least give you a bit more product for the money.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft for a while, but doesn&#x27;t last for hours.</li>
            <li>Just enough color and keep your lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li>The balm is definitely moisturizing leaves my lips soft.</li>
            <li>The way it feels on my lips is sublime, and I love the tint it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing on my extremely dry lips, is sheer enough to look natural, and stays on well for a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li>Gives a gorgeous color however it is not very moisturizing as other burts bees products are but the color payoff is subtle and</li>
            <li>previous favorite was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s tinted lip balm, discontinued a few years ago -- very similar to this</li>
            <li>I was afraid that the Red Dhalia would be too dark for my fair skin, but it just gives a slight tint, so it was fine.  </li>
            <li>In the Burt&#x27;s Bees official website this is listed under &amp;#34;Lip Color&amp;#34; giving the false illusion that it is more of a lipstick and bigger than it is.</li>
            <li>There is no flavor (which is fine with me) and no noticeable odor (I do have a poor sense of smell, and one review mentioned an odor).  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but very little color and not much staying power.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark hair, so the red provides a nice subtle tint that&#x27;s not too dramatic or weak.</li>

            <li> I have found better products in the nearby dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this color.</li>
            <li> My friend got the cheaper  Nivea tinted lip balm and the color showed up much more, and stayed on for hours.</li>
            <li> I also love it as a gloss instead of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> I love it--</li>
            <li> Alos, it is not sticky or tacky, just nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This color is the best, sort if a darker red.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and replaces lipstick and Chapstick for me so 2 in 1!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask?  </li>
            <li> Somehow the perfect lip color in every way possible.</li>
            <li> I thought there&#x27;d be more color than that</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, and I love their products, and this balm is no exception.</li>
            <li> Unlike many Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms, this does not have a pronounced flavor.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful color!  </li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I think I love it more than Nivea&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li> My favorite product.</li>
            <li> Thank you washing machine and thank you Burt&#x27;s bees! :)</li>
            <li> This not only works as a great chap-stick, it&#x27;s also a good color.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li> now I love it</li>
            <li> Love all the tinted lip balms.  </li>
            <li> Gives a hint of color that I love.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and love this one too.  </li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> and I love the name.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have for many years.</li>
            <li> Such great products!</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips moisturized and helps me feel confident on frumpy mom days</li>
            <li> Probably, my all-time favorite for a balm is Softlips, but I don&#x27;t like the color options on it.  </li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms.  </li>
            <li> I love the color and it works to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate lip balm Burt&#x27;s Bees makes is a much better lip balm and has more pigment too.</li>
            <li> red dhalia suits best for those who have asia complexion like mine,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> more of darker skin.</li>
            <li> love it. :)</li>
            <li> The color and packaging was so lovely</li>
            <li> Put a bit more on to enhance that effect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I like this much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is currently my favorite lippie.  </li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The Burts Bees Shimmer lip color is much better.</li>
            <li> What I read made me think it was going to be more of a lipsticky balm.</li>
            <li> I think initially I was thinking in terms of lipstick, judging it for what it is, a tinted lip balm, then it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> I love how this is a my lips but better color but a bit darker.</li>
            <li> so I love this tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had more staying power but would still buy again.</li>
            <li> This lip balm feels better than most.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The color is lovely.</li>
            <li> If you want a bunch of color, you can use a lip pencil and this on top and it will give you a nice rich shade.</li>
            <li> , I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Feels great, stays on well, and no icky taste at all.</li>
            <li> so so natural yet beautiful.</li>
            <li> They feel great and look more natural than lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Glides easily and does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I wear this more for a light tinted gloss than I do a moisturizing balm</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips comfortable and  healthy with a bit of color.</li>
            <li> The color is very flattering and it feels good on your lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a medium red and is a great lipstick refresher, too.</li>
            <li> A bit of shrink wrap on the product to ensure it&#x27;s safe and clean would suffice, but I know I wouldn&#x27;t have paid what I did for this</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, a hint of color, easy to put on without a mirror.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the tint in this chapstick would be so strong.  </li>
            <li> A very light shade and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> looks great on bare lips.</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;building up\\&quot; of color, as it doesn&#x27;t need much more than one swipe to have full coverage.</li>
            <li> I am the color of a fairly deep tan and have pigmented lips and this color shows up beautifully on my lips.</li>
            <li> SO happy to have found this lovely range that are smooth, longish lasting, no overt perfume smell and available in such lovely colours, My best one so far is Hibiscus!</li>
            <li> The color sample shown is accurate, and that is the color it appears immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> This product feels just like the Burts Bees lip balm - light but moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s primary purpose is to prevent and treat chapped lips.</li>
            <li> but I can put it on lightly</li>
            <li> I love the Fresh brand Lip Tint with SPF from Sephora.</li>
            <li> great buy from Amazon that I will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gloppy or sticky, just a really smooth balm that moisturizes and smooths.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and honestly don&#x27;t expect to get much use out of it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Feels light on the lips.  </li>
            <li> My lips never felt so good, and I have mature lips</li>
            <li> That being said, this is a luxurious-feeling balm with excellent color saturation -- not too much, but enough to have an impact!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color of my lips intensified just the right amount with a healthy gloss.</li>
            <li> and it definitely has very nice color and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s not that for me, but it is a great sheer color in its own right.</li>
            <li> No, I was not pleased with this product despite the nice packaging and my great experiences with their Lip</li>
            <li> feels great on your lips, not full of cancer causing chemicals, and a great tint that makes my lips pop while looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> its smooth nothing so special about it</li>
            <li> First, I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> However on my lips, within 5 minutes it changes to a light, neutral red that looks good with my cool-toned complexion.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add any color to my lips (though perhaps my lips have more color to start with than I realized, because wiping it off onto tissue proves it&#x27;s got a decent tint to it) and the texture wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a super light tint.  </li>
            <li> Love the color, nice and sheer!  </li>
            <li> I must be allergic to something in lipstick because if I use a normal lipstick, my lips will begin to crack and bleed, so Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products is pretty much the only thing I can use, but of all of their products, I have liked this the best.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a fair-toned, cool complexion, if that helps you).</li>
            <li> Goes on soft and smells yummy - not fruity just nice to my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have had several colors and all blend in to my skin and look good</li>
            <li> This is  an ok product but not what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok no matter how much you end up swallowing</li>
            <li> but without such good color choices &amp; at three times the price.)</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it was in a magazine that stated it was a really good RED lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned blond that leans towards cool tones and Red Dalhia looks freat on me.</li>
            <li> Plus it melted pretty easily.</li>
            <li> like I expected from Burt&#x27;s Bees with a nice tint to it. :)</li>
            <li> The quality of the balm is wonderful but the red color smears just like regular lipstick of which I do not wear.</li>
            <li> I think you get more actual color out of the Hibiscus one, but that shade is more orange/coral.</li>
            <li> light sheer color and nicely hydrating</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and the red tint is very nice.</li>
            <li> It also feels more like lipstick than the burts bees pomegranate chap stick I normally wear.</li>
            <li> Very light in color and doesn&#x27;t stay on long  - a lip stain with a lip moisturizer would be better.</li>
            <li> I also own this in Hibiscus and like Red Dhalia better because it is more red.  </li>
            <li> smell/taste isn&#x27;t pleasant, but not really off-putting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much color (just a light tint), but does add shine.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s applied to your lips it looks natural but better.</li>
            <li> Love the color and texture, it always leaves my lips smooth and without a waxy feeling afterwards tge only downside</li>
            <li> only a nice color for your lips.</li>
            <li> I tried them as a cheaper alternative to my Fresh Sugar lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up much on my lips because so many reviews say these aren&#x27;t very tinted, but maybe they bought lighter shades or something.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black Honey&amp;#34;, but cheaper and more natural.</li>
            <li> Red Dalhia really compliments fair complexions too.</li>
            <li> b&#x27;ful dark pink color, awesome buttery and light texture, my holy grail....</li>
            <li> Adds just a right amount of tint of color.</li>
            <li> It is all right here in this one product.</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this lip balm, but in general I lean towards more natural products and makeup</li>
            <li> Most essential oils are irritants and I could no longer use my old favorite.</li>
            <li> The consistency is smooth and not thick like a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I just notice that when my lips are feeling dry, I put it on and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> very moisturizing, nice to apply, sheer color.</li>
            <li> I like it, save the price and wish it were a tad more sheer.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty.</li>
            <li> It gives a really nice amount of colour while not really covering up your lips (like a thicker lipstick would).</li>
            <li> A color that is universally pretty on anyone, I think.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and I love the red dahlia color which adds just a hint of color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, like many lip color products, the color migrates to the edge of my lips after a while</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty</li>
            <li> I wanted the color and chapstick to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> its ok product , my lips look the same !</li>
            <li> I think I have every color, but the Red Dhalia is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> or I can wear it on a hot date with my husband, win-win.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIMER FOR ME ON THE LIP BALM &#x27;THING&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to wear stain and put gloss on top, but I tried the Red Dahlia shade and now keep one in my purse and one at home.</li>
            <li> It seems intimidating, but is very wearable!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty pigmented lips</li>
            <li> I started to work in office instead of from home and at $20 a piece those Fresh tubes went fast from re-applying throughout the work day.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not greasy, not sticky, not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Perfect color for casual wear.</li>
            <li> just a nice flush of deep red like your lips are almost naturally this red and sexy :)</li>
            <li> My other favourite colours in the range are Rose and Hibiscus.</li>
            <li> However, the lip balm itself has a strange smell (almost like the kind of cheap &#x27;play&#x27; lip balm I received when I was younger)</li>
            <li> its cheap for its quality, it really enhances my natural lip color,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Red Dahlia looks really good on my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> Hibiscus has more pigment and is much brighter than Red Dahlia.  </li>
            <li> And the color, though very sparse, is pretty.</li>
            <li> It does require reapplying fairly often, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for an all-natural lip color.</li>
            <li> It is way better than their shimmer tinted balms because those always dry out my lips and runs out of my lip line like a clown</li>
            <li> A plastic tube-inside a large cardboard tube-held by a paper card?</li>
            <li> Light natural colors (Red Dahlia and Sweet Violet),</li>
            <li> love the smooth texture, slight tinting, spf and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite because I long ago gave up on looking decent when I leave the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tinted balm on the other hand is sheer, layer-able, smooth, and super comfortable.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing to complain about.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave too much color, just a tad.</li>
            <li> Very oily and feel greasy on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Smell like multi oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing i noticed is you have to go lightly.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use too much of it like a gloss or chapstick, because the color will get on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, but they really weren&#x27;t kidding about the &amp;#34;hint of color&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for her lips.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just much to worry</li>
            <li> lt&#x27;s really just a hint of color, so no mirror needed for application.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really payed much attention to how well it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have much color on your lips, then this won&#x27;t do much for you.  </li>
            <li> VERY CREAMY.</li>
            <li> It looks much much darker than it really is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into nudes that much</li>
            <li> Very deceiving.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that was good for my lips, not sticky or drying, which would give me a natural looking blush of color on my lips as I don&#x27;t wear any makeup but would like my lips not so pale.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot, humid and salty environment and this really protects my lips.  </li>
            <li> It comes in several other colors, but if you want something a bit more dramatic, Red Dhalia is great without going over the top!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in situations where I would normally use a lip balm but might like a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> It shows a bit more than the other tinted balm colors and seems to coordinate with almost anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about buying cosmetics, because so many of them are chemical-laden.</li>
            <li> After I tried the first tube, I had to buy a few more as gifts</li>
            <li> It gives a very sheer, deep tint without looking overly &amp;#34;done up.&amp;#34; Honestly, it makes your lips look naturally tinted!</li>
            <li> As noted in my initial review (below) Hibiscus is true to the color show on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and looks pretty with my pale skin tone and dark hair.</li>
            <li> This particular color, however, is too brown for my taste.</li>
            <li> just adds a very tiny bit of sheer color to make lips look healthy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Still high quality chapstick, though.</li>
            <li> if the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; take is little more than a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> So, if you have some color on your lips to start with, this will just highlight it a little more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i have sensitive lips and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much i apply, there is no irritation&lt;</li>
            <li> it actually stayed on while i ate a whole meal..much better than revolon colorstay or other type lipstick.</li>
            <li> It gives your reviews a nice darker red shade without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will not be buying this product again, especially for the price I paid for it (likely more for the packaging than the actual product).</li>
            <li> This lip balm had basically the exact same color, taste and consistency as Cherry Chapstick, which I could have bought for 99 cents.</li>
            <li> A little more color than expected but price was right.</li>
            <li> I wish the color was just a little more there, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned, and I think it&#x27;s hard to wear red lipstick even with red clothing, but this sheer red color works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> :) I ordered one in Red Dahlia and it&#x27;s not too dark at all.</li>
            <li> love dark red lips</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees Red Dahlia shade has a little more red, but it is much more moisturizing than Black Honey.  </li>
            <li> Until yesterday, the only saving grace this item had was that it does moisturize to a certain extent.</li>
            <li> I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer which gives more recognizable color, but still subtle enough that I can put it on without a mirror.</li>
            <li> however appears to go on clear for me.  </li>
            <li> And I would like to know how a company that prides itself on being natural can justify the wasteful packaging.</li>
            <li> It seems to stay put for a lot longer, too, and at the end of the day, my lips are soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I do like that it is mostly natural also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients are: cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, olus (vegetable oil, huile vegetale), cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, candelilla cera (euphorbia cerifera wax, cire de candelilla), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, aroma (natural flavor), lanolin, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, cananga odorata flower wax, jasminum officinale (jasmine) flower wax, ammonium glycyrrhizinate, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza).</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips soft and supple, and all natural, so</li>
            <li> What no one has mentioned so far is the depth of color.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this lip tint.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is moisturizing and leaves behind a nice shade.  </li>
            <li> Most gloss stains are too purple, too red or too pale.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated it it because normal lipstick makes my lips too dry and chapstick offers no color.</li>
            <li> there is not a strong over powering sent or taste to it which to me is important since I am sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and slick on my dry lips.  </li>
            <li> they were super dry and cracked I don&#x27;t know what it is about this specific formula that makes my lips chop</li>
            <li> just enough tint that you know its there light on the lips and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dehydrating like lipstick, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any real balm effect either, excepting the first few minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive and can get melty, but I love.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Bert&#x27;s bees red dahlia.</li>
            <li> I got the Red Dhalia because of the high recommendation.</li>
            <li> Love the neutral, no make-up look and the Black Honey works well with Clinique&#x27;s Mocha Pink Blush and neutral eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> Not on par with the healing power of traditional peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees, so if you&#x27;re really chapped go back to basics (peppermint Burt&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> The red is strong, but not overwhelming like a lipstick.</li>
            <li> The product ends up being very runny; if you so much as brush up against it while putting the cap back on, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees like to say it is 100 percent natural, but yet it contains potentially harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I used to use another natural brand,but they not only changed their formula , they changed the shape of the container AND added PEPPERMINT oil to the ingredients!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s barely visible on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use RED DAHLIA if you want a natural even toned set of puckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It barely has any color--my bf used it, and i didn&#x27;t even notice a difference.</li>
            <li> A soft, blushing red</li>
            <li> Maybe if you go completely without make-up this may work, but if you wear any makeup (i.e. BB cream or foundation), this will not give you enough color to balance out your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick girl and keep my use of any make up to a bare minimum</li>
            <li> I would definitely have given Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm in Red Dhalia five stars, but I do feel that for the price, the package should at least give you a bit more product for the money.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft for a while, but doesn&#x27;t last for hours.</li>
            <li> Just enough color and keep your lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li> The balm is definitely moisturizing leaves my lips soft.</li>
            <li> The way it feels on my lips is sublime, and I love the tint it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing on my extremely dry lips, is sheer enough to look natural, and stays on well for a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li> Gives a gorgeous color however it is not very moisturizing as other burts bees products are but the color payoff is subtle and</li>
            <li> previous favorite was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s tinted lip balm, discontinued a few years ago -- very similar to this</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the Red Dhalia would be too dark for my fair skin, but it just gives a slight tint, so it was fine.  </li>
            <li> In the Burt&#x27;s Bees official website this is listed under &amp;#34;Lip Color&amp;#34; giving the false illusion that it is more of a lipstick and bigger than it is.</li>
            <li> There is no flavor (which is fine with me) and no noticeable odor (I do have a poor sense of smell, and one review mentioned an odor).  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but very little color and not much staying power.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark hair, so the red provides a nice subtle tint that&#x27;s not too dramatic or weak.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent/flavor is a little odd for me, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Also, I understand it&#x27;s just a tinted lip balm, but the color doesn&#x27;t show up very well, even with my lips being as pale as they</li>
            <li> it completely dried out my lips for days it took about four days for my lips to go back to normal</li>
            <li> Minus one star for no &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; and also because it is more expensive that Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip  Balm with Pomegranate Oil which appears to have the same effect for me as this tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> Suddenly, it was a really pretty subtle color.  </li>
            <li> I am that person who can wear very few lip colors, and I absolutely adore this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no different than the other Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizing Lip Balm, except more expensive.</li>
            <li> does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip balm, but its not worth paying double for this tinted one.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing without being too heavy and has just enough tint to add color and still look natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of a darker and natural color.</li>
            <li> Been a long time burt&#x27;s bees lip balm user.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would go in for a big wet slobbery kiss if I were wearing it though.</li>
            <li> Stays on long.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this product because lipstick is just to messy for my busy lifestyle</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy and looks natural.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on I did not love it, but a few weeks later I put it on with no expectations of how it was supposed to look.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is really no different than other tinted lip balms.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry lips</li>
            <li> The tube of Red Dahlia I received is brown with a slight reddish tint and definitely not similar to the the color shown on Amazon (I&#x27;m planning to request a refund due to inaccurate description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is I bought 4 other colors along with this one, and all the same issues hold true for each...and I wasted $35.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is less sheer than the Clinique.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not super fond of is the lipstick-like smell</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;d seen how little you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the color will be a little diff on everyone, on me it is a sheerish brown red or even a brown wine.</li>
            <li> wanted to love it so bad</li>
            <li> lip balm provodes only the barest amount of color, at least in the Red Dahlia.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much tint though.</li>
            <li> I tries the Bert&#x27;s</li>
            <li> not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it can feel a little bit tacky, unlike other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms.</li>
            <li> packaging is ridiculous, an outer package of cardboard and plastic and then inside that is a cardboard tube and inside that is a petite tube of balm, considerably smaller than a standard chapstick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re either heavy, sticky or dry out my already dry lips!</li>
            <li> it looks natural and subtle as it wears off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Being a dedicated Burt&#x27;s Bees customer for the past 4 years, and loving every single one of their products, I was sadly disappointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These lip balms contain aluminum - which has been linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s, ADHD and other brain disorders.</li>
            <li> Now I am extremely irked, because others can smell this burnt motor oil stench when I use it.</li>
            <li> I mean there is some color, but I can barely see a difference even when looking for it.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on dry lips and the added tint is just enough for subtle color.</li>
            <li> I have it in several shades and keep at least one in every spot I can (house, car, purse, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It never gets as dark as no tube.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing but has faint color.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY MOM, COLOR IS NOT AS DARK  </li>
            <li> The color of it in the tube looks intimidating but on it isnt that dark</li>
            <li> Considering how dark this color is, there is almost no color on my lips.</li>
            <li> Way prettier and sheerer color than Burt&#x27;s Bees Rhubarb Lip Shimmer which I find to be a little thick and slightly gritty.</li>
            <li> For years I purchased the somewhat pricey Clinique Black Honey Almost Lipstick.  </li>
            <li> I have Clinique&#x27;s Almost Lipstick Black Honey.</li>
            <li> You need 3 coats to get half of the color as seen on tube.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was listed as a dupe for Clinique&#x27;s Black Honey on a beauty blog</li>
            <li> Red dahlia is too sheer for me and the color hardly comes out in the thin layer of wax, smells like vanilla, not dahlias!</li>
            <li> It is definitely not smooth going on.</li>
            <li> My search for a less expensive product began and this Burts Bees Tinted Lip Balm finally hit the mark.</li>
            <li> While the Clinique has very little smell, this smells like motor oil.</li>
            <li> However, I see very little color when I put it on my lips.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to reaply often...</li>
            <li> It almost makes it pointless.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that red dhalia would be to dark</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the color</li>
            <li> Not sure about the taste/smell.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, but this reddish tint doesn&#x27;t wash me out like some reds tend to.</li>
            <li> Does not have hardly any color/tint.</li>
            <li> still can&#x27;t stand the smell or taste, but at least to my nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having this on hand tricks people into thinking I at least put on some lipstain.</li>
            <li> I never liked the way lipstick or glosses feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> It never feels cakey, goey or thick.  </li>
            <li> I mean it might replace my pomegranate chapstick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean feather out into wrinkles, just spread evenly.</li>
            <li> And this lip balm looks just as scary in the tube as the Black Honey, but don&#x27;t worry -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle color, like you&#x27;ve just eaten a juicy strawberry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad thing is that it is way to sheer.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m totally addicted to this creamy, moisturising product.</li>
            <li> It dried out my lips and the color was disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really weird.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> As lip balms go, this is an expensive one.</li>
            <li> product gets 2 stars because there&#x27;s nothing horrible about it, but only 2 because there&#x27;s nothing of value to me about it either.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this color.</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint and goes away after awhile</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as bad as when lipstick does this).</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this balm.</li>
            <li> I do like Burts Bees products, but I was disappointed in this balm.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like lip stick or lip gloss because I hate how it feels on my lips.  </li>
            <li> lipstick feels annoying to me</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this all natural tinted lip balm. Feels great, stays on well, and no icky taste at all.</li>
            <li> I use this lip balm as a top coat over lipstick.  It doesn&#x27;t have much color (just a light tint), but does add shine.</li>
            <li> These lip balms contain aluminum - which has been linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s, ADHD and other brain disorders. Burts Bees like to say it is 100 percent natural, but yet it contains potentially harmful ingredients. This makes me wonder if the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; take is little more than a marketing ploy. Take the alumina out Please.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balms! I have very pale skin, but this reddish tint doesn&#x27;t wash me out like some reds tend to. I have most of the Burt&#x27;s Lip Balm colors, this is my favorite one to date.</li>
            <li> For years I purchased the somewhat pricey Clinique Black Honey Almost Lipstick.  Love the neutral, no make-up look and the Black Honey works well with Clinique&#x27;s Mocha Pink Blush and neutral eye shadows.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees Red Dahlia shade has a little more red, but it is much more moisturizing than Black Honey.  And this lip balm looks just as scary in the tube as the Black Honey, but don&#x27;t worry - when it&#x27;s applied to your lips it looks natural but better. (I&#x27;m a fair-toned, cool complexion, if that helps you).</li>
            <li> Adds just a right amount of tint of color. The perfect amount of moisture too. I love the packaging as well too.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balms. This particular color, however, is too brown for my taste. It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s just not my fav. Rose is the best, followed by Pink Blossom.</li>
            <li> it completely dried out my lips for days it took about four days for my lips to go back to normal they were super dry and cracked I don&#x27;t know what it is about this specific formula that makes my lips chop but it&#x27;s really weird. stay away if you have supersensitive skin because I do and I can use the regular lip balms but not this one. wanted to love it so bad</li>
            <li> So moisturizing. Not much tint though. I love it because of the way it makes my lips feel. And, has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Been a long time burt&#x27;s bees lip balm user.  Not a big lipstick or lip gloss user so decided to try this.  Color is perfect as it gives a hint of color and not sticky.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long and I do need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> No, I was not pleased with this product despite the nice packaging and my great experiences with their Lip Shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm provodes only the barest amount of color, at least in the Red Dahlia.&lt;br /&gt;If you want more color I recommend their Lip Shimmer in Raisin. It&#x27;s more of a medium red and is a great lipstick refresher, too.</li>
            <li> I love it! Burt&#x27;s Bees has a customer for life. :) I ordered one in Red Dahlia and it&#x27;s not too dark at all.</li>
            <li> For the record, I purchased this lip balm at WM-and I did so based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon. I am extremely disappointed in this balm. I have Clinique&#x27;s Almost Lipstick Black Honey. I like it, save the price and wish it were a tad more sheer. Based on the reviews here, I thought this was going to be a great replacement. Wrong. This lip balm is less sheer than the Clinique. While the Clinique has very little smell, this smells like motor oil. And tastes somewhat like burnt oil. It is definitely not smooth going on. There is no \\&quot;building up\\&quot; of color, as it doesn&#x27;t need much more than one swipe to have full coverage. Which is what a LIPSTICK is for. And I would like to know how a company that prides itself on being natural can justify the wasteful packaging. A plastic tube-inside a large cardboard tube-held by a paper card? Really? Until yesterday, the only saving grace this item had was that it does moisturize to a certain extent. Now I am extremely irked, because others can smell this burnt motor oil stench when I use it. What&#x27;s worse is I bought 4 other colors along with this one, and all the same issues hold true for each...and I wasted $35. I went on Etsy and found wonderful sheer lip tints that make the grade and more. I hope this review helps others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1-19-15:&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t stand the smell or taste, but at least to my nose the scent fades. I don&#x27;t think I would go in for a big wet slobbery kiss if I were wearing it though. Being told your mouth smells like burnt whale balls could ruin the moment. I do love the how the color looks on me, and the moisture. My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth going on. The color is pretty. I think you can find it cheaper in big box stores.</li>
            <li> Love the color and texture, it always leaves my lips smooth and without a waxy feeling afterwards tge only downside is that it is a bit pricey and I usually have to reaply often...try bag balm i find it wonderful for my lips plus it comes in a big bin</li>
            <li> I stock up on these every time I go to the States. I used Mac tinted lipbalm for years until they discontinued it. This is a better, cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li> Love this Burt&#x27;s Bees balm. I suffer from dry lips so I&#x27;m totally addicted to this creamy, moisturising product. It gives a really nice amount of colour while not really covering up your lips (like a thicker lipstick would). It&#x27;s a great look - so much so that I always now buy this product instead of lipstick. My other favourite colours in the range are Rose and Hibiscus.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and the red tint is very nice. Lasts quite a while too. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I used to use another natural brand,but they not only changed their formula , they changed the shape of the container AND added PEPPERMINT oil to the ingredients!!  Most essential oils are irritants and I could no longer use my old favorite. SO happy to have found this lovely range that are smooth, longish lasting, no overt perfume smell and available in such lovely colours, My best one so far is Hibiscus!</li>
            <li> As lip balms go, this is an expensive one. I bought the red dahlia as it was the darkest/richest color and I wanted a balm that had a good colorful tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is ridiculous, an outer package of cardboard and plastic and then inside that is a cardboard tube and inside that is a petite tube of balm, considerably smaller than a standard chapstick. A bit of shrink wrap on the product to ensure it&#x27;s safe and clean would suffice, but I know I wouldn&#x27;t have paid what I did for this if I&#x27;d seen how little you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell/taste isn&#x27;t pleasant, but not really off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color just isn&#x27;t there. I mean there is some color, but I can barely see a difference even when looking for it. I wanted something that was good for my lips, not sticky or drying, which would give me a natural looking blush of color on my lips as I don&#x27;t wear any makeup but would like my lips not so pale. I have found better products in the nearby dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give my lips the soft smoothness that I expected. It&#x27;s not dehydrating like lipstick, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any real balm effect either, excepting the first few minutes after applying. So unless I want to use this every ten minutes or so, it&#x27;s not doing my lips any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 2 stars because there&#x27;s nothing horrible about it, but only 2 because there&#x27;s nothing of value to me about it either.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Glides easily and does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Have been using this lipstick, like the color of it and moist feeling, I will buy again.It meets the need of me.</li>
            <li> A color that is universally pretty on anyone, I think. It&#x27;s a little bit of a darker and natural color. It moisturizes my lips, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t show up really well, and barley stayed on for a few minutes. My friend got the cheaper  Nivea tinted lip balm and the color showed up much more, and stayed on for hours. I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip balm, but its not worth paying double for this tinted one.</li>
            <li> I have it in several shades and keep at least one in every spot I can (house, car, purse, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I love the smooth texture, slight tinting, spf and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing to complain about.  Use it for lip protection while running.  I live in a hot, humid and salty environment and this really protects my lips.  I also love it as a gloss instead of lipstick.  It is not sticky and I love the red dahlia color which adds just a hint of color</li>
            <li> This is my favorite because I long ago gave up on looking decent when I leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;Having this on hand tricks people into thinking I at least put on some lipstain.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing! The way it feels on my lips is sublime, and I love the tint it leaves behind. It doesn&#x27;t leave too much color, just a tad. I highly recommend Bert&#x27;s bees red dahlia. So awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great, moisturizing lip tint. Red Dahlia looks really good on my Asian skin. It&#x27;s subtle color, like you&#x27;ve just eaten a juicy strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like lip stick or lip gloss because I hate how it feels on my lips.  This product feels just like the Burts Bees lip balm - light but moisturizing.  It never feels cakey, goey or thick.  My hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on subscribe and save is amazing - $4,75 at the time of this writing.</li>
            <li> Hydrating and awesome like I expected from Burt&#x27;s Bees with a nice tint to it. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but wanted to leave a review because Amazon reviews were why I decided to give it a try!  I love it-- it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  If you&#x27;re like me and feel too &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; with lipstick, but want a hint of color-- this is for you!  It&#x27;s the color of my lips intensified just the right amount with a healthy gloss.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Great taste, Great smell. Stays on long. looks great on bare lips. just adds a very tiny bit of sheer color to make lips look healthy. i don&#x27;t like frost lipstick and so this is perfect. only a nice color for your lips. Alos, it is not sticky or tacky, just nice and smooth. it actually stayed on while i ate a whole meal..much better than revolon colorstay or other type lipstick. This is great to bring anywhere and you dont&#x27; need a mirror to put it on. love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, keeps my lips moisterized and the color is great!  The best tinted lip balm I have ever tried and I am a makeup junkie.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! It&#x27;s awesome! This color is the best, sort if a darker red. Very nice. Goes on smooth and replaces lipstick and Chapstick for me so 2 in 1!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this lip balm.  It is way better than their shimmer tinted balms because those always dry out my lips and runs out of my lip line like a clown face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it has no SPF (ALLERGIC TO THE SPF chemical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is that it is way to sheer. like  almost nothing with one cost.  You need 3 coats to get half of the color as seen on tube.  It never gets as dark as no tube. Bummer.  Wished I knew and would have gotten a way darker shade.</li>
            <li> WOW!  This lip balm moisturizes like no other lip balm I have tried...with beautiful color!  What more can you ask?  It seems to stay put for a lot longer, too, and at the end of the day, my lips are soft and moisturized.  There is no flavor (which is fine with me) and no noticeable odor (I do have a poor sense of smell, and one review mentioned an odor).  This is not a &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feeling lip balm, and it is not sticky.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> To me, this is the perfect lip balm. It is moisturizing without being too heavy and has just enough tint to add color and still look natural.  After I tried the first tube, I had to buy a few more as gifts and so I would have extra to put in my purses and makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Very oily and feel greasy on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Smell like multi oil.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it and not recommended.... . . . .  . .</li>
            <li> The quality of the balm is wonderful but the red color smears just like regular lipstick of which I do not wear. SO, If you already wear lipstick, I think this will not be a problem and you would give it a 5/5. My lips feel good but I don&#x27;t like cleaning the red off the non-lip area??</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this color. I actually bought two just in case I lose one. I have fair skin and dark hair, so the red provides a nice subtle tint that&#x27;s not too dramatic or weak. Somehow the perfect lip color in every way possible. The only thing i noticed is you have to go lightly. You can&#x27;t use too much of it like a gloss or chapstick, because the color will get on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. The color is very flattering and it feels good on your lips. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, like many lip color products, the color migrates to the edge of my lips after a while and I have to reapply or wipe it off to avoid having a colored ring around my mouth (althought the color is quite sheer so it&#x27;s not as bad as when lipstick does this). I do like that it is mostly natural also.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty but it is NOT hydrating. Plus it melted pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, but they really weren&#x27;t kidding about the &amp;#34;hint of color&amp;#34;. I thought there&#x27;d be more color than that but it&#x27;s barely visible on me. It almost makes it pointless.</li>
            <li> Scrap all your chapsticks. I&#x27;m chronically dehydrated (coffee junkie), and these are the only balms that actually keep my lips from &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; like clay in the desert from morning to night.  And they leave a tint-- Score!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use ROSE to look like you have a child&#x27;s lips with a bit of Taylor Swift (it goes on red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use RED DAHLIA if you want a natural even toned set of puckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovvvvvve this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have theses on subscribe and save.  I tried them as a cheaper alternative to my Fresh Sugar lip gloss.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive and can get melty, but I love.  I tries the Bert&#x27;s and now I have to have one in my purse all the time.</li>
            <li> I wish the color was just a little more there, it&#x27;s barely noticeable. Nice texture though. And the color, though very sparse, is pretty.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Perfect color and just the right amount of color. I have given up lipstick and lip moisturizer. It is all right here in this one product.</li>
            <li> Goes on soft and smells yummy - not fruity just nice to my nose.  I don&#x27;t see it &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; my lips - the stuff in the tube is a nice darkish color however appears to go on clear for me.  Minus one star for no &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; and also because it is more expensive that Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip  Balm with Pomegranate Oil which appears to have the same effect for me as this tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was listed as a dupe for Clinique&#x27;s Black Honey on a beauty blog I stumbled across. Sadly, it&#x27;s not that for me, but it is a great sheer color in its own right. It&#x27;s somewhat similar, but the color just isn&#x27;t a dupe on me. But it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, and I love their products, and this balm is no exception. The only problem I have with it is that it can feel a little bit tacky, unlike other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms. Also, the scent/flavor is a little odd for me, but not bad. Just different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime fan of sheer lipsticks, so I wanted to see how Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm compares. I found that this is truly a balm. It is very moisturizing but has faint color. I have the Red Dahlia, which I believe is the darkest shade. It&#x27;s nice in situations where I would normally use a lip balm but might like a little bit of color. It&#x27;s primary purpose is to prevent and treat chapped lips. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in place of a sheer lipstick. Even the Red Dahlia does not show up well on lips that are deeply pigmented, which is how I came by my mother&#x27;s stash. It didn&#x27;t do much for her lips. The balm is advertised as having \\&quot;100% Natural\\&quot; ingredients. There is no mention of SPF or sunscreen in any literature about this product, though titanium dioxide is listed under \\&quot;may contain\\&quot; ingredients. Unlike many Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms, this does not have a pronounced flavor. It contains lanolin, so beware if you are allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are: cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, olus (vegetable oil, huile vegetale), cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, candelilla cera (euphorbia cerifera wax, cire de candelilla), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, aroma (natural flavor), lanolin, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, cananga odorata flower wax, jasminum officinale (jasmine) flower wax, ammonium glycyrrhizinate, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza). May contain: alumina, CI 77891 (titanium dioxide), CI 75470 (carmine), CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499 (iron oxides).</li>
            <li> I like burts bees tinted lip balm. there is not a strong over powering sent or taste to it which to me is important since I am sensitive to scents. I have had several colors and all blend in to my skin and look good I was afraid that red dhalia would be to dark but I can put it on lightly and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful color!  It is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It barely has any color--my bf used it, and i didn&#x27;t even notice a difference. It is a great lip balm though! Would buy it just for that.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm. I think I love it more than Nivea&#x27;s lip balm. Definitely a must have in your purse/pocket.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.  It is a great Burt&#x27;s Bees product but the color and chapstick does not last very long.  I wanted the color and chapstick to last most of the day.  I did order another Burt&#x27;s Bees product that is called Burt&#x27;s Bees Shimmer in rhubarb and it definitely has very nice color and stays on all day.  This is  an ok product but not what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> Very light in color and doesn&#x27;t stay on long  - a lip stain with a lip moisturizer would be better.</li>
            <li> Love! Always in my purse and I always buy them for gifts. mositurizes wonderfully like the burts bee chapstick that I love with a great shade of color. A must have!</li>
            <li> My favorite product. Third time I have purchased this Chapstick. Thank you washing machine and thank you Burt&#x27;s bees! :)</li>
            <li> This not only works as a great chap-stick, it&#x27;s also a good color. It shows a bit more than the other tinted balm colors and seems to coordinate with almost anything.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees product. I thought I would try this product because lipstick is just to messy for my busy lifestyle and it&#x27;s just much to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dark red lips, I think it looks great on every skin tone but at the end of the day I would find it essentially smeared and smudged around my mouth and that&#x27;s not cute. I like chapstick because it hydrates you lips and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I was looking for lip stains this product came up, and I already own Burts Bees pomegranate chapstick (which is amazing).&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this item and hoping for a tint enough to make my lips pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get that. I have an Olive complexion and no tint. The balm itself smells great it hydrates amazingly I&#x27;m wearing it now I love it I mean it might replace my pomegranate chapstick BUT it did not tint my lips whatsoever and I wore it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why it got a 4 out of 5 great product but didn&#x27;t do what was advertised.</li>
            <li> its ok product , my lips look the same ! its smooth nothing so special about it</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect amount of color and moisture. It gives a very sheer, deep tint without looking overly &amp;#34;done up.&amp;#34; Honestly, it makes your lips look naturally tinted! The color is a very rich neutral wine and looks great paired with a smokey eye!</li>
            <li> Purchased hibiscus color. Not satisfied with the color but the balm is really good.</li>
            <li> Love all the tinted lip balms.  I think I have every color, but the Red Dhalia is my favorite.  I am fair-skinned, and I think it&#x27;s hard to wear red lipstick even with red clothing, but this sheer red color works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm ever. Gives a hint of color that I love.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and love this one too.  I was afraid that the Red Dhalia would be too dark for my fair skin, but it just gives a slight tint, so it was fine.  It feels nice and slick on my dry lips.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s best tinted lip balm.  It looks great on everyone.  I am that person who can wear very few lip colors, and I absolutely adore this one.  A soft, blushing red that&#x27;s great for daytime.</li>
            <li> Being a dedicated Burt&#x27;s Bees customer for the past 4 years, and loving every single one of their products, I was sadly disappointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best thing I like about this lip balm is the color of the tube it&#x27;s in, and the style of the packaging. However, the lip balm itself has a strange smell (almost like the kind of cheap &#x27;play&#x27; lip balm I received when I was younger) and if you happen to get any in your mouth, the taste is similar to licking an envelope. The product ends up being very runny; if you so much as brush up against it while putting the cap back on, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess. Also, I understand it&#x27;s just a tinted lip balm, but the color doesn&#x27;t show up very well, even with my lips being as pale as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will not be buying this product again, especially for the price I paid for it (likely more for the packaging than the actual product).</li>
            <li> lt&#x27;s really just a hint of color, so no mirror needed for application. Keeps my lips soft and supple, and all natural, so it&#x27;s ok no matter how much you end up swallowing</li>
            <li> I love the color and I love the name. This stuff works great and looks pretty with my pale skin tone and dark hair. It&#x27;s a winner! I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have for many years. Such great products!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this lip balm, but in general I lean towards more natural products and makeup so I wanted to take a chance.... And I am so glad I did! My husband immediately commented that he loved the color, score! It keeps my lips moisturized and helps me feel confident on frumpy mom days or I can wear it on a hot date with my husband, win-win. I don&#x27;t feel there are any cons and as I have used it daily for the last month I don&#x27;t foresee any, however I will update if any present themselves!</li>
            <li> Red Dhalia.  First, I love the smell of this.  I also like how it&#x27;s not too tacky.  There is a good bit of gloss.  I wear this more for a light tinted gloss than I do a moisturizing balm so I haven&#x27;t really payed much attention to how well it moisturizes.  I just notice that when my lips are feeling dry, I put it on and it feels nice.  Probably, my all-time favorite for a balm is Softlips, but I don&#x27;t like the color options on it.  As for the color, it&#x27;s incredibly sheer.  So, if you have some color on your lips to start with, this will just highlight it a little more.  If you don&#x27;t have much color on your lips, then this won&#x27;t do much for you.  Maybe if you go completely without make-up this may work, but if you wear any makeup (i.e. BB cream or foundation), this will not give you enough color to balance out your face.  I also own this in Hibiscus and like Red Dhalia better because it is more red.  I think you get more actual color out of the Hibiscus one, but that shade is more orange/coral.</li>
            <li> Good for the lips.  Works as described.</li>
            <li> re-order - luv this product... nice color, nice moisture and no bad &amp;#34;lipstick taste&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> best stuff out there&lt;br /&gt;i have sensitive lips and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much i apply, there is no irritation&lt;br /&gt;great light sheer color and nicely hydrating</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF!  FIRST TIMER FOR ME ON THE LIP BALM &#x27;THING&#x27;.  VERY CREAMY. I WOULD PURCHASE THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms.  They feel great and look more natural than lipstick.  Better for you too!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It dried out my lips and the color was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BURTS BEES!!!! the tinted lip balm is all you need for soft beautiful color and it goes on like butter!! My lips never felt so good, and I have mature lips ha.I also wear this over my regular lipstick for a glossy lip.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY MOM, COLOR IS NOT AS DARK  AS IT SHOWS,</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear stain and put gloss on top, but I tried the Red Dahlia shade and now keep one in my purse and one at home. What no one has mentioned so far is the depth of color. I am the color of a fairly deep tan and have pigmented lips and this color shows up beautifully on my lips. Most gloss stains are too purple, too red or too pale. This is perfect. And the price is right.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is moisturizing and leaves behind a nice shade.  This darkish mauve color would look great on anyone.</li>
            <li> I buy this on Subscribe and Save. I love the color and it works to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> Really love this color on me!  It seems intimidating, but is very wearable!  Feels good and is moisturizing on the lips.</li>
            <li> It gives your reviews a nice darker red shade without feeling heavy. It does require reapplying fairly often, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for an all-natural lip color. I&#x27;m very careful about buying cosmetics, because so many of them are chemical-laden. I opted for Burt&#x27;s Bees because it received one of the best ratings from the Environmental Working Group for chemicals for lipstick. I really appreciated it it because normal lipstick makes my lips too dry and chapstick offers no color. This is the perfect solution!</li>
            <li> This lip balm had basically the exact same color, taste and consistency as Cherry Chapstick, which I could have bought for 99 cents. The pomegranate lip balm Burt&#x27;s Bees makes is a much better lip balm and has more pigment too.</li>
            <li> Gives a gorgeous color however it is not very moisturizing as other burts bees products are but the color payoff is subtle and so so natural yet beautiful. I wear this every day.</li>
            <li> its cheap for its quality, it really enhances my natural lip color,&lt;br /&gt;and its not so watery or greasy, just right.&lt;br /&gt;and red dhalia suits best for those who have asia complexion like mine,&lt;br /&gt;but more of darker skin. love it. :)</li>
            <li> I received my hibiscus lip tint in the mail today and it&#x27;s great! I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up much on my lips because so many reviews say these aren&#x27;t very tinted, but maybe they bought lighter shades or something. I have pretty pigmented lips and this showed up on mine almost to the point of looking like lipstick. It also feels more like lipstick than the burts bees pomegranate chap stick I normally wear. Overall, I really like this lip tint. The only thing I&#x27;m not super fond of is the lipstick-like smell</li>
            <li> The color and packaging was so lovely, I was very excited to try it. Red dahlia is too sheer for me and the color hardly comes out in the thin layer of wax, smells like vanilla, not dahlias! Wish I could have liked this.</li>
            <li> I love the Fresh brand Lip Tint with SPF from Sephora. It is truly a tint not a want-a-be lipstick so you dont need a mirror to apply, it keeps a nice flush of color on the lips, and it is wonderfully moisturizing. I started to work in office instead of from home and at $20 a piece those Fresh tubes went fast from re-applying throughout the work day. My search for a less expensive product began and this Burts Bees Tinted Lip Balm finally hit the mark. The only difference is it doesnt have SPF but since I am using it in doors that doesnt bother me. I am a fair skinned blond that leans towards cool tones and Red Dalhia looks freat on me. The color of it in the tube looks intimidating but on it isnt that dark just a nice flush of deep red like your lips are almost naturally this red and sexy :) Put a bit more on to enhance that effect. Great lip balm going to collect more colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick girl and keep my use of any make up to a bare minimum (Chapstick and mascara are my only daily duo) I never liked the way lipstick or glosses feel on my lips. They&#x27;re either heavy, sticky or dry out my already dry lips! This stuff however is perfect! A very light shade and super moisturizing. Not sticky or heavy and looks natural. Love love love it! I have amedium complexion and got the red dahlia. It looks much much darker than it really is. Goes on very sheer leaving a rosey tint.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Light natural colors (Red Dahlia and Sweet Violet), and there&#x27;s no burn to it like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer.  I like this much better.</li>
            <li> Comparison of HIBISCUS &amp; RED DAHLIA:  Hibiscus has more pigment and is much brighter than Red Dahlia.  As noted in my initial review (below) Hibiscus is true to the color show on Amazon.  The tube of Red Dahlia I received is brown with a slight reddish tint and definitely not similar to the the color shown on Amazon (I&#x27;m planning to request a refund due to inaccurate description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orginal review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in HIBISCUS.  The color sample shown is accurate, and that is the color it appears immediately after application.  However on my lips, within 5 minutes it changes to a light, neutral red that looks good with my cool-toned complexion.  Think the color it changes to would look good on anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is currently my favorite lippie.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing on my extremely dry lips, is sheer enough to look natural, and stays on well for a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My previous favorite was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s tinted lip balm, discontinued a few years ago -- very similar to this but without such good color choices &amp; at three times the price.)</li>
            <li> Love the color, its a blush of color that is just perfect! I love the price too! great buy from Amazon that I will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It works wonders on dry lips and the added tint is just enough for subtle color.</li>
            <li> love, love, love love!!!!!! I use it as a lipstick. Gives a beautiful red tint and moisturizes very nicely</li>
            <li> A little more color than expected but price was right.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but very little color and not much staying power.  The Burts Bees Shimmer lip color is much better.</li>
            <li> I would definitely have given Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm in Red Dhalia five stars, but I do feel that for the price, the package should at least give you a bit more product for the money. That being said, this is a luxurious-feeling balm with excellent color saturation -- not too much, but enough to have an impact! It&#x27;s not gloppy or sticky, just a really smooth balm that moisturizes and smooths. It comes in several other colors, but if you want something a bit more dramatic, Red Dhalia is great without going over the top! Love it! (Burt&#x27;s Bees, please make the package more generous!)</li>
            <li> Perfect for a hint of color, you can touch up anytime and sooth your chapped lips.  Not on par with the healing power of traditional peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees, so if you&#x27;re really chapped go back to basics (peppermint Burt&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, a hint of color, easy to put on without a mirror. I keep it in my pocket when I go out at night rather than carry a lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the tint in this chapstick would be so strong.  I was pleasantly surprised. The red is strong, but not overwhelming like a lipstick. The consistency is smooth and not thick like a lipstick. It keeps my lips soft for a while, but doesn&#x27;t last for hours. I don&#x27;t mind re-applying throughout the day, though. It&#x27;s nice for a fall/winter color. I will probably switch to a lighter color for spring.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for what it is.  I ordered it because it was in a magazine that stated it was a really good RED lip balm.  This is really no different than other tinted lip balms.  What I read made me think it was going to be more of a lipsticky balm.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add any color to my lips (though perhaps my lips have more color to start with than I realized, because wiping it off onto tissue proves it&#x27;s got a decent tint to it) and the texture wasn&#x27;t my favorite. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and honestly don&#x27;t expect to get much use out of it.</li>
            <li> Best tinted lip balm of all time. It&#x27;s the perfect color, it moisturizes your lips, and (unlike lipstick) it looks natural and subtle as it wears off at the end of the day. I use this daily until it&#x27;s gone, and then buy another tube!</li>
            <li> just enough tint that you know its there light on the lips and long lasting.  All of the  Burt&#x27;s Bees  products are  reliable superior.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on I did not love it, but a few weeks later I put it on with no expectations of how it was supposed to look.  Suddenly, it was a really pretty subtle color.  I think initially I was thinking in terms of lipstick, judging it for what it is, a tinted lip balm, then it was perfect! Although the color will be a little diff on everyone, on me it is a sheerish brown red or even a brown wine. od in me It reminds me of a brown-red or a brown wine.  If you want to protect your lips with a bit of color then you will like this.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Saw it being used on utube.</li>
            <li> feels great on your lips, not full of cancer causing chemicals, and a great tint that makes my lips pop while looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use!</li>
            <li> I love how this is a my lips but better color but a bit darker. I&#x27;m not into nudes that much so I love this tinted lip balm. I take off one star only because I don&#x27;t necessarily like glossy things on my lips and this does get glossy. But otherwise it is hydrating and I can quite put my finger on the scent but it&#x27;s  not disruptive. The scent is very faint and goes away after awhile and it doesn&#x27;t taste like the smell. I don&#x27;t like how the maybelline baby lips smell/tastes and this doesn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> Like it.  Goes on smooth.  Perfect color for casual wear.</li>
            <li> Just enough color and keep your lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a super light tint.  I have bought burt bees tints before and you could actually see the color.  This one, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for the longest while. They are so awesome, I like the fact that I dont need lipstick and my lips keep moist.</li>
            <li> Love the color, nice and sheer!  Just wish it had more staying power but would still buy again.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, nice to apply, sheer color.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time.  It&#x27;s the only make-up I use.  Keeps my lips comfortable and  healthy with a bit of color.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not greasy, not sticky, not heavy.  Feels light on the lips.  Nice color for brunettes with medium skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Most lipstick feels annoying to me &amp; I want to remove it soon.  This lip balm feels better than most.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It is the perfect shade for everything I wear. It gives your lips just a hint of color. If you want a bunch of color, you can use a lip pencil and this on top and it will give you a nice rich shade. I must be allergic to something in lipstick because if I use a normal lipstick, my lips will begin to crack and bleed, so Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products is pretty much the only thing I can use, but of all of their products, I have liked this the best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it religiously.</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully. The color is lovely. I prefer it over lipstick now. I urge others to buy this.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black Honey&amp;#34;, but cheaper and more natural. Red Dalhia really compliments fair complexions too.</li>
            <li> b&#x27;ful dark pink color, awesome buttery and light texture, my holy grail....best of both the worlds....color and feel......no lipstick can beat this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 out of 5 stars because of the color it only lasts for a while. The balm is definitely moisturizing leaves my lips soft.</li>
            <li> perfect color. I&#x27;m fair with cool undertones and it is the best color on me. Way prettier and sheerer color than Burt&#x27;s Bees Rhubarb Lip Shimmer which I find to be a little thick and slightly gritty. The tinted balm on the other hand is sheer, layer-able, smooth, and super comfortable. It&#x27;s color that you don&#x27;t have to keep checking in a mirror. Effortless.</li>
            <li> Great colors, and softens and protects the lips as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my aim, but the color seems to spread beyond my lips. I don&#x27;t mean feather out into wrinkles, just spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the texture. Not sure about the taste/smell. Will probably try again, perhaps another color.</li>
            <li> Considering how dark this color is, there is almost no color on my lips. It smells like lipstick and tastes like lipstick, but looks like there&#x27;s nothing there.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize though. I&#x27;m still going to use it like chapstick.</li>
            <li> Does not have hardly any color/tint. It&#x27;s no different than the other Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizing Lip Balm, except more expensive. In the Burt&#x27;s Bees official website this is listed under &amp;#34;Lip Color&amp;#34; giving the false illusion that it is more of a lipstick and bigger than it is. Very deceiving.  I do like Burts Bees products, but I was disappointed in this balm.</li>
            <li> I got the Red Dhalia because of the high recommendation. However, I see very little color when I put it on my lips. Almost unrecognizable. I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer which gives more recognizable color, but still subtle enough that I can put it on without a mirror. Still high quality chapstick, though.</li>
            <li> Good quality, will recommend it to my friends.</li>
