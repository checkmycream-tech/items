    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s for people with perfect, flawless skin.</li>
            <li>If you have perfect, flawless skin, you wouldn&#x27;t wear foundation anyway.</li>
            <li>Glides on perfectly, doesnt settle in my creases or eye wrinkle.</li>
            <li>very happy with this.</li>
            <li>great  product!</li>
            <li>So keeping that in mind, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>There is a perfect shade for all skin tones and racial types in this product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect lightweight coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>This color matches my complexion perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is great-</li>
            <li>It provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a great beauty product.</li>
            <li>It covers beautifully, blends easily, and dries to look indistinguishable from flawless skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, once I found my shade it did a good job of giving a matte look on my nose</li>
            <li>But you would have to have really really good skin already in order for this to look good on skin.</li>
            <li>I always use primer and a beauty blender and good at disguising any skin issues, but there was just nothing I could do to help this out.</li>
            <li>Even glides on top of my concealer!</li>
            <li>This foundation is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also nice is that it&#x27;s SPF 18 and that it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>More liquid than anticipated but smooth feel and perfect for using as an alternative to BB cream for a more matte finish.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Nude Liquid Powder does everything it promises, and more!</li>
            <li>I loved the way it made her skin look so smooth and healthy, yet without ever looking like a &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; layered on her own skin at all.</li>
            <li>I love It, absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I actually love a lot of their products.  </li>
            <li>It covers nicely for light coverage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>the better.</li>
            <li>so like with most makeup, you will have to reapply throughout the day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check your favorite fashion magazine and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s website for coupons.</li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars because I love the product...</li>
            <li>While I love the way this feels when it goes on (hence the 3 stars), it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of going from a liquid to a powder.</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>I do love the movie, but not the look.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>The Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid-Touch Foundation worked a LOT better for me.</li>
            <li>Product arrived 3 days earlier than estimate - am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good grasp of my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use &amp; light once it&#x27;s on!</li>
            <li>skin gets oily as the day goes on, but Magic Nude doesn&#x27;t streak or spot and didn&#x27;t cake in my cheek hollows or fine lines</li>
            <li>Normally I stick to high priced foundations like Face Atelier and Makeup Forever or imported BB Creams, but this stuff is MARVELOUS.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light, sheer coverage matte finish with SPF, this is great.</li>
            <li>This is really uniquely light foundation which goes on as a liquid</li>
            <li>It makes the complexion smooth and is like it says--to the feel--liquid powder.</li>
            <li>part of the name by feeling light and not goopy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on really smooth, it has a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feel to your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Dab this liquid foundation on your face, and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that felt light, but</li>
            <li>And then I realized it looked Orange in sunlight or fluorescent light, neither of which I had been applying this under, nor looked in a mirror with.</li>
            <li>The feel is powdery and light.</li>
            <li>I have seen beauty gurus on youtube rave about this but for me it is far too chemically to feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I just thought someone might need a real review that doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a magic fix all of makeup.</li>
            <li>It makes your face into a smooth, fresh, evenly-shaded palette for your blush, eye makeup and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again with primer and see how it wears through a full day, but I&#x27;m not too hopeful.</li>
            <li>At first I loved the semi-matte sheer light coverage it gave me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super watery and covers nothing.  </li>
            <li>This product is my latest favorite facial skin appearance enhancer!</li>
            <li>As I get older more imperfections appear in my skin.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, after volleyball practice (about an hour of mildly sweating), I went in the locker room to find a looked like an Oompa Loompa.</li>
            <li>OMG... I have found a new love.</li>
            <li>Magic Nude is by far my favorite, and I will switch over to it completely when my winter and spring shades run out.</li>
            <li>I use many different lines of cosmetics, from the drugstore brand to department store, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foundation.</li>
            <li>First, the shades tend to run darker than they appear.</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals for years and enjoyed it, but I was feeling ready for a change.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I tend to actually have to use powder after about an hour because my skin starts to look oily.</li>
            <li>Just recently bought this at my local Big Lots for $4.....went back and bought 2 more because this is one of the best foundations I have ever used.</li>
            <li>On top of all of that, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>I recently have been apply with my Sigma F80 makeup brush and works fine.</li>
            <li>Only light coverage...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>IT also really smooths out your face (within reason).</li>
            <li>It really does feel as if you&#x27;re wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really even out my skin very well.</li>
            <li>Idk I don&#x27;t really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>own several different brands of foundations because my skin tone changes with the seasons.  </li>
            <li>It gives you such a natural clean and fresh look.</li>
            <li>After reading glowing reviews here and in various magazines, I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes and dark spots much better than my heavier foundation.</li>
            <li>it blends quickly and definitely lives up to the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The liquid is not thick like foundation at all-it&#x27;s like water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of the bb and cc creams out there!</li>
            <li>but in this case it doesn&#x27;t even matter: this stuff works, hands down, and is perfect for someone like me who wants a little bit of makeup but doesn&#x27;t want to go overboard.</li>
            <li>bottle is quite small, but you have to use so little to get great coverage it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a pain to wash completely off.  </li>
            <li>I got this because it reminded me of the old Pore Minimizer makeup from Clinique.</li>
            <li>And it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you aren&#x27;t sweating with this on or can find a non-orangey shade to match your skin tone and don&#x27;t have very problematic skin, try it out.</li>
            <li>not at the cost of making me look older (I&#x27;m only 30!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is decent but not for me...</li>
            <li>only wish it came in more colours as the palest is a little too yellow for me</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin so outside of summer</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more coverage without a heavy cream.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>(admittedly I am a very unusual bluish shade of extremely pale, think printer paper</li>
            <li>l&#x27;oreal within minutes had settled into every tiny line on my face, even ones I didn&#x27;t know I had, and barely evened my skintone at all.</li>
            <li>I spent no time on this, just doing both with quick swipes of my bare fingers with small amounts, just enough to cover my face.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel caky or thick, Bought my first bottle Jan 7th and have PLENTY left now that we are into February already.</li>
            <li> I found this little wonder after reading an XOjane article and new</li>
            <li> Although I did loose the cap right after opening, (it&#x27;s SOOOO small!)</li>
            <li> It highlights any dry skin you may have and settles in pores.</li>
            <li> It goes on as a liquid, but is dry and silk-like.</li>
            <li> foundation will settle into every pore and line and bit of dry skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Then it was just gone with a couple cakey little creases left to remind me</li>
            <li> SPF&lt;br /&gt;Colors were as expected with no oxidation or color change throughout wear&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried putting this on half of my face and my no7 lifting and firming foundation on the other half, both sides without primer, just to compare it to my current foundation.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other side, it looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [One might use a cover stick beforehand on dark circles or blemishes.]</li>
            <li> The less I have to put on my face,</li>
            <li> I have freckles and a few acne scars</li>
            <li> However, it came halfway full because it spilled in transit :(</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s way, way too pale</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care enough about makeup to want to go for the expensive stuff</li>

            <li> Only light coverage...</li>
            <li> This foundation is amazing. It gives you such a natural clean and fresh look. It does not even feel like you are wearing any makeup! I love It, absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Although the color was right, the coverage was awful.  It&#x27;s super watery and covers nothing.  I have freckles and a few acne scars and it was like wearing nothing. It highlights any dry skin you may have and settles in pores. It&#x27;s for people with perfect, flawless skin. If you have perfect, flawless skin, you wouldn&#x27;t wear foundation anyway. It&#x27;s also a pain to wash completely off.  Now, I did not buy this on Amazon and this is no reflection of the seller or L&#x27;Oreal.  I actually love a lot of their products.  I purchased this at Target and shall be returning it soon.  I just thought someone might need a real review that doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a magic fix all of makeup.</li>
            <li> OMG... I have found a new love. For years Ive been using Almay. Using with a sponge to apply to face. This foundation is thin. The bottle tells you to apply with finger tips and they arent lying! A little bit goes a long way! I recently have been apply with my Sigma F80 makeup brush and works fine. I apply 2 coats every morning. Glides on perfectly, doesnt settle in my creases or eye wrinkle. Even glides on top of my concealer! very happy with this. Doesn&#x27;t feel caky or thick, Bought my first bottle Jan 7th and have PLENTY left now that we are into February already. 1 bottle would normally last atleast 2 months... great  product!</li>
            <li> This is really uniquely light foundation which goes on as a liquid and then changes to a powdery finish. It covers nicely for light coverage. [One might use a cover stick beforehand on dark circles or blemishes.]</li>
            <li> This product is my latest favorite facial skin appearance enhancer! A friend of mine recommended it to me. I loved the way it made her skin look so smooth and healthy, yet without ever looking like a &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; layered on her own skin at all. It makes the complexion smooth and is like it says--to the feel--liquid powder. It goes on as a liquid, but is dry and silk-like. No stickiness, no grease, no oil, and yet is sheer-coverage. I LOVE this product. Can not say enough about it. It even has a sun protection factor of 18 times, so: No need for a layer of sunscreen underneath it too. The less I have to put on my face, the better. Saves time and money. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is so tough for me to find foundation that works with my skin. Either it&#x27;s way, way too pale and I end up looking like my face is the color of a sheet of white paper or it&#x27;s too dark and difficult to blend. This is great- it blends quickly and definitely lives up to the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; part of the name by feeling light and not goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read somewhere (xojane maybe??) that this was something that a celebrity&#x27;s makeup artist recommended and I can see why. I don&#x27;t care enough about makeup to want to go for the expensive stuff but in this case it doesn&#x27;t even matter: this stuff works, hands down, and is perfect for someone like me who wants a little bit of makeup but doesn&#x27;t want to go overboard.</li>
            <li> I got this because it reminded me of the old Pore Minimizer makeup from Clinique. First, the shades tend to run darker than they appear. Also, the coverage is thin. The liquid is not thick like foundation at all-it&#x27;s like water. That said, once I found my shade it did a good job of giving a matte look on my nose and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I keep it in my purse/desk for touch-ups. Also nice is that it&#x27;s SPF 18 and that it comes in a glass bottle. If you&#x27;re looking for a light, sheer coverage matte finish with SPF, this is great. It&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of the bb and cc creams out there!</li>
            <li> I found this little wonder after reading an XOjane article and new I had to try it.  After trying it, I am AMAZED.  Normally I stick to high priced foundations like Face Atelier and Makeup Forever or imported BB Creams, but this stuff is MARVELOUS.  It covers beautifully, blends easily, and dries to look indistinguishable from flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in more colours as the palest is a little too yellow for me (admittedly I am a very unusual bluish shade of extremely pale, think printer paper and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good grasp of my skin tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy it in a second colour for using when I&#x27;ve had a fake tan or for contouring,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quite small, but you have to use so little to get great coverage it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This foundation is different from anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have used Bare Minerals for years and enjoyed it, but I was feeling ready for a change. As I get older more imperfections appear in my skin. I wanted a little more coverage without a heavy cream.&lt;br /&gt;This L&#x27;Oreal product is as thin as water (watch out when you pour it into your hand), yet gives my skin a glow and hides imperfections!  Follow instructions and shake well before opening. Apply with fingers, not a brush. So quick and easy. I gave some to my daughter. She was amazed also.</li>
            <li> More liquid than anticipated but smooth feel and perfect for using as an alternative to BB cream for a more matte finish.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying it&#x27;s drugstore makeup so no, you will not look like an airbrushed model. So keeping that in mind, this stuff is awesome! Goes on really smooth, it has a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feel to your fingertips. It provides great coverage. It covers blemishes and dark spots much better than my heavier foundation. IT also really smooths out your face (within reason). I&#x27;m usually disappointed in makeup, but this stuff really comes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: tends to appear darker on your skin... which can give you an orangey look. If between 2 shades, go lighter.&lt;br /&gt;It does wear off after awhile so like with most makeup, you will have to reapply throughout the day</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Nude Liquid Powder does everything it promises, and more! It really does feel as if you&#x27;re wearing nothing at all. Dab this liquid foundation on your face, and smooth. That&#x27;s all there is to it. It dries instantly to a powder that you can&#x27;t feel and it&#x27;s invisible to the eyes. The only proof you&#x27;re wearing it at all is your now-even skin tone. It makes your face into a smooth, fresh, evenly-shaded palette for your blush, eye makeup and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets oily as the day goes on, but Magic Nude doesn&#x27;t streak or spot and didn&#x27;t cake in my cheek hollows or fine lines (I&#x27;m middle-aged). It didn&#x27;t streak, melt away, cake or turn orangey when I was sweating outdoors. There is a perfect shade for all skin tones and racial types in this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several different brands of foundations because my skin tone changes with the seasons.  Magic Nude is by far my favorite, and I will switch over to it completely when my winter and spring shades run out. I use many different lines of cosmetics, from the drugstore brand to department store, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foundation. I bought the Sand Beige, and can&#x27;t wait to try the lighter ones for winter and darker for summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check your favorite fashion magazine and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s website for coupons. I can usually find one for $1 to $3 off for L&#x27;Oreal face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars!</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars because I love the product... I just wish L&#x27;OREAL WOULD STOP ANIMAL TESTING!&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched to another foundation after hearing the horrific things they do to laboratory animals.</li>
            <li> I tried putting this on half of my face and my no7 lifting and firming foundation on the other half, both sides without primer, just to compare it to my current foundation. I spent no time on this, just doing both with quick swipes of my bare fingers with small amounts, just enough to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The l&#x27;oreal within minutes had settled into every tiny line on my face, even ones I didn&#x27;t know I had, and barely evened my skintone at all. Compared to the other side, it looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because it has sunscreen and I wanted something that felt light, but not at the cost of making me look older (I&#x27;m only 30!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again with primer and see how it wears through a full day, but I&#x27;m not too hopeful.</li>
            <li> After reading glowing reviews here and in various magazines, I was excited to try this. While I love the way this feels when it goes on (hence the 3 stars), it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; my skin at all. It sinks into the pores in my T-zone and looks pretty terrible. On top of that, I tend to actually have to use powder after about an hour because my skin starts to look oily. And it doesn&#x27;t really even out my skin very well. Sad to say it&#x27;s a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is so fragile，they all broken</li>
            <li> Idk I don&#x27;t really like this stuff. I have seen beauty gurus on youtube rave about this but for me it is far too chemically to feel good on the skin. I love the concept of going from a liquid to a powder. But you would have to have really really good skin already in order for this to look good on skin. Overall I think this product is decent but not for me...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use &amp; light once it&#x27;s on! And it looks natural. It&#x27;s a simple fix when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. At first I loved the semi-matte sheer light coverage it gave me. And then I realized it looked Orange in sunlight or fluorescent light, neither of which I had been applying this under, nor looked in a mirror with. Furthermore, after volleyball practice (about an hour of mildly sweating), I went in the locker room to find a looked like an Oompa Loompa. I do love the movie, but not the look. Overall, if you aren&#x27;t sweating with this on or can find a non-orangey shade to match your skin tone and don&#x27;t have very problematic skin, try it out. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this! The feel is powdery and light. Although I did loose the cap right after opening, (it&#x27;s SOOOO small!) I still like the product it&#x27;s self!</li>
            <li> Just recently bought this at my local Big Lots for $4.....went back and bought 2 more because this is one of the best foundations I have ever used. It is very lightweight and has great coverage.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Has SPF&lt;br /&gt;Colors were as expected with no oxidation or color change throughout wear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;This foundation will settle into every pore and line and bit of dry skin on your face. I always use primer and a beauty blender and good at disguising any skin issues, but there was just nothing I could do to help this out. It just looks bad and in addition has poor coverage. On top of all of that, it doesn&#x27;t last at all. I have pretty dry skin so outside of summer I don&#x27;t tend to have problems with makeup lasting, but this made it maybe 3 hours. Maybe. Then it was just gone with a couple cakey little creases left to remind me I&#x27;d applied it. This is a definite skip for me! The Maybelline Dream Wonder Fluid-Touch Foundation worked a LOT better for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. However, it came halfway full because it spilled in transit :( Still, it&#x27;s a great beauty product.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle has some drawbacks, when i received the product, it has leaked out.</li>
            <li> Perfect lightweight coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. This color matches my complexion perfectly. Product arrived 3 days earlier than estimate - am very happy with my purchase!</li>
