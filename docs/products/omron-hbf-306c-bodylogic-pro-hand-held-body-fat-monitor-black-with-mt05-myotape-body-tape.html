            <li>I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing fault for the price we paid, simply a great addition to our suite of health monitoring devices.</li>
            <li>There is a great disparity between my recordable score and the reading that I get from this device.</li>

            <li>The Omron body fat analyzer is amazing!</li>
            <li>This machine is going to be the encouragement to continue fighting the good fight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started lifting weights but needed a good way to see if I were gaining muscle of fat.  </li>
            <li>So I started just taking 3 measurements and averaging the measurements thinking this would be good</li>
            <li>Good for some one who lives alone.</li>
            <li>The tape measure add on is good for measuring some type of body fat metric in obese clients or for measuring gains in muscles size in clients with a bodybuilding goal.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading a lot of good reviews about the product.</li>
            <li>But, all things considered, at this price point, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>

            <li>Got this handy dandy machine today.  </li>
            <li>Used this with my co-worker to track their fat loss works nicely.  </li>
            <li>The tape is nice too.</li>
            <li>but I feel a difference in my strength and size, and this is a handy way of scientifically verifying that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bear to pay thousands of dollars for his PT training so decided to do it myself, including measuring / monitoring my own body fat, weight, dimensions, dieting and exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My clients loved that they were able to see their BMI and body fat.</li>
            <li>Tape measure is a good companion and makes it easy to use without assistance from someone else.</li>
            <li>The hand held body fat monitor is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wish it could tell you more information , but still nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the monitor isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, but it&#x27;s good to see progress.</li>
            <li>This Fat Monitor is very accurate, and helps me measure my body fat whenever I feel like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it is very accurate.</li>
            <li>gresat product, very accurate</li>
            <li>Seems very accurate to me.</li>
            <li>Very accurate for a handheld device.  </li>
            <li>With a very fit client with about 10% body fat it doesn&#x27;t register correctly.</li>
            <li>The screen is nice and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Love this device.</li>
            <li>This device helps my wife and me have a better idea of how we are doing in controlling our body fat.</li>
            <li>I use it also once a month and love how it hooks.</li>
            <li>This device works better than the body fat analyzer scales.</li>
            <li>and you get stronger :)</li>
            <li>I love this item, and I&#x27; am please with this seller.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I really love the memory location hence I don&#x27;t have to keep writing my input all the time.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so this is much better than a scale in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was able to navigate through this</li>
            <li>The Omron, is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>This was an impulse/indulgence sort of purchase -- I could have used the money to buy something much more worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>to get a more personalized reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Together they help you make the most of your fitness training.</li>
            <li>Quality product, better than a scale to measure progress towards weight loss goals, plus the measuring tape also helps too.</li>
            <li>Worked good at first but then started freezing up on me</li>
            <li>I realy love the measurement device it so easy to use</li>
            <li>tape measure is pretty cool, great for measuring by yourself.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have great expectation for such an inexpensive machine, but this body composition monitor is more accurate than the $2,500 model they have ay my gym.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the reading is more accurate for couch potatoes.</li>
            <li>This is MUCH more accurate.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t that accurate-this is more accurate and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The setup is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, convenient to have in home.</li>
            <li>I do like the measuring tape, also easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this machine in my fitness business works well easy to use and portable</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and set up.</li>
            <li>Easy to work and comes with batteries.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and provides the information in seconds.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and program.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up easy to use.</li>
            <li>Healthy way to stay on the right track!</li>
            <li>This may be good for normal weight people, but not heavyweight athlete,</li>
            <li>Pretty nice device, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and appears to be accurate.</li>
            <li>but afterwords you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>HBF-306C is accurate.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning and the reading feels accurate.</li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT WRK ACCURATELY</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews about it not being accurate</li>
            <li>Appears to be as accurate as the versions used in my gym.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s accurate otherwise.</li>
            <li>This product is not even close to accurate.</li>
            <li>Whether this is accurate is not as important as whether it shows a change.  </li>
            <li>In my quest to stay fit, both of these items are used often.</li>
            <li>I had a free training session with a trainer and they used the Omron to measure my body fat percentage.</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use, great tool to have at hand if you are into fitness and nutrition education.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m happy with the Omron monitor.</li>
            <li>This device is great for having around the house or for personal trainers.</li>
            <li>It can be more useful than just tracking weight.</li>
            <li>so comes in handy thanks again</li>
            <li>My clients enjoy checking in before they get in the FIT Bodywrap.</li>
            <li>Very useful product.</li>
            <li>Very useful equipment to track fitness progress.</li>
            <li>Very accurate and consistent measures.</li>
            <li>Read the directions, you have to take the test first thing in the morning, or more than 2 hours after you eat, and hand placement and arm position can affect the reading, so</li>
            <li>just be consistent with the way you do it each time and youll be able to see your progress.</li>
            <li>We think it&#x27;s ok to allow for this because having the ability to measure our body fats conveniently and consistently help us in our weight management</li>
            <li>I originally bought this one specifically because I saw a really dedicated fitness girl using it, and she raved about how much she loved it.</li>
            <li>More importantly, this items tracks how much you lose, and can compare your results with friends, family, or even co workers.</li>
            <li>This is the same type body fat monitor that my nutritionist has and I love that I can track my body fat on my own at home.  </li>
            <li>and I figure if it&#x27;s good enough for them</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>This would have gotten the full 5 stars, but the measurement tape that was pictured</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, ready right out of the box .</li>
            <li>The item is easy to use, works well, and provides consistent readings.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and getting it set up really is a breeze!</li>
            <li>The instructions say to have the top of your palm and bottom of your palm cover the metal parts, middle finger around the grip and thumbs up on top.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>so you can quickly test your and family without having to re-key in all your data each time.</li>
            <li>Fairly accurate... gives fairly consistent readings.</li>
            <li>I think that means its pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>Very consistent results when you use per instructions.</li>
            <li>This has been super useful for tracking fat loss, and keeping me motivated even when the number on the scale isnt changing.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I have given it many tries, I follow the instructions and it´s not close to accurate reading of my fat mass!  </li>
            <li>This device has really helped me to gage my fat burn accurately without a scale.</li>
            <li>Delivery was okay, but this product is just clear cut making fool of peoples.</li>
            <li>it is Worth the $</li>
            <li>Being able to measure my body fat % and accurately measure different parts of my body has been very helpful!</li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT WORK RIGHT.</li>
            <li>I even checked the accuracy with calipers and it was right on the money.  </li>
            <li>The knob falls right out of the slot.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the general public...</li>
            <li>This Omron unit, an older Tanita scale and a cheap Taylor scale.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use after reading very clear instructions.  </li>
            <li>I did not get my grip right at first, but then it worked well.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at how quickly the tape and body fat monitor came in.</li>
            <li>I very much like to use this instead of the caliper device or scales that have body fat function.</li>
            <li>With the Omron reader my body fat percentage and other measurements are more accurate.</li>
            <li>When they read lower, it reads higher, when they read higher, it reads lower.  </li>
            <li>You can look for overall trends across many weeks of tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use this device to track changes and then confirm with a better method such as Dexa every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I used this first thing every morning so that the readings would be consistent.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>About 4 months ago, I joined the gym and was interested in losing about 15 pounds.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing a body fat monitor.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what the description said and was delivered by date I chose.</li>
            <li>those interested in losing body fat and monitoring their progress.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the readings, it only varies 1-2% or 2 lbs.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy more in future.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t realize when i ordered that i was going to get a skin caliper, but sure enough one came with it.</li>
            <li>This proudct was exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li>it is well-made, and exactly as presented...</li>
            <li>-so you have to be consistent in how you measure.</li>
            <li>The morning reading never varied more than 1/2 of a percent from one day to the next, as did the afternoon.</li>
            <li>The biggest variance was-the morning one tended to be 1 percentage point lower than the afternoon one-but again consistently.  </li>
            <li>the intention for this at this price isn&#x27;&#x27;t exact clinical accuracy anyway.</li>
            <li>I checked body fat with the caliper first and then the monitor.</li>
            <li>The results were exactly the</li>
            <li>It is consistent with the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>know this because I have another bioscanner at work and am aware that I&#x27;m not close to being 12% but closer to 17-18%</li>
            <li>I believe this monitor is much more accurate than a much more expensive stand-on BMI scale I have because this one is very consistent where as the scale one fluctuates a lot.</li>
            <li>Get a  more measurable goal such as A certain waist size, Squat weight of 1.5 or 2 times your body weight.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use the body fat monitor immediately on a few clients and it seemed to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>normal average women is very accurate and precise.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE SCALE WHICH IS TEMPERAMENTAL  AND NOT EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>a while ago it came pretty close to my Tanita scale 2 hours after waking up, at that time i didn&#x27;t have the Omron but the device is very close to Tanita at 2 hours after waking up.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed a lot more tone and less fat, and am starting to see the division between the top 2 &amp;#34;cans&amp;#34; of my 6 pack.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly accurate and produces similar results every time it is used.</li>
            <li>The Omron is accurate and simply to use.</li>
            <li>body fat monitor is as accurate as possible for a hand held&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for a home device.</li>
            <li>Some of the results are as much as 1% difference.</li>
            <li>And this product really helps me to monitor my body fat loss.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would suggest getting a name brand advanced scale for $50 - $80 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your trying to lose fat, you absolutely have to track your progress.  </li>
            <li>You really just want to track change, which they all do.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and as described online.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT GAVE VERY INCORRECT RESULTS.</li>
            <li>But, I will say that I really like the tape measure.</li>
            <li>These two items work very well in measuring body fat</li>
            <li>Stand really still</li>
            <li>Knowing my body fat percentage is really a downer.  </li>
            <li>it´s very motivating to see how body fat percentage get lowers with time.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I returned it and got a Tanita Iron Man scale, which works very well.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re really into measuring, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li>I measured 2x&#x27;s a day for 5 days straight-</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been really helpful in keeping me on track with my fitness goals.</li>
            <li>And then checking it after to see how much fat they can burn.</li>
            <li>I had to bulk it up with duct tape to make the fit snug enough so it would stay in place.</li>
            <li>However, it is very useful for measuring daily or weekly changes to determine if progress is being made.  </li>
            <li>Seems ok but not exactly what I thought it was going to do</li>
            <li>instruction are pretty clear on when you should and should not use this device.  </li>
            <li>I started out seeing 10-11mm 2 months ago which roughly equates to 18% body fat (I only use 1 measurement but it takes 4 to me real accurate.  </li>
            <li>The two were withing one half percent of one another, so I feel confident that the Omron</li>
            <li>Super simple to get going with personalized Profiles.  </li>
            <li>I am not only interested in losing weight, I am interested in losing body fat.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, it did give me 3 different</li>
            <li>it is self explanatory, unlike many others which are much more complicated</li>
            <li>I would recommend to not obsess over these numbers, measure &amp; record yourself once a week and find a training program (highly recommend a strength program) and count your calories using myfitnesspal app to keep yourself at a 200 - 300 caloric deficit a day.</li>
            <li>It seems that this device warrants more fine-tuning for individuals with little body fat.  </li>
            <li>and I figured since it&#x27;s so cheap that this would be expected.</li>
            <li>aware all these devices really depend on your hydration levels, so track daily.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a cheat sheet normal range card</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very portable which was important because in my previous job I traveled full-time.</li>
            <li>With these tools, I feel like I FINALLY have the right information for my weight loss and weight training to follow.  </li>
            <li>There is a guest setting on it so you can enter new information into it without losing your personal/family settings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Most of the time, the total fat % is too high when I compare it with other techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I am built more solid, weight loss has always been a rough go for me.  </li>
            <li>Use it at the same time of day and keep hydration levels consistent through the week.  </li>
            <li>I use the exact same one at the gym I work at</li>
            <li>but it gives consistent results when testing multiple times in succession.</li>
            <li>This unit has not been reliable for me or a friend who owns the exact same unit.  </li>
            <li>I was excited (maybe hopeful) to get this item due to the reviews.</li>
            <li>Readings taken a few days apart can easily vary by 2 or 3%.</li>
            <li>As an active Ironman and endurance sport participant I highly recommend it as a  useful home tool for body composition management.</li>
            <li>The first time I came across this body fat device is at my local gym, where a PT (personal trainer) will measure this for me and all other important metrics so that he can sell me his services.</li>
            <li>I still use it once a month just to get an idea of how I&#x27;m doing as far as fat loss.</li>
            <li>Also, there is very substantial difference between readings taken on different days, even if I try to control the time of day.</li>
            <li>The tape measure is a waste of time, no wonder it is a free add-on.</li>
            <li>However, note that there are a lot of variables; time of day you takr the measurements, amount of water you drank, how far out you extend your arms....</li>
            <li>I found that the measurements were wildly inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to accept losing only 2 pounds, when I know that I have lost 4 pounds of fat and gained 2 pounds of muscle.  </li>
            <li>I was aware of the bad and the good</li>
            <li>tape measure is simply but decent quality</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the vast difference in readings between the settings normal and athletic.</li>
            <li>It is a quick test that I can do with new clients to get a baseline measurement and then take it back to them in a few weeks to get another measurement.</li>
            <li>Readings taken within a few minutes of each other are fairly stable, usually within 0.5% of each other, but they are not as accurate as 0.1%, which one might be led to believe from the display that moves in increments of 0.1%.</li>
            <li>Measurements generally match my Tanita scale within 2 percent.</li>
            <li>It may have been designed for the masses in general body fat ranges.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No where near actual body fat percentage if you are heavyweight.</li>
            <li>Very similar to professional results.</li>
            <li>and I would say I am right on the edge of the bottom 2 showing their stubborn little faces.  </li>
            <li>Nobody wants to hear the endless clicks as you extend the tape for measurement.</li>
            <li>so you can see if your data is low / normal / high if you are not familiar with the metrics.</li>
            <li>but I can use it back to back to back and get all different results as far as body fat.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for using this to monitor my body fat loss this year, but I can get up to a 4% variation from one reading to the next, even one after the other.</li>

            <li> item in great shape.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great price for all that is included.</li>
            <li> The monitor works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing fault for the price we paid, simply a great addition to our suite of health monitoring devices.</li>
            <li> There is a great disparity between my recordable score and the reading that I get from this device.</li>

            <li> The Omron body fat analyzer is amazing!</li>
            <li> This machine is going to be the encouragement to continue fighting the good fight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started lifting weights but needed a good way to see if I were gaining muscle of fat.  </li>
            <li> So I started just taking 3 measurements and averaging the measurements thinking this would be good</li>
            <li> Good for some one who lives alone.</li>
            <li> The tape measure add on is good for measuring some type of body fat metric in obese clients or for measuring gains in muscles size in clients with a bodybuilding goal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a lot of good reviews about the product.</li>
            <li> But, all things considered, at this price point, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>

            <li> Got this handy dandy machine today.  </li>
            <li> Used this with my co-worker to track their fat loss works nicely.  </li>
            <li> The tape is nice too.</li>
            <li> but I feel a difference in my strength and size, and this is a handy way of scientifically verifying that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bear to pay thousands of dollars for his PT training so decided to do it myself, including measuring / monitoring my own body fat, weight, dimensions, dieting and exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My clients loved that they were able to see their BMI and body fat.</li>
            <li> Tape measure is a good companion and makes it easy to use without assistance from someone else.</li>
            <li> The hand held body fat monitor is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wish it could tell you more information , but still nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the monitor isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, but it&#x27;s good to see progress.</li>
            <li> This Fat Monitor is very accurate, and helps me measure my body fat whenever I feel like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it is very accurate.</li>
            <li> gresat product, very accurate</li>
            <li> Seems very accurate to me.</li>
            <li> Very accurate for a handheld device.  </li>
            <li> With a very fit client with about 10% body fat it doesn&#x27;t register correctly.</li>
            <li> The screen is nice and easy to read.</li>
            <li> Love this device.</li>
            <li> This device helps my wife and me have a better idea of how we are doing in controlling our body fat.</li>
            <li> I use it also once a month and love how it hooks.</li>
            <li> This device works better than the body fat analyzer scales.</li>
            <li> and you get stronger :)</li>
            <li> I love this item, and I&#x27; am please with this seller.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I really love the memory location hence I don&#x27;t have to keep writing my input all the time.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> so this is much better than a scale in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was able to navigate through this</li>
            <li> The Omron, is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> This was an impulse/indulgence sort of purchase -- I could have used the money to buy something much more worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> to get a more personalized reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Together they help you make the most of your fitness training.</li>
            <li> Quality product, better than a scale to measure progress towards weight loss goals, plus the measuring tape also helps too.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first but then started freezing up on me</li>
            <li> I realy love the measurement device it so easy to use</li>
            <li> tape measure is pretty cool, great for measuring by yourself.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have great expectation for such an inexpensive machine, but this body composition monitor is more accurate than the $2,500 model they have ay my gym.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the reading is more accurate for couch potatoes.</li>
            <li> This is MUCH more accurate.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t that accurate-this is more accurate and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The setup is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient to have in home.</li>
            <li> I do like the measuring tape, also easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this machine in my fitness business works well easy to use and portable</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and set up.</li>
            <li> Easy to work and comes with batteries.  </li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and provides the information in seconds.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and program.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up easy to use.</li>
            <li> Healthy way to stay on the right track!</li>
            <li> This may be good for normal weight people, but not heavyweight athlete,</li>
            <li> Pretty nice device, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and appears to be accurate.</li>
            <li> but afterwords you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> HBF-306C is accurate.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning and the reading feels accurate.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WRK ACCURATELY</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews about it not being accurate</li>
            <li> Appears to be as accurate as the versions used in my gym.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s accurate otherwise.</li>
            <li> This product is not even close to accurate.</li>
            <li> Whether this is accurate is not as important as whether it shows a change.  </li>
            <li> In my quest to stay fit, both of these items are used often.</li>
            <li> I had a free training session with a trainer and they used the Omron to measure my body fat percentage.</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use, great tool to have at hand if you are into fitness and nutrition education.</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m happy with the Omron monitor.</li>
            <li> This device is great for having around the house or for personal trainers.</li>
            <li> It can be more useful than just tracking weight.</li>
            <li> so comes in handy thanks again</li>
            <li> My clients enjoy checking in before they get in the FIT Bodywrap.</li>
            <li> Very useful product.</li>
            <li> Very useful equipment to track fitness progress.</li>
            <li> Very accurate and consistent measures.</li>
            <li> Read the directions, you have to take the test first thing in the morning, or more than 2 hours after you eat, and hand placement and arm position can affect the reading, so</li>
            <li> just be consistent with the way you do it each time and youll be able to see your progress.</li>
            <li> We think it&#x27;s ok to allow for this because having the ability to measure our body fats conveniently and consistently help us in our weight management</li>
            <li> I originally bought this one specifically because I saw a really dedicated fitness girl using it, and she raved about how much she loved it.</li>
            <li> More importantly, this items tracks how much you lose, and can compare your results with friends, family, or even co workers.</li>
            <li> This is the same type body fat monitor that my nutritionist has and I love that I can track my body fat on my own at home.  </li>
            <li> and I figure if it&#x27;s good enough for them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> This would have gotten the full 5 stars, but the measurement tape that was pictured</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, ready right out of the box .</li>
            <li> The item is easy to use, works well, and provides consistent readings.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and getting it set up really is a breeze!</li>
            <li> The instructions say to have the top of your palm and bottom of your palm cover the metal parts, middle finger around the grip and thumbs up on top.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> so you can quickly test your and family without having to re-key in all your data each time.</li>
            <li> Fairly accurate... gives fairly consistent readings.</li>
            <li> I think that means its pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Very consistent results when you use per instructions.</li>
            <li> This has been super useful for tracking fat loss, and keeping me motivated even when the number on the scale isnt changing.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have given it many tries, I follow the instructions and it´s not close to accurate reading of my fat mass!  </li>
            <li> This device has really helped me to gage my fat burn accurately without a scale.</li>
            <li> Delivery was okay, but this product is just clear cut making fool of peoples.</li>
            <li> it is Worth the $</li>
            <li> Being able to measure my body fat % and accurately measure different parts of my body has been very helpful!</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WORK RIGHT.</li>
            <li> I even checked the accuracy with calipers and it was right on the money.  </li>
            <li> The knob falls right out of the slot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the general public...</li>
            <li> This Omron unit, an older Tanita scale and a cheap Taylor scale.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use after reading very clear instructions.  </li>
            <li> I did not get my grip right at first, but then it worked well.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how quickly the tape and body fat monitor came in.</li>
            <li> I very much like to use this instead of the caliper device or scales that have body fat function.</li>
            <li> With the Omron reader my body fat percentage and other measurements are more accurate.</li>
            <li> When they read lower, it reads higher, when they read higher, it reads lower.  </li>
            <li> You can look for overall trends across many weeks of tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use this device to track changes and then confirm with a better method such as Dexa every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used this first thing every morning so that the readings would be consistent.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> About 4 months ago, I joined the gym and was interested in losing about 15 pounds.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a body fat monitor.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what the description said and was delivered by date I chose.</li>
            <li> those interested in losing body fat and monitoring their progress.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the readings, it only varies 1-2% or 2 lbs.</li>
            <li> I would probably buy more in future.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t realize when i ordered that i was going to get a skin caliper, but sure enough one came with it.</li>
            <li> This proudct was exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li> it is well-made, and exactly as presented...</li>
            <li> -so you have to be consistent in how you measure.</li>
            <li> The morning reading never varied more than 1/2 of a percent from one day to the next, as did the afternoon.</li>
            <li> The biggest variance was-the morning one tended to be 1 percentage point lower than the afternoon one-but again consistently.  </li>
            <li> the intention for this at this price isn&#x27;&#x27;t exact clinical accuracy anyway.</li>
            <li> I checked body fat with the caliper first and then the monitor.</li>
            <li> The results were exactly the</li>
            <li> It is consistent with the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> know this because I have another bioscanner at work and am aware that I&#x27;m not close to being 12% but closer to 17-18%</li>
            <li> I believe this monitor is much more accurate than a much more expensive stand-on BMI scale I have because this one is very consistent where as the scale one fluctuates a lot.</li>
            <li> Get a  more measurable goal such as A certain waist size, Squat weight of 1.5 or 2 times your body weight.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use the body fat monitor immediately on a few clients and it seemed to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> normal average women is very accurate and precise.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE SCALE WHICH IS TEMPERAMENTAL  AND NOT EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li> a while ago it came pretty close to my Tanita scale 2 hours after waking up, at that time i didn&#x27;t have the Omron but the device is very close to Tanita at 2 hours after waking up.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed a lot more tone and less fat, and am starting to see the division between the top 2 &amp;#34;cans&amp;#34; of my 6 pack.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly accurate and produces similar results every time it is used.</li>
            <li> The Omron is accurate and simply to use.</li>
            <li> body fat monitor is as accurate as possible for a hand held&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for a home device.</li>
            <li> Some of the results are as much as 1% difference.</li>
            <li> And this product really helps me to monitor my body fat loss.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would suggest getting a name brand advanced scale for $50 - $80 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your trying to lose fat, you absolutely have to track your progress.  </li>
            <li> You really just want to track change, which they all do.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and as described online.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT GAVE VERY INCORRECT RESULTS.</li>
            <li> But, I will say that I really like the tape measure.</li>
            <li> These two items work very well in measuring body fat</li>
            <li> Stand really still</li>
            <li> Knowing my body fat percentage is really a downer.  </li>
            <li> it´s very motivating to see how body fat percentage get lowers with time.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I returned it and got a Tanita Iron Man scale, which works very well.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re really into measuring, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> I measured 2x&#x27;s a day for 5 days straight-</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been really helpful in keeping me on track with my fitness goals.</li>
            <li> And then checking it after to see how much fat they can burn.</li>
            <li> I had to bulk it up with duct tape to make the fit snug enough so it would stay in place.</li>
            <li> However, it is very useful for measuring daily or weekly changes to determine if progress is being made.  </li>
            <li> Seems ok but not exactly what I thought it was going to do</li>
            <li> instruction are pretty clear on when you should and should not use this device.  </li>
            <li> I started out seeing 10-11mm 2 months ago which roughly equates to 18% body fat (I only use 1 measurement but it takes 4 to me real accurate.  </li>
            <li> The two were withing one half percent of one another, so I feel confident that the Omron</li>
            <li> Super simple to get going with personalized Profiles.  </li>
            <li> I am not only interested in losing weight, I am interested in losing body fat.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, it did give me 3 different</li>
            <li> it is self explanatory, unlike many others which are much more complicated</li>
            <li> I would recommend to not obsess over these numbers, measure &amp; record yourself once a week and find a training program (highly recommend a strength program) and count your calories using myfitnesspal app to keep yourself at a 200 - 300 caloric deficit a day.</li>
            <li> It seems that this device warrants more fine-tuning for individuals with little body fat.  </li>
            <li> and I figured since it&#x27;s so cheap that this would be expected.</li>
            <li> aware all these devices really depend on your hydration levels, so track daily.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a cheat sheet normal range card</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very portable which was important because in my previous job I traveled full-time.</li>
            <li> With these tools, I feel like I FINALLY have the right information for my weight loss and weight training to follow.  </li>
            <li> There is a guest setting on it so you can enter new information into it without losing your personal/family settings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Most of the time, the total fat % is too high when I compare it with other techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I am built more solid, weight loss has always been a rough go for me.  </li>
            <li> Use it at the same time of day and keep hydration levels consistent through the week.  </li>
            <li> I use the exact same one at the gym I work at</li>
            <li> but it gives consistent results when testing multiple times in succession.</li>
            <li> This unit has not been reliable for me or a friend who owns the exact same unit.  </li>
            <li> I was excited (maybe hopeful) to get this item due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Readings taken a few days apart can easily vary by 2 or 3%.</li>
            <li> As an active Ironman and endurance sport participant I highly recommend it as a  useful home tool for body composition management.</li>
            <li> The first time I came across this body fat device is at my local gym, where a PT (personal trainer) will measure this for me and all other important metrics so that he can sell me his services.</li>
            <li> I still use it once a month just to get an idea of how I&#x27;m doing as far as fat loss.</li>
            <li> Also, there is very substantial difference between readings taken on different days, even if I try to control the time of day.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is a waste of time, no wonder it is a free add-on.</li>
            <li> However, note that there are a lot of variables; time of day you takr the measurements, amount of water you drank, how far out you extend your arms....</li>
            <li> I found that the measurements were wildly inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to accept losing only 2 pounds, when I know that I have lost 4 pounds of fat and gained 2 pounds of muscle.  </li>
            <li> I was aware of the bad and the good</li>
            <li> tape measure is simply but decent quality</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the vast difference in readings between the settings normal and athletic.</li>
            <li> It is a quick test that I can do with new clients to get a baseline measurement and then take it back to them in a few weeks to get another measurement.</li>
            <li> Readings taken within a few minutes of each other are fairly stable, usually within 0.5% of each other, but they are not as accurate as 0.1%, which one might be led to believe from the display that moves in increments of 0.1%.</li>
            <li> Measurements generally match my Tanita scale within 2 percent.</li>
            <li> It may have been designed for the masses in general body fat ranges.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No where near actual body fat percentage if you are heavyweight.</li>
            <li> Very similar to professional results.</li>
            <li> and I would say I am right on the edge of the bottom 2 showing their stubborn little faces.  </li>
            <li> Nobody wants to hear the endless clicks as you extend the tape for measurement.</li>
            <li> so you can see if your data is low / normal / high if you are not familiar with the metrics.</li>
            <li> but I can use it back to back to back and get all different results as far as body fat.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for using this to monitor my body fat loss this year, but I can get up to a 4% variation from one reading to the next, even one after the other.</li>
            <li> I have compared it with other body fat monitors and the results are far different!  </li>
            <li> Even if you move one hand slightly, it&#x27;ll give you a new %.</li>
            <li> This may be a problem in general with this method of measurement (that depends on hydration levels and possibly other factors related to skin impedance), and not necessarily a flaw of the device.</li>
            <li> If I work out hard for a week straight, my percentage steadily goes down.</li>
            <li> If I test my percentage three times in a row, my results are the same, no wild fluctuations.</li>
            <li> In addition the hand held body tape started at 2 1/4\\&quot; instead of at 0\\&quot; which made things difficult to get an accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described, would recommend to others for future purchase, purchased due to competitive rates and condition of item.</li>
            <li> 2 months later it is down to 3 mm which equates to about 10-11% body fat.  </li>
            <li> I would probably buy it again but the tape that came with it ripped in half (width-wise just by the end) on retracting the third time I used it</li>
            <li> The only issue is I wished it would keep track/log of previous measurements.</li>
            <li> Received from shipper as expected</li>
            <li> and I am not very machine coordinate.</li>
            <li> Tells your body fat % and BMI and gets you motivated to hit the gym harder and harder.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advice of a couple of other people and used it at the same time everyday, and it still varied by 6-12% each time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this unit about 30 days as a backup for other devices.  </li>
            <li> The Omron seems to disagree with the other two units.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it will read 26% and other times it will still read 29-30%.</li>
            <li> read other reviews</li>
            <li> Because body fat doesn&#x27;t change a lot from day to day, inconsistent readings make this monitor pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> For the tape measure, just be careful and hold the button down as you pull the tape out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the tape, I started using this device for a little while, but it never really gave me any additional motivation.</li>
            <li> The Omron seems to function for that, while at times seeming to be less reliable than the other two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> users complained that if they stood there and measured three times it would give them 3 different readings and I tried this.</li>
            <li> The readings fluctuate so much that the product is really useless to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, so I&#x27;m not out much really  </li>
            <li> : The measurements (BF %) is OFF by at least 5% for &amp;#34;athletic&amp;#34; builds and maybe another 3% for regular builds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the readings are slightly off.</li>
            <li> The Fat Monitor was a little awkward to use the first time.</li>
            <li> product has a listing on Amazon for a few dollars less if you do not want the tap measure add on.</li>
            <li> I had a little confusion with the instructions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> but it was just a foolish waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than 40 dollars and it works if used as directed, it isn&#x27;t an expensive medical device meant for use by elite athletic teams and trainers.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong, I&#x27;ve tested myself a few times throughout the day and my fat percentage only waivered about 1%.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> It gets no better than that.</li>
            <li> Its not accurate!</li>
            <li> I base that statement on measuring with several different devices of varying cost and quality.</li>
            <li> After being shocked at how high it was, I wanted to buy the Omron for home use so that I could track my bodyfat percentage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is widely said that 10% is the mark of the infamous six pack</li>
            <li> I follow what it says-at least 2 hours after eating or drinking anything substantial.</li>
            <li> It does the job, although slowly.  </li>
            <li> Trying to program it to US was a little difficult</li>
            <li> I usually measure by calipers, but wanted this option for my shy clients.</li>
            <li> Still, the display up to a tenth of a percent can give a false sense of accuracy.</li>
            <li> 1% usually on any given day... which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT GIVES TERRIBLY WRONG READINGS.  </li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because the hotel address was wrong and they return my money immediately.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product itself...</li>
            <li> so you know how to use it and how it can give false readings!</li>
            <li> She did not steer me wrong!</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I just get a bad scanner?</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll get frustrated like I did.</li>
            <li> I hate the BMI measurements, because I work with police officers who are in no way, shape, or form overweight, but because of their muscle mass.  </li>
            <li> The BF analyzer is honestly terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just like the one at my Dr office.</li>
            <li> great if you wanna control your progress on a diet</li>
            <li> Love this device. Very accurate and consistent measures.</li>
            <li> I use this every Friday to watch my bodyfat percentage. I wanted to use the same way to measure each week to watch my progress.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the tape, I started using this device for a little while, but it never really gave me any additional motivation. I still prefer the scale.</li>
            <li> This device helps my wife and me have a better idea of how we are doing in controlling our body fat. It is fairly accurate and produces similar results every time it is used. Reasonable price for a home device.</li>
            <li> This item feels very solid in your hands but if there is any moisture (sweat, post shower, etc.) the readings are slightly off. I would probably buy it again but the tape that came with it ripped in half (width-wise just by the end) on retracting the third time I used it so I was pretty disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> not what I thought  it would do but will use it</li>
            <li> This works just like it is supposed to!  The best feature is that it will hold memory for up to 8 people /patients, so when you are retesting, you do not have to re-enter height, weight, gender, etc. on each person, because it saves those values. That being said, you SHOULD change any values that are different, such as weight, because that will affect your output values. Very handy for people on an exercise and/or diet program to keep track of their progress.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received from shipper as expected</li>
            <li> I bought botht he Body Fat Monitor and a pair of traditional calipers for measuring body fat.  The two were withing one half percent of one another, so I feel confident that the Omron HBF-306C is accurate.  Read the directions, you have to take the test first thing in the morning, or more than 2 hours after you eat, and hand placement and arm position can affect the reading, so repeat readings need to be taken in the same position.</li>
            <li> I want to believe this works but I can use it back to back to back and get all different results as far as body fat. Some of the results are as much as 1% difference. I still use it once a month just to get an idea of how I&#x27;m doing as far as fat loss. The measuring tape is awesome! I use it also once a month and love how it hooks.</li>
            <li> This is well-designed and ergonomic. The setup is easy. I did not get my grip right at first, but then it worked well. Readings taken within a few minutes of each other are fairly stable, usually within 0.5% of each other, but they are not as accurate as 0.1%, which one might be led to believe from the display that moves in increments of 0.1%. Also, there is very substantial difference between readings taken on different days, even if I try to control the time of day. Readings taken a few days apart can easily vary by 2 or 3%. This may be a problem in general with this method of measurement (that depends on hydration levels and possibly other factors related to skin impedance), and not necessarily a flaw of the device. Still, the display up to a tenth of a percent can give a false sense of accuracy. Measurements generally match my Tanita scale within 2 percent.</li>
            <li> I bought thisbproduct with a goal in mind and it met my goals 100%. This product was everything that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This device works better than the body fat analyzer scales.</li>
            <li> i dont if it works well or not. i hope it does, it says i was losing wieght</li>
            <li> Got this handy dandy machine today.  Bonus: It came with batteries.  Super simple to get going with personalized Profiles.  I saw reviews saying that it was inaccurate from one measurement to the next.  I took 3 measurements back to back - 11.10%, 10.90 %, and 11%.  Though they were different I think that is close enough for country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is widely said that 10% is the mark of the infamous six pack and I would say I am right on the edge of the bottom 2 showing their stubborn little faces.  This machine is going to be the encouragement to continue fighting the good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction are pretty clear on when you should and should not use this device.  If it helps - I took my measurements about an hour after I ate lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Extra info to those trying to lose Fat (Notice I did not say weight):  Devices such as this and scales can be highly addictive to check and fret on if the numbers are not cooperating.  I would recommend to not obsess over these numbers, measure &amp; record yourself once a week and find a training program (highly recommend a strength program) and count your calories using myfitnesspal app to keep yourself at a 200 - 300 caloric deficit a day. Stick to these two things and just like math; the numbers will work out and your body will adjust accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight is a misleading number and should be taken with a grain of salt &amp; a shrug.  Get a  more measurable goal such as A certain waist size, Squat weight of 1.5 or 2 times your body weight.  (the great thing about this is the goal gets closer as your weight drops and you get stronger :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency &amp; Time - You got this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra tips:  Barbell training &amp; Intermittent fasting</li>
            <li> Fairly accurate... gives fairly consistent readings. +/- 1% usually on any given day... which isn&#x27;t bad. I usually measure by calipers, but wanted this option for my shy clients.</li>
            <li> i bought these to track changes in diet and weight loss. i&#x27;ve been using the tape measure and using the US Navy&#x27;s body fat calculator. the tape measure calculation gets to a lower body fat percentage versus what the omron device shows, but both are tracking the same directionally.</li>
            <li> The hand held body fat monitor is very easy to use.  I am not only interested in losing weight, I am interested in losing body fat.  And this product really helps me to monitor my body fat loss.</li>
            <li> I love this item, and I&#x27; am please with this seller. This Fat Monitor is very accurate, and helps me measure my body fat whenever I feel like it. I would recommend this item, because losing body fat should be everyone&#x27;s GOAL. More importantly, this items tracks how much you lose, and can compare your results with friends, family, or even co workers. It gets no better than that.</li>
            <li> Used this with my co-worker to track their fat loss works nicely.  A good bye and tape is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong, I&#x27;ve tested myself a few times throughout the day and my fat percentage only waivered about 1%. I think that means its pretty accurate. The tape is nice too. It&#x27;s longer than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Delivery was okay, but this product is just clear cut making fool of peoples. No where near actual body fat percentage if you are heavyweight. This may be good for normal weight people, but not heavyweight athlete,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now. It works perfectly and seeing your body fat dropping encourages you to keep on working out. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient to have in home. Another reviewer posted it came with calipers. The description didn&#x27;t say so, and my package did not. I do like the measuring tape, also easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the vast difference in readings between the settings normal and athletic. Over 10% body fat difference for my lean and toned son, without an explanation as to why. He works out daily, but he isn&#x27;t an Olympic athlete. So although he fits the guideline for athlete, it leaves him questioning the results from the machine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this unit about 30 days as a backup for other devices.  Overall, I would suggest getting a name brand advanced scale for $50 - $80 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your trying to lose fat, you absolutely have to track your progress.  You have to know if it is weight, water, fat or muscle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use three devices.  This Omron unit, an older Tanita scale and a cheap Taylor scale.  The Omron seems to disagree with the other two units.  When they read lower, it reads higher, when they read higher, it reads lower.  Obviously, different products yield different percentages.  You really just want to track change, which they all do.  The Omron seems to function for that, while at times seeming to be less reliable than the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware all these devices really depend on your hydration levels, so track daily.  Use it at the same time of day and keep hydration levels consistent through the week.  You can look for overall trends across many weeks of tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should begin with a formal Bod Pod measurement, water weighing, or the best... Dexa scanning.  Use this device to track changes and then confirm with a better method such as Dexa every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have great expectation for such an inexpensive machine, but this body composition monitor is more accurate than the $2,500 model they have ay my gym.  I base that statement on measuring with several different devices of varying cost and quality.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Healthy way to stay on the right track! I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying gain muscle.</li>
            <li> I use this machine in my fitness business works well easy to use and portable</li>
            <li> This product seems to work great. I use it every morning and the reading feels accurate. If I work out hard for a week straight, my percentage steadily goes down. I also like to test myself several times in a row. If I test my percentage three times in a row, my results are the same, no wild fluctuations.</li>
            <li> Seems ok but not exactly what I thought it was going to do</li>
            <li> The Omron body fat analyzer is amazing! I use the exact same one at the gym I work at and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the monitor isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, but it&#x27;s good to see progress. And sometime regress. Keeps me on track.</li>
            <li> I like the monitor. It is easy to use.  The tape measure is a waste of time, no wonder it is a free add-on.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. The Omron is accurate and simply to use. Furthermore, I really love the memory location hence I don&#x27;t have to keep writing my input all the time.</li>
            <li> Does what it advertises. Easy to use and set up. I can&#x27;t vouch for accuracy but it gives consistent results when testing multiple times in succession. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and as described online.  Easy to work and comes with batteries.  Would recommend for those watching their diet and exercise routine</li>
            <li> The item is easy to use, works well, and provides consistent readings.  Very pleased.  It seems durable and is convenient to use.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WRK ACCURATELY AND I HAD TO RETURN IT. AMAZON HAD ME PAY THE RETURN COST, IS THIS CORRECT?&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT GAVE VERY INCORRECT RESULTS. I HAVE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE SCALE WHICH IS TEMPERAMENTAL  AND NOT EASY TO USE.  THIS PRODUCT GIVES TERRIBLY WRONG READINGS.  IT DOES NOT WORK RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Works as expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body fat monitor is as accurate as possible for a hand held&lt;br /&gt;The tape measure is simply but decent quality</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a waste of money for me.  I have used this for 4 months before writing the review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dropped 30 pounds and hit a plateau.  I started lifting weights but needed a good way to see if I were gaining muscle of fat.  Whether this is accurate is not as important as whether it shows a change.  I used this first thing every morning so that the readings would be consistent.  I have noticed that fat % goes up the day after a workout, and drops the day after a lot of walking.  But averaging between the reading has been constant (around 19.%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months of lifting weights, running, and cardio I find that I am still the same weight, and this shows that I have only lost 1/2 lb of fat.  However, I have noticed a lot more tone and less fat, and am starting to see the division between the top 2 &amp;#34;cans&amp;#34; of my 6 pack.  After 2 months of not seeing results on this monitor I purchased a fat caliper.  I started out seeing 10-11mm 2 months ago which roughly equates to 18% body fat (I only use 1 measurement but it takes 4 to me real accurate.  1 will show the change).  2 months later it is down to 3 mm which equates to about 10-11% body fat.  This makes sense considering the tone in my abs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This has a mode to use for people that work out a lot but it does not seem to work well.  Perhaps the reading is more accurate for couch potatoes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because my healthcare provider uses it to measure body fat and I figure if it&#x27;s good enough for them it&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews about it not being accurate and I figured since it&#x27;s so cheap that this would be expected. So I started just taking 3 measurements and averaging the measurements thinking this would be good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users complained that if they stood there and measured three times it would give them 3 different readings and I tried this. Sure enough, it did give me 3 different readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later noticed that I wasn&#x27;t holding it properly. The instructions say to have the top of your palm and bottom of your palm cover the metal parts, middle finger around the grip and thumbs up on top. Even if you move one hand slightly, it&#x27;ll give you a new %. If you keep your hands in the same spot and keep your arms out, then you&#x27;ll get the same reading every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the price, this product definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> In my quest to stay fit, both of these items are used often. The monitor is very simple to use, I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions and figured it out in a matter of minutes, but thats just me.</li>
            <li> Works wells. No problems. Very easy to use. It prompts you to input information about the person using it and then you hold it and it gives you a reading.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It tells me I&#x27;m fat... That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have a fat monitoring scale and it was WAY off.  This is MUCH more accurate.  I love it.  I would rather lose fat than weight anyway.. so this is much better than a scale in my opinion.</li>
            <li> my wife passed her personal training certification and i gave her this as a gift.  Easy to use and appears to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I realy love the measurement device it so easy to use and so is the body fat device. This is helping keep up with my muscle growth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use after reading very clear instructions.  Appears to be as accurate as the versions used in my gym.  Tape measure is a good companion and makes it easy to use without assistance from someone else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK! If you get 3 measurements in a row you get 3 different results with a .5% to 1.5% deviation in either direction.</li>
            <li> LOVE this device!!! So great for monitoring fat loss rather than just relying on the scale. It&#x27;s so easy to use and getting it set up really is a breeze! It can store information for several people so it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re doing a weight loss challenge with friends or family. I originally bought this one specifically because I saw a really dedicated fitness girl using it, and she raved about how much she loved it. She did not steer me wrong! And I would totally recommend this product to others. I love mine and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get another if needed to for whatever reason!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it suppose to do.  Great inspiration</li>
            <li> Monitor works great. Wish it had bluetooth to connect to the app myfitnesspal.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use. I was able to navigate through this and I am not very machine coordinate. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I very much like to use this instead of the caliper device or scales that have body fat function. With the Omron reader my body fat percentage and other measurements are more accurate.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It works great and is accurate. The only issue is I wished it would keep track/log of previous measurements.</li>
            <li> About 4 months ago, I joined the gym and was interested in losing about 15 pounds. I had a free training session with a trainer and they used the Omron to measure my body fat percentage. After being shocked at how high it was, I wanted to buy the Omron for home use so that I could track my bodyfat percentage. The Omron, is okay. I don&#x27;t feel that it is very accurate. That day when the trainer took my body fat percentage with the Omron, it was 30%. Since that day, I have lost 15 pounds. Sometimes it will read 26% and other times it will still read 29-30%. Maybe I am just skinny fat. But, I will say that I really like the tape measure. It has started to rip at the peg, but my two boys like to play with it, so I blame it on them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a body fat monitor.  Everything works like it is supposed to.  I even checked the accuracy with calipers and it was right on the money.  For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.  I actually had a radiographic body comp analysis done after getting this device and found that it was off by a couple percentage points.  However, it is very useful for measuring daily or weekly changes to determine if progress is being made.  A great alternative to a $100 DEXA body scan every week.  As an active Ironman and endurance sport participant I highly recommend it as a  useful home tool for body composition management.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for using this to monitor my body fat loss this year, but I can get up to a 4% variation from one reading to the next, even one after the other. The readings fluctuate so much that the product is really useless to me. It&#x27;s in a drawer not being used now.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice device, I like it a lot. Tells your body fat % and BMI and gets you motivated to hit the gym harder and harder.  Wish it could tell you more information , but still nice.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because the hotel address was wrong and they return my money immediately.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described, would recommend to others for future purchase, purchased due to competitive rates and condition of item.</li>
            <li> I have given it many tries, I follow the instructions and it´s not close to accurate reading of my fat mass!  Every time I use it it reads fat mass below 14% and believe me, it´s not!!!  I have compared it with other body fat monitors and the results are far different!  Does not work!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what the description said and was delivered by date I chose.</li>
            <li> Excellent article, efficient delivery</li>
            <li> These two items work very well in measuring body fat</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the general public...those interested in losing body fat and monitoring their progress. However, note that there are a lot of variables; time of day you takr the measurements, amount of water you drank, how far out you extend your arms....just be consistent with the way you do it each time and youll be able to see your progress.</li>
            <li> It seems that this device warrants more fine-tuning for individuals with little body fat.  With a very fit client with about 10% body fat it doesn&#x27;t register correctly. It may have been designed for the masses in general body fat ranges.&lt;br /&gt;I do like it however and it&#x27;s accurate otherwise.</li>
            <li> gresat product, very accurate</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and it&#x27;s so compact. The screen is nice and easy to read. I love this product</li>
            <li> It does the job, although slowly.  Stand really still and you will get your reading.  I&#x27;m using it as a diet aid.  It was recommended by my diet counselor.  It&#x27;s not too expensive, so I&#x27;m not out much really  even if it&#x27;s not really necessary.  I could just use the computer for BMI.  Knowing my body fat percentage is really a downer.  It does keep me motivated to stay on the plan.</li>
            <li> Its not accurate! As its off by +_ 3% margin.  The best bet is to just look in the mirror and measure with mayo tapes</li>
            <li> For me, a 5´4&amp;#34; 120 lbs. normal average women is very accurate and precise. I know it is not this way for everybody. I love the consistency of the readings, it only varies 1-2% or 2 lbs. at different times of the day, dressed, naked, after eating or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 23% at the moment and was 25.3% 3 months ago. it´s very motivating to see how body fat percentage get lowers with time. I do trust it´s readings because i compare myself to  pictures of women´s bellies at different fat percentage and I had a dexa test a while ago it came pretty close to my Tanita scale 2 hours after waking up, at that time i didn&#x27;t have the Omron but the device is very close to Tanita at 2 hours after waking up. so i guess it is close to dexa tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful to the Universe for having this device in my hands.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Very useful product. Its now being used by my staff and all of them rates the product very good. I would probably buy more in future.</li>
            <li> This product is not even close to accurate.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. item in great shape. I had tried this before, I already knew how to use it. It is very simple to use, great tool to have at hand if you are into fitness and nutrition education.</li>
            <li> The Fat Monitor was a little awkward to use the first time. I had a little confusion with the instructions but it got the job done. The measuring tape worked well. Good for some one who lives alone.</li>
            <li> workes like a charm. i didn&#x27;t realize when i ordered that i was going to get a skin caliper, but sure enough one came with it.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the Body Fat Monitor, it works great and is easy to use. However, I did not receive the body tape as it states.</li>
            <li> Works great! read other reviews so you know how to use it and how it can give false readings! A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lose weight for awhile, and I was getting discouraged with not seeing results. Being able to measure my body fat % and accurately measure different parts of my body has been very helpful!</li>
            <li> I am a doctor. I thought that this product would work for health screenings. It is not reliable. Most of the time, the total fat % is too high when I compare it with other techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you need to know that the beam only measures the upper body going to the waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using a tape measurer and doing a hip to waist fat analysis.</li>
            <li> I found that the measurements were wildly inconsistent.  If I did my measurements three consecutive times, I got 3 very different readings.  Because body fat doesn&#x27;t change a lot from day to day, inconsistent readings make this monitor pretty useless.  I returned it and got a Tanita Iron Man scale, which works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use, ready right out of the box . Great price for all that is included.</li>
            <li> This would have gotten the full 5 stars, but the measurement tape that was pictured/described/ordered was not sent with my package. The Omiron Fat Loss Monitor is great at helping me track (accurately) my fat loss percentage through my weight loss journey.</li>
            <li> Simple to use.  We love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very consistent results when you use per instructions. Seems very accurate to me. Very similar to professional results.</li>
            <li> The monitor works great it&#x27;s just like he one I used to have. But the tape measure that I only used twice is already breaking apart at the end where it attaches to the cylinder pin. But overall I&#x27;m happy with the Omron monitor.</li>
            <li> This proudct was exactly as ordered.  It&#x27;s easy to use and provides the information in seconds.  Has been helpful with personal training business.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and program. This has been super useful for tracking fat loss, and keeping me motivated even when the number on the scale isnt changing.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product itself...it is well-made, and exactly as presented...but it was just a foolish waste of money.  This was an impulse/indulgence sort of purchase -- I could have used the money to buy something much more worthwhile.  But if you&#x27;re really into measuring, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> I believe this monitor is much more accurate than a much more expensive stand-on BMI scale I have because this one is very consistent where as the scale one fluctuates a lot. I&#x27;m really happy I bought this and it is so easy to use. It saves your information so you don&#x27;t have to put it in every time and it is self explanatory, unlike many others which are much more complicated and you have to refer to the manual.</li>
            <li> This device is great for having around the house or for personal trainers. It reports BMI and Body Fat percentage. It also comes with a cheat sheet normal range card so you can see if your data is low / normal / high if you are not familiar with the metrics. To use the device you have to key in your height, age, gender, and weight. I like that you can save up to 9 people&#x27;s information in it so you can quickly test your and family without having to re-key in all your data each time. Since I offer in-home personal training I like it since it is portable. It is a quick test that I can do with new clients to get a baseline measurement and then take it back to them in a few weeks to get another measurement. There is a guest setting on it so you can enter new information into it without losing your personal/family settings.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a listing on Amazon for a few dollars less if you do not want the tap measure add on. The tape measure add on is good for measuring some type of body fat metric in obese clients or for measuring gains in muscles size in clients with a bodybuilding goal.</li>
            <li> First-since this reads by using electrical information, there are thing s that will cause variation-so you have to be consistent in how you measure. I follow what it says-at least 2 hours after eating or drinking anything substantial. I even try for the same time of day.&lt;br /&gt;to test it-I measured 2x&#x27;s a day for 5 days straight-at the same time. The morning reading never varied more than 1/2 of a percent from one day to the next, as did the afternoon. The biggest variance was-the morning one tended to be 1 percentage point lower than the afternoon one-but again consistently.  and hey-I&#x27;ve had the caliper pinch test before-it isn&#x27;t that accurate-this is more accurate and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;But the intention for this at this price isn&#x27;&#x27;t exact clinical accuracy anyway. If you are trying to change your body composition, then you just are worried about &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; anyway. If you take the measurement under the same conditions every time and record it, then you have a gauge to measure your change over time from your starting point. So you can tell if you are losing fat and not muscle...or gaining muscle and not fat...It&#x27;s less than 40 dollars and it works if used as directed, it isn&#x27;t an expensive medical device meant for use by elite athletic teams and trainers. it is Worth the $</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the BodyLogic for over a year now and it&#x27;s been really helpful in keeping me on track with my fitness goals. It&#x27;s also very portable which was important because in my previous job I traveled full-time. It has customization settings so you can add your age, height, etc. to get a more personalized reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to tracking my BF%, I use the Myotape to track my body measurements. It can be more useful than just tracking weight. Together they help you make the most of your fitness training.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a lot of good reviews about the product. I also purchased the manual caliper tool as well. I checked body fat with the caliper first and then the monitor. The results were exactly the so I only use this electronic one now. Since I am working out daily, I use the athletic setting.</li>
            <li> This unit has not been reliable for me or a friend who owns the exact same unit.  Take the reading 3 times in a row and you will often get a vastly different result each time. I&#x27;m sending mine back to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always see a difference on the scale but I feel a difference in my strength and size, and this is a handy way of scientifically verifying that. Easy to set up easy to use.</li>
            <li> This device does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s just a little &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; than I had hoped. But, all things considered, at this price point, it&#x27;s a good deal. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works amazing always wanted one an I use it everyday  I worked for l.a fitness so comes in handy thanks again</li>
            <li> The first time I came across this body fat device is at my local gym, where a PT (personal trainer) will measure this for me and all other important metrics so that he can sell me his services. I can&#x27;t bear to pay thousands of dollars for his PT training so decided to do it myself, including measuring / monitoring my own body fat, weight, dimensions, dieting and exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got it, the whole family has been using it everyday for measuring body fat and occasionally there will be some discrepancies, e.g. body fat % differs by 1-1.5% from one day to the next. We think it&#x27;s ok to allow for this because having the ability to measure our body fats conveniently and consistently help us in our weight management planning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fault for the price we paid, simply a great addition to our suite of health monitoring devices.</li>
            <li> As a Navy Sailor, physical fitness is a big deal.  We are required to give or take BF measurements often.  There is a great disparity between my recordable score and the reading that I get from this device.</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it gave wildly different readings. I followed the advice of a couple of other people and used it at the same time everyday, and it still varied by 6-12% each time. In addition the hand held body tape started at 2 1/4\\&quot; instead of at 0\\&quot; which made things difficult to get an accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> This is the same type body fat monitor that my nutritionist has and I love that I can track my body fat on my own at home.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll get frustrated like I did. Trying to program it to US was a little difficult but afterwords you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Very accurate for a handheld device.  only downfall is you could be given incorrect information to enter in the system</li>
            <li> Very useful equipment to track fitness progress.</li>
            <li> This works great! My clients enjoy checking in before they get in the FIT Bodywrap. And then checking it after to see how much fat they can burn.</li>
            <li> Quality product, better than a scale to measure progress towards weight loss goals, plus the measuring tape also helps too.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first but then started freezing up on me</li>
            <li> The monitor arrived promptly and appears to work well. The myotape however is not any easier than using a seamstress tape. The knob falls right out of the slot. I had to bulk it up with duct tape to make the fit snug enough so it would stay in place.</li>
            <li> The BF analyzer is honestly terrible. It reads me from 8.5 to 9.5%, and anyone looking at me could tell you I&#x27;m not that ripped. Save your money, and buy a DXA scan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape measure is pretty cool, great for measuring by yourself. That piece is definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t come with the measuring tape tool that  it was supposed to and took forever to get to me... Not an ideal experience.</li>
            <li> I was excited (maybe hopeful) to get this item due to the reviews. I was aware of the bad and the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It is consistent with the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The measurements (BF %) is OFF by at least 5% for &amp;#34;athletic&amp;#34; builds and maybe another 3% for regular builds.&lt;br /&gt;I know this because I have another bioscanner at work and am aware that I&#x27;m not close to being 12% but closer to 17-18% BF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I just get a bad scanner? Should I return?</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I hate the BMI measurements, because I work with police officers who are in no way, shape, or form overweight, but because of their muscle mass.  Since I am built more solid, weight loss has always been a rough go for me.  With these tools, I feel like I FINALLY have the right information for my weight loss and weight training to follow.  It is much easier to accept losing only 2 pounds, when I know that I have lost 4 pounds of fat and gained 2 pounds of muscle.  The Myotape is great for taking measurements by myself in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I like the monitor, it&#x27;s stable. The only problem was I received just the the monitor, I was waiting the MyoTape Body Tape too. But I recomend the monitor.</li>
            <li> The tape that came with it broke in a week.  The results on the Omron varies at times.  Not sure if  this product working consistently.</li>
            <li> The equipment arrived within one week and in excellent condition. My clients loved that they were able to see their BMI and body fat. For the tape measure, just be careful and hold the button down as you pull the tape out. Nobody wants to hear the endless clicks as you extend the tape for measurement.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how quickly the tape and body fat monitor came in. I was able to use the body fat monitor immediately on a few clients and it seemed to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> This device has really helped me to gage my fat burn accurately without a scale. I feel like I am making the proper progress</li>
    </ol>
