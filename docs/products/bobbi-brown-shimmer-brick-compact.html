            <li> I sometimes hesitate to use the powder forms of Blush, as they almost ALL have that marked tendency to remain on the skin&#x27;s surface, rather than sinking down into the skin for that &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34; look we all desire.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;shimmers&amp;#34; are subtle &amp; very well blended, leaving you w/ a dewy glow rather than a Disco Ball</li>
            <li> , otherwise it&#x27;s a little dark for daily use.</li>
            <li> But this glorious B. Brown Shimmer Blush avoids all those common mistakes, and instead strikes a home run in every department.</li>

            <li> Great color hint to my cheeks, love the product, however I would like more product or smaller case, it is kind of bulky. The blush itself is gorgeous though.</li>
            <li> Love Bobbi Brown. I have light skin so I use this as a bronzer when I get some sun, otherwise it&#x27;s a little dark for daily use.</li>
            <li> I sometimes hesitate to use the powder forms of Blush, as they almost ALL have that marked tendency to remain on the skin&#x27;s surface, rather than sinking down into the skin for that &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34; look we all desire. But this glorious B. Brown Shimmer Blush avoids all those common mistakes, and instead strikes a home run in every department. Although powder, it strokes on in an utterly creamy manner. The &amp;#34;shimmers&amp;#34; are subtle &amp; very well blended, leaving you w/ a dewy glow rather than a Disco Ball mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bronze shimmer is perfect for Fall. I received it in a kit and love the way it looks. I need to be careful, because one stroke is all I need on my fair skin, more than that is too too much. I like the way this bronze shimmer looks on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a glow that is luminous and it lasts. One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 10-15-13</li>
