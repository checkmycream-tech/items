            <li>I have the almond oil from this same company, and LOVE using it for massages or to mix with lotion; it moisturizes great!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and dries up smooth leaving no residue</li>
            <li>It is made from good ingredients and priced right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice smelling, but I love rose.</li>
            <li>It is light and feminine, yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Light rosey scent, not overly oily.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This oil is super light, glides on easily, and has never made me break out.</li>
            <li>There is a perfectly mild rose scent to this light and natural oil.</li>
            <li>I found the rose version and was looking forward to something that smelled pretty on top of that, but when I opened it up, it barely smelled at all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the gentle scent of this massage oil.  </li>
            <li>TOO SWEET.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT ITSELF WAS WARMING AND VERY SILKY SMOOTH !</li>
            <li>but i had no bad reaction to this at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I would order it again, I love that it has a nice rose smell without being to overpowering, I also like that it dries quickly and does not dry sticky or oily like other massage oil i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>(which led to mild breakouts on my back), I decided to give this massage oil a try since it was a good price.</li>
            <li>It caused us mild rashes.</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance but leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I also love the light scent, which is just enough without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN AMAZINGLY SOFT AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>IN IT SMELLS PURE AND SEDUCTIVE ALL</li>
            <li>VERY SUTTLE.</li>
            <li>It really does smell like roses</li>
            <li>and I received my order really fast.  </li>
            <li>It doesnâ€™t really smell like roses when you put in in your body.</li>
            <li>Very oily.</li>
            <li>Maybe we are using too much</li>
            <li>It also made us both very itchy.</li>
            <li>Very little rose scent.</li>
            <li>PURCHASED THIS FOR ME AND MY BOYFRIENDS ANNIVERSARY SINCE WE LOVE TO KEEP THINGS ROMANTIC AND PASSIONATE.</li>
            <li>This only smells like rose for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Oil has typical smooth feel, but also has subtle smell of rose, which was desired.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin soft and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is soft after and the sneaks lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>I use this as bath oil &amp; the rose scent is so faint as to be virtually undetectable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still good for a massage, but the scent was a disappointment.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and moisturized after using it that I sometimes use it as a lotion for my legs (especially if I&#x27;ve just shaved since it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like regular lotion will do).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not only does it smell wonderful, but it leaves your skin so nice and smooth and it is great for the skin.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the gentle scent of this massage oil.  It is light and feminine, yet not overpowering.  My husband and I both enjoy it.  It does not leave a greasy film, but rather absorbs well into our skin.  I will be purchasing more of this when we run out.</li>
            <li> Not very fragrant. Very little rose scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and I use it aromatherapy on myself. Nice product that I easily recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I brought this in hopes of a great rose smell. Nothing smells like olive oil more than anything else. It is moisturizer just no rose!</li>
            <li> works very well, smells great, so relaxing, two or should off I get into the tub and trying to get out of the tub I got up to 35 miles an hour. I was giving given a speeding ticket by a tub police</li>
            <li> Received the product in good order. So far so good. Appreciate the efficient service. It works well in the body. Does not leave oily residue.</li>
            <li> for some reason i was expecting more aroma smell from it, but it didn&#x27;t have much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regardless, the oil works great for massages. the oil lasts a good amount of time on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin- smells amazing and quite relaxing.  I use it in my massage business, especially around the head and neck... I also use it on my kids when they get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon doesn&#x27;t package it well tho- so order it with things you don&#x27;t care might get oil on; I ordered with a book and the book got oily.</li>
            <li> After using [[ASIN:B00113FWRG Plantlife Aromatherapy Massage Oil- 3 Pack]] (which led to mild breakouts on my back), I decided to give this massage oil a try since it was a good price. This oil is super light, glides on easily, and has never made me break out. My skin feels so soft and moisturized after using it that I sometimes use it as a lotion for my legs (especially if I&#x27;ve just shaved since it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like regular lotion will do). I also love the light scent, which is just enough without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my cats also love this massage oil. For whatever reason, they lick me when I use it (which is something they&#x27;ve never done before). Weird, but true.</li>
            <li> Great massage oil! It absorbs perfectly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue.  It goes on ever romantic getaway with me.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I have been looking for a nice smelling moisturizer that was easier to apply than coconut oil and this stuff is fantastic! There is a perfectly mild rose scent to this light and natural oil.</li>
            <li> I use this as bath oil &amp; the rose scent is so faint as to be virtually undetectable. It almost smells unscented.</li>
            <li> SO INDULGING..... THIS STUFF HITS THE SPOT EVERY TIME!! THE ROSE SCENT IN IT SMELLS PURE AND SEDUCTIVE ALL AT THE SAME TIME....</li>
            <li> Convenient sized container. Oil has typical smooth feel, but also has subtle smell of rose, which was desired. Not as greasy as baby oil; a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Light rosey scent, not overly oily. Liked using it and would order again.</li>

It&#x27;s still good for a massage, but the scent was a disappointment. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the almond oil from now on.</li>
            <li> It doesnâ€™t really smell like roses when you put in in your body. Very light fragrance but leaves your skin very soft. I will differently purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very oily. Maybe we are using too much but it&#x27;s a little hard to wash off for massages. It also made us both very itchy. It caused us mild rashes. Not sure if we will use it again. Seems like a great idea for people who might not be allergic to it and it smells really good! So I gave this a neutral rating because of that.</li>
            <li> A quality rose scented massage oil. It is plenty fragrant but not at all overpowering. It is made from good ingredients and priced right. I bought it for honeymoon massages and my bride loved it. So this will always be our &amp;#34;honeymoon&amp;#34; massage oil. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and dries up smooth leaving no residue</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful! A little thicker than I expected, but this is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> This only smells like rose for a few minutes then you can smell the carrier oil. Which doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I would order it again, I love that it has a nice rose smell without being to overpowering, I also like that it dries quickly and does not dry sticky or oily like other massage oil i&#x27;ve used. This leaves my skin soft and I have very sensitive skin but i had no bad reaction to this at all. An A++</li>
            <li> This is great for couples massage! Smells wonderful, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, and makes my skin feel awesome! Non-toxic, as well. ;)</li>
            <li> I think it smells nice all over the box. It leaked</li>
            <li> Soothing and pleasant rose fragrance best use is with an electric massager.</li>
