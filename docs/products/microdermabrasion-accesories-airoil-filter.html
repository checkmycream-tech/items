            <li> This seems like an insignificant part, but that&#x27;s not what it is at all. This piece keeps all the trash out of my $700.00 pump. Amazing how that works. In the setup of my machine this piece gave me peace of mind..</li>

            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the air/oil filter as I felt it cut down on the suction so I removed it.  I bought two additional and found I did not need to use them as the one that came with the machine was more than enough.  Unless I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m waiting for correction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very happy with the quality of the product &amp; it fit with my equipment  no ajustment need it  in order to fit</li>
