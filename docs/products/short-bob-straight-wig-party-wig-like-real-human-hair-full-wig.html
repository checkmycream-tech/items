            <li>Great wig.</li>
            <li>There is no shortage of hair so the coverage is good</li>
            <li>but all in all, it is a good quality wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to tamper with it because the quality and cut is great. :)</li>
            <li>I had to trim the bangs just a bit, but it is perfect for my first wig.</li>
            <li>however the texture is amazing</li>
            <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t expect it to feels so nice.</li>

            <li>Nice quality for the price point.</li>
            <li>I really liked this wig.</li>
            <li>so I have to wear this to work, but it is so comfortable and no one even noticed it&#x27;s a wig!</li>
            <li>This actually was a great buy!</li>
            <li>It fit my head perfectly (even with my long hair</li>
            <li>the fact that it got here very quickly</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on my smallish head and looks real!</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily and survived romping around Anime Expo in the heat and sun without much hair loss, combing needed and or random kinks (that form from leaning on it, shaving it in your bag or wearing a hat etc)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look the same as picture</li>
            <li> Fits nicely on my smallish head and looks real! I had to trim the bangs just a bit, but it is perfect for my first wig. I have green hair so I have to wear this to work, but it is so comfortable and no one even noticed it&#x27;s a wig!</li>
            <li> The bangs were cut funky, and the cut is wierd...I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it....however the texture is amazing</li>
            <li> for the price I read other reviews and thought this would be ok and it was it is very good for the price and the fact that it got here very quickly I give the manufacturer a 5 for getting it here to me. What I did not like is the fact that the hair is falling out just lets me know I will not be able to where this for a long period of time but it fit the bill thanks to the manufacturer and amazon</li>
            <li> Great Wig! Arrived in it.</li>
            <li> oMG this is garbage.. is there anyway I could leave negative -15 stars not happy at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was bad not what I wanted</li>
            <li> Looks very fake, feels like plastic</li>
            <li> This actually was a great buy! There is no shortage of hair so the coverage is good and it keeps the netting hidden. But what I like most is the silly hair texture. For the price I didn&#x27;t expect it to feels so nice. Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily and survived romping around Anime Expo in the heat and sun without much hair loss, combing needed and or random kinks (that form from leaning on it, shaving it in your bag or wearing a hat etc) Also didn&#x27;t need to fuss with it much to work on my Haku from Spirited Away cosplay!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this wig, it&#x27;s my go to wig, my first choice to wear.</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful wig,  high quality,  but it fits a little large on the top of my head and in the back.  The tightening hooks didn&#x27;t really fix it.  I&#x27;m still going to tamper with it because the quality and cut is great. :)</li>
            <li> This is the worst wig I have ever brought the cap is too big and when you brush it all the hair falls out. I will never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering me another one soon</li>
            <li> This wig was great! It fit my head perfectly (even with my long hair, I just put my hair in a low bun). I used it in a dance performance and it stayed perfectly placed the three times I performed. Everyone complimented the wig and it was a great deal too!</li>
            <li> This wig was better than I expected.  Nice quality for the price point.</li>
            <li> Terrible I had to cut bang and it sheds everywhere.And very shiny</li>
            <li> No good n about to send it back</li>
            <li> I really liked this wig. It is a bit messy and the hair comes off a little when combing it but all in all, it is a good quality wig. My only complaint would be that it appears to be a little shorter than the one in the picture, but other than that, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great wig. Im very happy.</li>
