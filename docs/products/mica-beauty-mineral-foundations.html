    <ol>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST COVER UP</li>

            <li>after using Mac products for 15 years I have successfully switched to mica now my skin is healthier than ever!</li>
            <li>This make up is fool proof and will always give you great results.</li>
            <li>People are always telling me what great skin I have, but I know MicaBeauty is making my skin look that way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, the packaging is the reason I&#x27;m giving this a one star review.</li>
            <li>Has great coverage</li>
            <li>Great for combination skin type.</li>
            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I use this as a concealer and a foundation and it covers all my blemishes and leaves my skin looking smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>It looks good but not quite as good as when the salesperson demonstrated it.</li>
            <li>, I love it!</li>
            <li>great glow, light, but build-able coverage.</li>
            <li>I was shown this product at the Coastal Mall in Myrtle Beach, I liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect all year round!! ♥</li>
            <li>I was so happy after reading the reviews and when I opened it, the color was off and it just was not as pretty as the foundation that I bought at a Willowbend Mall kiosk, in Dallas, TX.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>Not so sure about this product</li>
            <li>Bought this make up for years and still love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Mica Bella for such a wonderful cosmetic line.</li>
            <li>Since the grist I try this makeup I fall in love</li>
            <li>Love the way it blends in with my color, I will not consider buying another brand.</li>
            <li>I tried it at the mall and loved the way it feels on my face really light and exact for my color, lasts all day</li>
            <li>and she love it and want more I buy more next time this good choise for wemon</li>
            <li>I will just wait and try to buy the quality of Mica that I originally had.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Very light on your face and last all day, been using it for two years now and still love it and the price.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I tried this two years ago at a kiosk in my local mall and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, long lasting, even coverage.</li>
            <li>receiving the product, I found it to be exactly as my last MicaBeauty foundation - brand new with the same great color and skin-enhancing power - but much nicer on my credit card.  </li>
            <li>Light coverage and just enough.</li>
            <li>that makes my face itch and is found in many other mineral make up</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;t find any other foundation better than this one.</li>
            <li>this has high quality ingredients, no bismuth ???</li>
            <li>I have naturally very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need foundation for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>This 9gram will last most of us a year, thats if you dont ware it everyday.</li>
            <li>Also similar to Bare Mineral but a little more affordable.  </li>
            <li>But nothing a little clean up couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not only was it messy, but a waste of product.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my foundation at the mica Bella kiosk in my local mall, but decided to purchase it on amazon since it was a little cheaper.</li>

            <li> I will be returning to my usual powder foundation which I will now have to use to cover up my break out.</li>
            <li> have been buying the product on amazon for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> but once i tried Mica Bella I saw a dramatic difference and have been hooked on this product line ever since.</li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time finding a foundation that does not cause blemishes or acne.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but it was very expensive, so I looked for it on Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My sister want it and she love it and want more I buy more next time this good choise for wemon</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE THIS IS THE BEST COVER UP EVER .....AND A LOT CHEAPER THEN THEM MALL GIRLS TRYING TO SELL IT</li>
            <li> I was looking for a foundation that would be a close match to my completion. Also similar to Bare Mineral but a little more affordable.  Well I finally found it in this! I tried this two years ago at a kiosk in my local mall and fell in love with it. I use this as a concealer and a foundation and it covers all my blemishes and leaves my skin looking smooth and flawless. This 9gram will last most of us a year, thats if you dont ware it everyday. But for those that ware it everyday it should last for a little over 6mo because it doesn&#x27;t take a lot. Very light on your face and last all day, been using it for two years now and still love it and the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a different brand of make up in over 3 years. This make up is fool proof and will always give you great results. Covers up any imperfections.</li>
            <li> I was shown this product at the Coastal Mall in Myrtle Beach, I liked it but it was very expensive, so I looked for it on Amazon.  It looks good but not quite as good as when the salesperson demonstrated it.</li>
            <li> I am an over 50 woman. I have had a difficult time finding a foundation that does not cause blemishes or acne. I have been using this product for a year. I could not get it in my town and found when I ran out and used another mineral powder, I broke out. I am grateful that I can purchase on line. After ordering, the product was at my door within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I purchase this way again, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> I use MicaBeauty Mineral Foundation 5, Cappuccino after applying my blush.  It softens the blush and gives my skin the appearance of perfection.  People are always telling me what great skin I have, but I know MicaBeauty is making my skin look that way.  I am also a Mary Kay purchaser, but the Mary Kay foundation does not begin to cover and enhance my skin like MicaBeauty Mineral Foundation.  I give MicaBeauty a five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the product, I found it to be exactly as my last MicaBeauty foundation - brand new with the same great color and skin-enhancing power - but much nicer on my credit card.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used this foundation for about 5 years and will continue to use it. I only have to buy it once a year as a little goes a long way.  5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Great product, long lasting, even coverage.</li>
            <li> I was so happy after reading the reviews and when I opened it, the color was off and it just was not as pretty as the foundation that I bought at a Willowbend Mall kiosk, in Dallas, TX.  I guess I got what I paid for.  I will just wait and try to buy the quality of Mica that I originally had.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my foundation at the mica Bella kiosk in my local mall, but decided to purchase it on amazon since it was a little cheaper. I&#x27;m happy with the product, the packaging is the reason I&#x27;m giving this a one star review. There was nothing in the box to keep the foundation from moving, so when I opened it the powder was all over the box &amp; container. Not only was it messy, but a waste of product. Next time I&#x27;ll just spend the little extra money at the mall.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T LOOK THE SAME AS WHEN THEY PUT IT ON MY SKIN BUT IT IS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Not so sure about this product</li>
            <li> Bought this make up for years and still love it... Cheaper on Amazon than the mall..</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Has great coverage</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product. I have naturally very sensitive skin so when I read about this product I thought it would be perfect. I was wrong. Not only did this product sink into my pores it was patchy and all around unattractive. It caused me to break out something that has not happened in years. I will be returning to my usual powder foundation which I will now have to use to cover up my break out. If you have ever struggled with pore size or dryness do not buy this garbage.</li>
            <li> Door years i used MAC products but once i tried Mica Bella I saw a dramatic difference and have been hooked on this product line ever since. My granddaughter us hooked a well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mica Bella for such a wonderful cosmetic line.</li>
            <li> Been using for a year. Seems the same as at the kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li> great glow, light, but build-able coverage. this has high quality ingredients, no bismuth ??? that makes my face itch and is found in many other mineral make up</li>
            <li> they have this product at the mall for over $60. I tried it at the mall and loved the way it feels on my face really light and exact for my color, lasts all day and I don&#x27;t need foundation for complete coverage. have been buying the product on amazon for the past 2 years. also it lasts about 6-9 months before it finishes and I wear it daily sometimes 2 times a day. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Since the grist I try this makeup I fall in love it feels like you wearing nothing plus it does break me out !!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> after using Mac products for 15 years I have successfully switched to mica now my skin is healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> Love the way it blends in with my color, I will not consider buying another brand.</li>
            <li> Great for combination skin type. I used it for a while now and it is great. I could&#x27;t find any other foundation better than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and does not make my face itch like BE, I love it! It&#x27;s perfect all year round!! ♥</li>
            <li> The make-up is wonderful. Light coverage and just enough. Never overbearing. The packaging was a little off when I received it. It was overfilled and it spilled all over my hands. But nothing a little clean up couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
