            <li>Eye bright is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think this product promised way more than it delivered.</li>
            <li>Does everything it is suppose to do and more.  </li>
            <li>Love DHC products...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And yes, I do get plenty of sleep. :-)</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would be able to see more of a difference after I used this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It makes my eyes brighter, more awake, and</li>
            <li>Helped under eye discoloration as well as dryness; better than Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is colorless and will not interfere with your makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product for a new mom.</li>
            <li>this is, hands down, the very very best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure my eyes look better when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I had heard such great things about it.  </li>
            <li>So far I have loved everything I&#x27;ve used from DHC and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and perhaps is a good moisturizer, but I have to say I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing sensation this gel has in my eye, I just love it!  </li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>I loved the product when I received the sample from the actual company and my opinion remains unchanged.  </li>
            <li>Saw results quickly</li>
            <li>The area under my 68 year old eyes really responds to Eye Bright</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample of Eye Bright through the mail a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to most eye serums and creams and this product just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>But, it washes right off with water.  </li>
            <li>Right away, I noticed how this product made my eyes feel \\&quot;awake\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many various types, all designed to reduce puffiness, and none work like this one!</li>
            <li>and, my face is soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel dry when I apply Eye Bright, but it could be only me.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell any difference after I pat it around my eye area.</li>
            <li>Not expensive, and more than worth the priceâ€¦plus, a tiny dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li>really brightens your eye area</li>
            <li>really zaps under eye swelling.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference as far as brightening.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and new, as pictured.</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times and because I have sensitive skin, I started to burn</li>
            <li>I got a free sample in the mail and after a few days I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  </li>
            <li>so puffy eyes are a real concern of mine and this definitely helps.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my under eye area feel, however haven&#x27;t used long enough to see full effect.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, DHC is the only thing I can and will use..</li>
            <li>I have no expectations of long-term results, and I like that the formula is simple, natural and synergistic.</li>
            <li>This actually makes tired eyes wake up and gives the impression of a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>

            <li> I have used other under eye creams for under eye puffiness and dark circles, but this product irritates my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Reduces puffy eyes and dark circles</li>

            <li> less dark-circly as soon as I apply it.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman, many mornings my eyes are puffy when I wake up for no good or bad reason.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a little while</li>
            <li> A little is all that is needed around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would complain about is a little goes a long way, but it is difficult to get a small amount out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I have year round, indoor and outdoor allergies</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause creasing in my makeup.</li>

            <li> Such a refreshing sensation this gel has in my eye, I just love it!  I think now on I will use it, also has excellent ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of Eye Bright through the mail a few months ago.  Now that I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman, many mornings my eyes are puffy when I wake up for no good or bad reason.  I always use Olay Regenerist which I like, but I added Eye Bright to the morning routine until the sample ran out.  I could see a difference.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else did, because no one talks about my puffy eyes to me:)&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the sample encouraged me to purchase a tube.</li>
            <li> I used this for a little while but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference as far as brightening. Keeping in the fridge did help with morning puffiness.</li>
            <li> I really love this makeup remover!!  It&#x27;s greasy but, which helps it to cut through the makeup and grime. . .no hard  But, it washes right off with water.  I wash with soap afterwards and, my face is soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure my eyes look better when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Not too big of a deal. I think this product promised way more than it delivered. Not too happy here</li>
            <li> This does shrink some of the &#x27;morning puffiness&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye gel!  Works well and once dry, it&#x27;s not tacky.</li>
            <li> Eye bright is fantastic. I use this product day &amp; night. Reduces puffy eyes and dark circles</li>
            <li> This is definitely a superior product.  It doesn&#x27;t disappoint!  Does everything it is suppose to do and more.  This product has my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> i use this and can immediately see the puffiness reduce.  not sure about long term benefits but we will see.</li>
            <li> Love DHC products... Having sensitive skin, DHC is the only thing I can and will use.. Bright eyes give me that wake up look after a sleepless night..</li>
            <li> still trying this out too</li>
            <li> This product works great for both women and  men. My husband and I both use the product, and have already reordered our second tube. The product tightens and brightens under eyes. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great. Saw results quickly</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times and because I have sensitive skin, I started to burn so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes look brighter immediately after use!</li>
            <li> Great product for a new mom. Item arrived on time and new, as pictured. Feels like cool cucumbers around eyes- a wonderful treat after sleepless nights. Don&#x27;t know if it removes wrinkles but eye area feels refreshed after using it, does not have a smell</li>
            <li> The absolute best gel for tightening up the under-eye area. Cool. Soothing. And a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised to reduce dark circles. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff!!! It gives instant results, my eyes are much brighter, not puffy looking, it makes them look tight and well rested!! Love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I loved the product when I received the sample from the actual company and my opinion remains unchanged.  This actually makes tired eyes wake up and gives the impression of a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  I have had o breakouts or skin irritation and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> this is, hands down, the very very best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;ve tried so many various types, all designed to reduce puffiness, and none work like this one! The gel is cooling, soothing, and within 15 min of putting it on, my eyes are back to normal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have issues with under-eye bags (which is not puffiness, but the fat pad in the lower eyelid having dropped) as that does not run in my family, but I do have issues with allergies and I wear contacts, so periodically, I wake to find that my eyes are quite swollen, both upper and lower lids. This takes care of it every single time!</li>
            <li> Tightens well physically and visibly.</li>
            <li> great eye gel, helps with puff and wrinkle</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in the mail and after a few days I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  It was easier to order from Amazon so I ordered it here.  I am a believer!  This is great.</li>
            <li> I have had good results</li>
            <li> Like the others here, I also received a sample of Eye Bright. Right away, I noticed how this product made my eyes feel \\&quot;awake\\&quot;. This stuff is like coffee for your eyes. I love it. Try it. You can get a sample on their site by ordering a catalog. (You get a few different samples), then come here to buy it cheaper.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and perhaps is a good moisturizer, but I have to say I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my dark circles. And yes, I do get plenty of sleep. :-)</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel. Less puffiness under eyes, somewhat less dark too. Only thing I would complain about is a little goes a long way, but it is difficult to get a small amount out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would be able to see more of a difference after I used this eye cream.  I had heard such great things about it.  It feels good but I really can&#x27;t tell any difference after I pat it around my eye area.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! People have noticed the difference in my eye appearance! I feel great too!</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most eye serums and creams and this product just doesn&#x27;t work for me. My eyes feel dry when I apply Eye Bright, but it could be only me.  Korres 24 hour moisturizing &amp; brightening cream is the only cream that works for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye treatment I&#x27;ve ever used that does what it says. It makes my eyes brighter, more awake, and less dark-circly as soon as I apply it. I have no expectations of long-term results, and I like that the formula is simple, natural and synergistic. Not expensive, and more than worth the priceâ€¦plus, a tiny dab goes a long way. Excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> Helped under eye discoloration as well as dryness; better than Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> really brightens your eye area</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see a difference after using for three weeks</li>
            <li> Loved it. A little goes a long way. Love the fact that it is colorless and will not interfere with your makeup.</li>
            <li> really zaps under eye swelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star even before i receive the product.  I received a sample at the airportâ€¦you know, when they grab you and tell you it&#x27;&#x27;ll be just a secondâ€¦and it&#x27;s not.  I didn&#x27;t buy because they wanted  (their best price) $90.  I have tried the sample until it ran out and it is amazing.  It almost eliminates my dark circles and lines.  Try it next time they stop you but but it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great when I wake up with puffy eyes.  Works within minutes.  Must be the caffeine.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A little is all that is needed around the eye area. It&#x27;s non greasy and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I have used other under eye creams for under eye puffiness and dark circles, but this product irritates my eyes.  I will go back to a cheaper product that works.  That one came from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> The area under my 68 year old eyes really responds to Eye Bright and i have used it for years.  One of my favorite products on the market.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my under eye area feel, however haven&#x27;t used long enough to see full effect.</li>
            <li> This definitely seems to perk up my eyes and reduce puffiness in the morning! I have year round, indoor and outdoor allergies so puffy eyes are a real concern of mine and this definitely helps. It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause creasing in my makeup. It is not very moisturizing which is my only complaint. I am very impressed and this may be the first eye care product I repurchase. So far I have loved everything I&#x27;ve used from DHC and this is no exception. Performs like a much more expensive product.</li>
