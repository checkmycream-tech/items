            <li>But overall its cute.</li>
            <li>I would definitely go out in public with it and its super cute!</li>
            <li>Was nicer than expected - Wore it on Halloween, and gave it to someone afterwards, because they liked it so much</li>
            <li>It was a little thin but besides that it is a really nice wig and good quality!</li>
            <li>Fits large head well.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li>People who do not know me don&#x27;t even know that I am wearing a wig because it looks so realistic!  </li>
            <li>It looks so realistic too!</li>
            <li>It is very shiny.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I am using it for a play I am in and it is very close to the color of my real hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seam very curly in the picture</li>
            <li>This wig is shiny and very curly.  </li>
            <li>Looks real.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very well made, the curls and Hair to me seem a bit lopsided</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very long.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Bye.</li>
            <li>I love it, especially when I use it to display my hair accessories in order to take professional pictures.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with such a quality one at such an affordable price that enables you to order the new one to replace when it is needed.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re silky and manageable, but realistic.</li>
            <li>many curls,,way too much,,alot of hair on bottom but way too thin on top,,cap way to big,,i have to send it back,no way to make it fit right,,you</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting a wig brush with it.</li>
            <li>This short curly brown wig is really nice, in texture, so soft and the color is exactly what I like, even though I&#x27;d prefer having a few strands of highlighter.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easily styled and so far extremely durable.</li>
            <li>very natural looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>Quality of the wig was about the same as higher priced wigs, color was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely purchase another wig for any other plays that require me to wear one from this company.</li>
            <li>Pretty, just like the picture, not for big heads.</li>
            <li>It arrived really early and looks incredibly natural!</li>
            <li>These wigs are just as pictured as far as style and color.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this wig is that it is REALLY curly.</li>
            <li>Its not too shiny and really soft.</li>
            <li>Good ones are so expensive</li>
            <li>I was very surprised in the high quality and apearance of this wig for the very low price I paid for it and would recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li>Took a very long time to arrive, but does feel and look like real hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show but the weight might be less than the full back.</li>
            <li>-  have to put hair pins to keep rom sliding on head -fast shipping but other than that it was okay not really for everyday use.</li>
            <li>But overall I like it and the hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>Much curler then expected.</li>
            <li>can easy see the netting inside the cap,,way to thin on top,,,so</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s fine, but the hair is impossible to comb out - I think it would pull right off the wig.</li>

            <li> The cap seems durable but I not to sure how long it will last due to the wefts being so thin.</li>
            <li> Either the hair was long enough that maintaining it was a pain in the butt, or it was so short that the look just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I am new to buying wigs, so I am a little reluctant to using a culing iron on it.</li>
            <li> The fringe is also long but you can fix that with scissors.</li>
            <li> The delivery was earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and I even tired to brush the curls out a bit and just didn&#x27;t look right...</li>
            <li> Too loose.</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve worked but either I have a big head or Asian people have small heads</li>
            <li> but my only complaint (as a hairdresser who wears wigs to work regularly) is that it was way too shiney.</li>
            <li> The way the hair lays looks real, but the individual strands are sooo shiney you can tell its fake.</li>
            <li> Not much about it.</li>
            <li> looks nothing like the picture and was way to big on my small head</li>
            <li> However the wig cap is very big; if you have a small head you *will* need to make adjustments or take it to a wig specialist to have it</li>
            <li> I am disabled and on a limited income.  </li>
            <li> this wig was curlier past shoulder reddish brown than pictures- bangs a little too long  </li>
            <li> I had to put powder in it to take the shine down a little.</li>
            <li> It was a little less curly than the pictures -</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant because of the reviews, but i went with my gut and WAS NOT DISAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little Thin in the back</li>
            <li> But probably it wasn&#x27;t intended for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair due to medical problems</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be wary of is shedding.  </li>
            <li> but this one seems a bit small for me</li>
            <li> It might be also due to the front being a bit thin.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no way I could wear this out without worrying about it slowly sliding off/sideways my head.</li>
            <li> Sorry for ordering it.</li>
            <li> different than the one on the picture;looks horrible</li>
            <li> I have expensive wigs that don&#x27;t even compare!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little Thin in the back but it will do. I like how the curls are and it looks longer in person than in the picture which is good. The cap seems durable but I not to sure how long it will last due to the wefts being so thin. It is very shiny. I had to put powder in it to take the shine down a little. The fringe is also long but you can fix that with scissors. But overall I like it and the hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> These wigs are just as pictured as far as style and color. They&#x27;re silky and manageable, but realistic. I&#x27;m using them for halloween mannequins, and my heads look pretty convincing with these wigs on! They&#x27;re easily styled and so far extremely durable. Would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a shorter length wig that looked good for years. Either the hair was long enough that maintaining it was a pain in the butt, or it was so short that the look just didn&#x27;t work for me. This is a wonderful middle ground that was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> very nice hair feels so real very manageable a trait I have not seen in other wigs purchased on this site.</li>
            <li> Much curler then expected. Looks fake on top. Rest looks ok</li>
            <li> Same as pictured heat resistant</li>
            <li> Poor quality, doesn&#x27;t fit my head. Nice color but it is different of my expectation. Sorry for ordering it.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised in the high quality and apearance of this wig for the very low price I paid for it and would recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. This wig was amazing.  I was a little reluctant because of the reviews, but i went with my gut and WAS NOT DISAPOINTED. This was litrerally waaay better than the thirty six dollar five star wig i bought last year. Its so beautiful and so so soft. The only thing you have to be wary of is shedding.  PLEASE dont take it out and comb it with a regular. I would highly recommend getting a wig brush with it. please.purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to wear these. I&#x27;m sure someone with experience may like them.</li>
            <li> great wig for the price.Fits large head well.</li>
            <li> this wig was curlier past shoulder reddish brown than pictures- bangs a little too long  -  have to put hair pins to keep rom sliding on head -fast shipping but other than that it was okay not really for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Quality of the wig was about the same as higher priced wigs, color was as advertised.  I would recommend this site to a friend.</li>
            <li> This short curly brown wig is really nice, in texture, so soft and the color is exactly what I like, even though I&#x27;d prefer having a few strands of highlighter. The delivery was earlier than expected. I don&#x27;t remember if there was a way to choose the size but this one seems a bit small for me so I feel like it would slide backward. It might be also due to the front being a bit thin. It doesn&#x27;t show but the weight might be less than the full back. Overall, I am happy with such a quality one at such an affordable price that enables you to order the new one to replace when it is needed. I definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> This has been an amazing wig.  I am using it for a play I am in and it is very close to the color of my real hair.  People who do not know me don&#x27;t even know that I am wearing a wig because it looks so realistic!  I would most definitely purchase another wig for any other plays that require me to wear one from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a very very curly wig....It didn&#x27;t seam very curly in the picture but it is,  and I even tired to brush the curls out a bit and just didn&#x27;t look right... Just wasn&#x27;t for me but my kids love it.</li>
            <li> This wig is shiny and very curly.  It is exactly as shown in picture.  Great for baseball cap.  The cut is perfect.</li>
            <li> The wig is lovely in appearance.  I primarily use it for my mannequins and the wig keeps its wave pretty well.  The wig is not curly however, it is like the picture.  I will mention that static is a problem.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig for the price!  Just didn&#x27;t work for my style.  Very pretty in person</li>
            <li> It good nice thick hair good quality wig look good but hard to manage can&#x27;t bush it but good over all</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WIG! It arrived really early and looks incredibly natural! I have expensive wigs that don&#x27;t even compare! I recommend this for anyone! And at this price its just perfection! It looks so realistic too! I would definitely go out in public with it and its super cute! I love it!</li>
            <li> perfect color, exact same as in picture...very natural looking and feeling.  Love it!  Great for everyday or just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to arrive, but does feel and look like real hair.  What I needed.</li>
            <li> looks nothing like the picture and was way to big on my small head</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this wig is that it is REALLY curly. I am new to buying wigs, so I am a little reluctant to using a culing iron on it.</li>
            <li> The wig got here, seemed okay. Second it got out of the netting- I felt as though I was hold a shedding cat. Nice wig but so much shedding.</li>
            <li> Love this wig! Looks real.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this considerable</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I just ordered 2 more of the same item.  Color, texture, fit was perfect.  Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and on a limited income.  I have very thin hair due to medical problems so I wear wigs all the time.  Good ones are so expensive so I decided to try this.  For the price it is worth it but I wish it was a little thicker. I realize they say these are for costumes. That is why I gave it 5 star&#x27;s. I am able to wear this and nobody is the wiser. ;)</li>
            <li> looks beautiful on her! he loves it ! she says it is one of her best wigs. It keeps its shape and looks life like and stunning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything they said it would be!  I really am enjoying it!  I love the color and how soft it feels.  I am getting lots of compliments too!</li>
            <li> Full thick bouncy curls on the last half of the wig, thick full crown and bangs.Perfect amount of shine with no excess. This wig falls to about the shoulders, is not overly full, so it gives off the perfect appearance. This wig was so worth the money and the wait of shipping. I will certainly be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> It was a little thin but besides that it is a really nice wig and good quality!</li>
            <li> This was for my granddaughter and she looks darling in it. She wears it quite often and it is holding up well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Not much about it. Just a wig.</li>
            <li> Came on time looks just like the picture. I knew the hair was synthetic when i purchased it but my only complaint (as a hairdresser who wears wigs to work regularly) is that it was way too shiney. The way the hair lays looks real, but the individual strands are sooo shiney you can tell its fake. Would be perfect for a night out when you are not under direct fluorescent lighting. Great quality for the price. All in all i am very happy.</li>
            <li> shipping form china takes FOREVER but the wig itself is nice quality.</li>
            <li> Was nicer than expected - Wore it on Halloween, and gave it to someone afterwards, because they liked it so much</li>
            <li> Too loose. ..hair is falling out..</li>
            <li> This wig looks good and the quality is nice but you can tell its a wig. Some people said they couldn&#x27;t and some said they could. But overall its cute.</li>
            <li> Love the curls in this one it&#x27;s very well made, the curls and Hair to me seem a bit lopsided but it&#x27;s probably just me,most wigs look that way to me. it was worth the but even if I don&#x27;t wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s honestly pretty good. However the wig cap is very big; if you have a small head you *will* need to make adjustments or take it to a wig specialist to have it fitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I was able to stitch the wig cap to a smaller size and now it fits much better. As such I&#x27;m adding a star.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Can&#x27;t complain at all.. I&#x27;m satisfied N pleased with my purchased.. Thank you MapofBeauty Fashion...</li>
            <li> Gets very tangled very easy and Won&#x27;t brush out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute and is very high quality.. the style is great and when brushed not a lot of hair fell out.</li>
            <li> I waited for this wig for awhile. But it was definitely worth the wait! This wig is an auburn brown and looks great on me. Its been a struggle getting a wig that&#x27;s just the right color, and this one is it for me. The curls at the bottom goes to my shoulders, and its not itchy when you are wearing the wig cap that came with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty, just like the picture, not for big heads.</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve worked but either I have a big head or Asian people have small heads (please, let the latter be true!!), there&#x27;s no way I could wear this out without worrying about it slowly sliding off/sideways my head. But probably it wasn&#x27;t intended for everyday wear. It&#x27;d be great if you wear it to a dress-up party, it&#x27;s nice enough.</li>
            <li> It looks too fake.&lt;br /&gt;Constant shading of hair&lt;br /&gt;Color was nice.&lt;br /&gt;It looks fake.&lt;br /&gt;It is very long.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Bye.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality wig for my purposes.  I use it on my mannequin head to photograph the hats I make.  It is perfect!</li>
            <li> Its a great buy. I love it, especially when I use it to display my hair accessories in order to take professional pictures. Its not too shiny and really soft.</li>
            <li> A very pretty wig. Shipping could be faster but it&#x27;s a good value and wife recommends it.</li>
            <li> Hair too shiny otherwise an O.K. wig, just not for me.</li>
            <li> just got this wig today,,pretty color,,too many curls,,way too much,,alot of hair on bottom but way too thin on top,,cap way to big,,i have to send it back,no way to make it fit right,,you can easy see the netting inside the cap,,way to thin on top,,,so disappointed,,the reviews was so great on this piece,,really dont understand why</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the quality of this wig for the price. Looks great on and am working on styling it in various ways -- truly a great buy!</li>
            <li> I really really liked this one!  I needed to trim the bangs - but I&#x27;m okay with that!  It was a little less curly than the pictures - but I still love it! It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the coverage is great!!!</li>
            <li> a bit to long but still a nice wig</li>
            <li> I love the wig but I still need to do some work on it to get it perfect like the way I would like. I recommend it as a cosplayer and hope to be getting another wig soon. :)</li>
            <li> The wig fit perfectly and snuggly. It is going to be perfect for my Korra cosplay.</li>
            <li> My partner loved it for her amateur dramatics class, and now she wants me to wear it for Halloween!! But it clashes with my beard!!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s fine, but the hair is impossible to comb out - I think it would pull right off the wig. So you need to be happy with the touseled look.</li>
            <li> different than the one on the picture;looks horrible</li>
