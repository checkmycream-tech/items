            <li>I ordered a four-pack to last me six months in country, when I received it, it also included four travel sticks of Clinical strength degree, these are perfect for travelling!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought This Deodorant for my Son, and he is extremely satisfied with the results of this product...  </li>

            <li>Keeps me dry and smells great!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this deodorant from Afghanistan and I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that throughout the day as he moves and sweats, the deodorant still smells fresh up until the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Wearing this stuff is like taking a bath in cheap 50&#x27;s era barbershop cologne.  </li>

            <li>So far this is the one I enjoy the most.  </li>
            <li>Fine, I wear a suit to work and spend most of my time outside...</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t keep you smelling fresh...</li>
            <li>If you &amp; your loved ones have nostalgic memories of living in a brine factory, this might be a good antiperspirant for you.</li>
            <li>I think the other scents are good too.  </li>
            <li>I will order more Degree in the future.</li>
            <li>It smells good and does the job, but it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough without being over-powering.</li>
            <li>Has a tendancey to flake off but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Working pretty good but for some strange reason not as well as other adrenaline series Degree brand.</li>
            <li>Makes sure I only smell slightly gross!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I checked the expiration dates and it was not expired but it was about a year older than all the sticks at my local store (I checked).  </li>
            <li>Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the clinical but almost as much active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry clear and comes off on clothes.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry clear and comes off on clothes.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as what I consider average dry time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of buying and happily using Degree for Men Deodorant With Time Release Technology (INTENSE SPORT), I made the horrible mistake of trying out this other Degree (Adrenaline Sport), and all I can say is that of the 4 I purchaed, have not even made it through 1/4 of one b/c</li>
            <li> It leaves marks on clothes, and slowly marks up whatever chair you spend most of your day in as it (slowly) comes out sleeves.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, and I somewhat like the smell.</li>
            <li> it keeps me dry almost as well as the &#x27;clinical&#x27; stuff.</li>
            <li> Apparently body-heat activates the special vinegar-based aroma, which began grating my poor sinuses with broken glass about 5 minutes after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is not worth the dollar</li>
            <li> The sour, acidic smell is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel weird about it since it is old.  </li>
            <li> But seriously.  </li>
            <li> it not only smells BAD, but the scent will give you headaches!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it went on weird feeling.</li>
            <li> Horrible product- learn from my mistake.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the scent of this product and provides me very good protection while active.</li>
            <li> Works well but has a medicine like smell.</li>
            <li> Has a tendancey to flake off but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love the temperature activation and sent.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> This is the only Degree that works for me.</li>
            <li> Best mens deodorant out there. My husband has tried them all and this one works best for him. I love that throughout the day as he moves and sweats, the deodorant still smells fresh up until the end of the day.</li>
            <li> A deodorant is a deodorant is a deodorant. This has a great scent and works well as an antiperspirant too. I don&#x27;t think it lasts 24 hours but this does seem to reactivate when exercising. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> works and smells good.  But get stressed out and you&#x27;ll bust &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; through the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s just like the rest, marketing to be &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34;, but just the same stuff in a different tube.</li>
            <li> Pretty good anti perspirant but doesn&#x27;t keep you smelling fresh... I&#x27;ll stick with the adrenaline series from now on...</li>
            <li> A great value and so convenient that gets delivered right to the door.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and smells great!  I think the other scents are good too.  I use this every day and it works great.</li>
            <li> Wearing this stuff is like taking a bath in cheap 50&#x27;s era barbershop cologne.  The sour, acidic smell is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I smelled this in the store before buying, it posed in the guise as a benign odor.  Apparently body-heat activates the special vinegar-based aroma, which began grating my poor sinuses with broken glass about 5 minutes after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the applicator is well designed.  If you &amp; your loved ones have nostalgic memories of living in a brine factory, this might be a good antiperspirant for you.</li>
            <li> This is not only a great smelling deodorant; it lasts the whole day and longer!  I ordered this deodorant from Afghanistan and I received it very quickly.  I ordered a four-pack to last me six months in country, when I received it, it also included four travel sticks of Clinical strength degree, these are perfect for travelling!  It might just be deodorant to anybody else, but to me, it is a comfort item that is a necessity in country.</li>
            <li> It smells good and does the job, but it&#x27;s messy. It leaves marks on clothes, and slowly marks up whatever chair you spend most of your day in as it (slowly) comes out sleeves. I&#x27;m applying one swipe only and it still happens. Not invisible at all.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant to use forever</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the ease of not having to leave my house but when I got it, it went on weird feeling.I checked the expiration dates and it was not expired but it was about a year older than all the sticks at my local store (I checked).  It still works but it I feel weird about it since it is old.  In my opinion it is not worth the dollar you save over buying at the store.</li>
            <li> Working pretty good but for some strange reason not as well as other adrenaline series Degree brand.</li>
            <li> not the greatest but is ok</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stink, and the girls say I smell nice.  Do you need anything else?  Fine, I wear a suit to work and spend most of my time outside...it keeps me dry almost as well as the &#x27;clinical&#x27; stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes sure I only smell slightly gross!  But seriously.  I have tried multiple different deodorants in my 40 years.  So far this is the one I enjoy the most.  Lasts a long time, and I somewhat like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great deal for that many and smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. It fits my expectation and I received a bonus, that was another model of degree deodorant, a clinical deodorant. It is so good.</li>
            <li> Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day keeping you from being sweaty and smelly. The scent is strong enough without being over-powering. I now use this brand and nothing else. However this 4 pack can be found cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts all day, but it&#x27;s flaky. It doesn&#x27;t dry clear and comes off on clothes. It also doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as what I consider average dry time.</li>
            <li> REGRETTABLE purchase!!!! avoid this deodorant like the plague- it not only smells BAD, but the scent will give you headaches!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of buying and happily using Degree for Men Deodorant With Time Release Technology (INTENSE SPORT), I made the horrible mistake of trying out this other Degree (Adrenaline Sport), and all I can say is that of the 4 I purchaed, have not even made it through 1/4 of one b/c the scent is sooooooo BADD!!!!!! Horrible product- learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I will order more Degree in the future. I love this product.  It is good beauty care for men.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Much cheaper than the clinical but almost as much active ingredient.  Plus the scent is good.</li>
            <li> I bought This Deodorant for my Son, and he is extremely satisfied with the results of this product...  Good Job for Degree.</li>
