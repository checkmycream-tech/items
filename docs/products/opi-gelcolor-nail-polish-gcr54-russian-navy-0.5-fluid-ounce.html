            <li>I was so excited to find it in a gelcolor.  </li>
            <li>Bottle had leaked all over envelope, had to clean up bottle and wrap as it was a gift.</li>
            <li>specially with darker colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous navy blue with blue/purple shimmer throughout.</li>
            <li>I have and love this color in their regular polish, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should indulge and buy this in the gel.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years, and the only way I even polish my nails anymore is with the gel polish (whether it be Shellac, Gelish, Gelcolor, etc).</li>
            <li>Nothing shines quite like gel polish and the way it lasts and lasts makes the price difference worth it.</li>
            <li>This goes on opaque in the first coat, has a good flow (not too thin or gloppy), and the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see the red at all unless in bright light and the glitter is the same as the glitter in car paint.</li>

            <li>Such a rich color, did not disappoint!</li>
            <li>This shade of navy is perfect, it isn&#x27;t too dark, and has a slight hint of purple in it.  </li>
            <li>It works OK with another my first OPI gel(light pink), but it doesn&#x27;t work with this item.  </li>

            <li>or if it&#x27;s an issue with this color as a whole.</li>

            <li>arrived quickly and as expected, gel polish matches the regular polish well, requires two coats and is thinner than other polish but looks great.</li>
            <li>Russian Navy Gel Polish is a nice dark navy blue, the color is great, however the polish is a bit thick.</li>
            <li>This color is more of a fall/winter color, but it is a really pretty deep, deep blue.  </li>
            <li>I use an LED lamp and it took longer to cure than light colors (60-90 sec per coat rather than 30 secs), but other than that, it was just fine.</li>

            <li> I love this color blue! It is rather dark, but it has a great shine and it is really the perfect color for me..</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.This O.P.I. color is true and vibrant I love this shade of blue it&#x27;s hard to find..especially in GEL polish..and the bottle is BIG compared to most brands sold on here.with O.P.I.you get the color and size you want</li>
            <li> too thick! i have other OPI gel nail polish and it&#x27;s thinner... maybe it&#x27;s from old stock!!! and the color is bit off!!</li>
            <li> I have searched for the perfect navy blue gel polish EVERYWHERE and I have finally found it! The color is rich and shiny, and stays on great.</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying that I LOVE the color. It&#x27;s a gorgeous navy blue with blue/purple shimmer throughout. Absolutely gorgeous. However, applying this color is a completely different story. I am not a professional but I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years, and the only way I even polish my nails anymore is with the gel polish (whether it be Shellac, Gelish, Gelcolor, etc). This is the only color I&#x27;ve had an issue with. When applying, I get little bubbles that pop open leaving everything beneath exposed. I also have the Gelcolor Cajun Shrimp, and do not have the same issue with the bubbles. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad bottle or if it&#x27;s an issue with this color as a whole.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop wearing this color!!!  It is so incredibly beautiful on and I get compliments all of the time on it!  You can get gelcolor that is a weird consistency but this came perfect!</li>
            <li> Russian Navy Gel Polish is a nice dark navy blue, the color is great, however the polish is a bit thick. With the OPI gel polishes my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.  However, I am always changing my color so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know how to thin gel polish??  I know with regular polish you can add acetone, but I’m not sure that will work with the gel polishes.  Please let me know if you have any insight.</li>
            <li> Bottle had leaked all over envelope, had to clean up bottle and wrap as it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish..</li>
            <li> Love the color and the prompt response when 1st shipment went MIA</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as expected, gel polish matches the regular polish well, requires two coats and is thinner than other polish but looks great.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage. Can be used with Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its a dark dark blue, goes on nice and smoothe. Didn&#x27;t chip or anything. Only need one or two coats.</li>
            <li> This is a great color but I think I would prefer to wear it in the fall/winter.  I will keep it to use then.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware... Russian Navy is so dark it almost looks black. OPI Ink is more of a blue/purple color for a royal blue nail.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite OPI colors.  I am consantly washing my hands at work and can not keep regular nail polish on for more than 1 day.  I was so excited to find it in a gelcolor.  It looks even better as a gel!</li>
            <li> I have and love this color in their regular polish, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should indulge and buy this in the gel. I am so glad I did. Nothing shines quite like gel polish and the way it lasts and lasts makes the price difference worth it.

            <li> 04/11/2014 added&lt;br /&gt;I kind of failed to use below &#x27;MelodySusie Pro...&#x27; LED lamp for my this gel, so purchased another gel LED lamp which is much expensive... anyway, it works much better than earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like to leave a comment here to correct below, I would say that the problem comes from LED lamp rather than this nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m happy with this polish, and raise the rate again :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using \\&quot;MelodySusie Pro 12W 12 Watts LED UV Gel Lamp(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009VD3IHO/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)\\&quot; which I bought here Amazon.  It works OK with another my first OPI gel(light pink), but it doesn&#x27;t work with this item.  I cured more than 5-7 minutes but it&#x27;s not dried properly whereas another my light pink OPI gel&#x27;s dried in a minute using same lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m very beginner at using gel nail polish, I&#x27;m not sure where the problems are.  Since the lamp works OK with another OPI, I suspect this item has problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any clue,, please help me !!!.</li>
            <li> This polish has definitely been watered down. It does not have the quality of other opi gel polishes that I have ordered and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ones of my favorite colors - dark but definitely blue.  Especially pretty in the sunlight.  Wore for 2 weeks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> This color is more of a fall/winter color, but it is a really pretty deep, deep blue.  I received many compliments!</li>
            <li> LOVE this color and was so excited to see it in gel!  Such a rich color, did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> i like the color a lot. The nail polish is a little thinner than other gel nail polish I have tried but it is easy to use. It seems to take longer to dry under the uv lights.</li>
            <li> This shade of navy is perfect, it isn&#x27;t too dark, and has a slight hint of purple in it.  It looks like navy, unlike other shades which are so dark that they appear black.  I would definitely recommend this color, its perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great dark navy with red glitter. You can&#x27;t see the red at all unless in bright light and the glitter is the same as the glitter in car paint. It just makes your nails sparkle without looking like you have glitter in your nail polish. I use an LED lamp and it took longer to cure than light colors (60-90 sec per coat rather than 30 secs), but other than that, it was just fine.</li>
            <li> Am a Nail tech and I love this color specially if I want to add designs or shimmer  just be careful applying the first coat  have to be thin :)  good luck. or just let a professional help you. specially with darker colors you don&#x27;t want to touch the skin  once is cure is nothing you can do:)</li>
