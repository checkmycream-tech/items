            <li>It is so cute</li>
            <li>My wife love</li>
            <li>Love this perfume however the formula has changed.</li>
            <li>The lotion is so strong.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>I love it exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>She loves Red Door &amp; loved this set.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did find the real, older item, also on Amazon.</li>

            <li>much so ordering on line was terrific.  </li>
            <li>The new Red Door, in a squared-off bottle, is the new scent.</li>
            <li>To those who find the Red Door perfume unlike previously purchased ones: there is indeed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>There are actually two new scents.</li>
            <li>And give Red Door a ring that you don&#x27;t appreciate such a change in scent if they do not clearly mark it as a new product!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t settle for dinky little bottles and tubes of product...go large.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my mother because she&#x27;s always loved this scent. It was delivered on its final estimated delivery date, which made me slightly nervous (so if you are on a tight schedule, order ahead to avoid the extra costs of faster shipping). When it did arrive, it arrived in perfect condition. Meaning: No cracks or half-empty bottles. The box containing the lotions/perfumes was kept safe in a larger box filled with packing peanuts so the chances of the goods being damaged were very slim.   I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys to smell good and/or like my mother.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments on the scent.   Received it in record time, and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My mother loves Red Door so I got her this set for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She loves it and it was a great deal!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves Red Door &amp; loved this set. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift, and it was definitely a value for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the powder so I ordered the set.  The lotion is so strong.  After washing my hands a few times you can still smell it.  The perfume is way too strong.  I do not like it.  Still love the powder!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a Chrismas gift for someone else but it appears to be all that I had expected.  This item will be enjoyed by the user.</li>
            <li> I love Red Door! This is my favorite perfume... but the one I purchased smelled old and a bit off in color.</li>
            <li> Actually, my friend loves this fragrance. I bought it for her as a holiday gift. I know she&#x27;s enjoying her gift.</li>
            <li> If your lady loves Red Door, she&#x27;ll love this large assortment of Red Door products. Don&#x27;t settle for dinky little bottles and tubes of product...go large. Definite winner!</li>
            <li> I purchase Red Door for my wife every 3 months, well I buy for myself because the fragrance is just so sexy on her</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used red door for years and for some reason this doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as what I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> To those who find the Red Door perfume unlike previously purchased ones: there is indeed a huge difference. The new Red Door, in a squared-off bottle, is the new scent. There are actually two new scents. It has an after-smell like caramel, mixed with something else. I am a Red Door lover, for a very long time, and was angry when I was sent this new product while the picture on Amazon showed the old collection. Fortunately I did find the real, older item, also on Amazon. Be careful to look at the date with the advertisement. Get the older one and you&#x27;ll receive what you asked for. And give Red Door a ring that you don&#x27;t appreciate such a change in scent if they do not clearly mark it as a new product!</li>
            <li> I love it exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I shipped this to my mom for her birthday.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Red Door for my mother for Christmas for years.  I am not able to get out much so ordering on line was terrific.  I hope the product stays the same price.</li>
            <li> This set is great my wife likes it a lot. she get fascinated with this gift. It is so cute</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as the best deal one can ever get and it is  a genuine product too u can wear.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to others and intend to buy again at the end of this year.&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;  Jair</li>
            <li> Perfect, my wife. Loved it. Great price.</li>
            <li> I want to say, it was great. The product and the shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume however the formula has changed. NOT as good a before. Great shipper.</li>
