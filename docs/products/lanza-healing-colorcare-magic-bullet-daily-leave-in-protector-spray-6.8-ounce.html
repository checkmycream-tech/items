            <li> I love, love, love this product, my hair is violet right now, prior to that it was a red orange this product maintains the color, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or flakes!! I was introduce to this spray at the hair salon (3oz for 30) and I was extremely happy that I found it here for $12 on a 6oz bottle! I was a little skeptical that it was going to be a fake but it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m back buying another one, they ship it with care, if you have a color that&#x27;s hard to maintain, this product definitely helps!</li>

            <li> I am a huge Lanza fan.  I love all their products and think they are exceptional.  This product is great, it protects and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair in great condition.  I took a star off for the smell, I&#x27;m just not a fan.  The rest of the products in the Colorcare line have a great scent, this one just doesn&#x27;t sit well with me personally, but the product itself is fabulous.</li>
