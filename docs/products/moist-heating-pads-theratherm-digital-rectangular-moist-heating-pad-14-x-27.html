            <li>and I gave mine to her because she loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT pay the huge price for a TheraTherm which DOESN&#x27;T LAST and doesn&#x27;t have nearly as good features!</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered a replacement!</li>
            <li>I used the cheap drug store heating pad for 6 years before it started giving me problems</li>
            <li>They have backlit LCD displays, which means we no longer have to get up and turn on a light to see the settings as with the TheraTherm.</li>
            <li>The digital control has been great to set the temp and time before shutoff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also happy with the bigger size.</li>
            <li>It was more than I wanted to spend, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>no comparison to cheap heating pads.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you get the right one for you.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough for sure (hotter than I could stand it at full throttle), the timer is great, the size is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I borrowed one similar to this and loved it so much I bought my own.  </li>
            <li>ok sometimes it takes a bet to get hot</li>
            <li>I love the large size.</li>
            <li>It is very discouraging to search for an item and to read many conflicting reviews.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewers who mention backlighting on the control would be nice, but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about how this product helped relieve my back pain.  </li>
            <li>and I would use these to warm up my clients back or feet.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s the only kind I want to have at home.</li>
            <li>Honestly i miss the box of my heating pads I received it open without box</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>this is the kind the use in medical facilities.  </li>
            <li>I like the old control panel better but the new one works fine also.</li>
            <li>The units also have constant and even heat, unlike the TheraTherm which gets very hot and then very cool, etc.</li>
            <li>I was very gentle with and it&#x27;s never been exposed to water.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, buyers should be aware that the MINIMUM heating temp for this is 113 degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s too hot to bear...</li>
            <li>We ordered two more units, thinking it was just an anomaly that our two went out, and now, just 18 months later, the controls on both of them have gone out, and we are out a lot of money on these four units, all identical.    </li>
            <li>Since, I have done a lot more research online, and have just ordered two units of a different brand.</li>
            <li>fact i had to buy another for the first</li>
            <li>It is SO much easier and just as effective as the conventional slow-cooker-lots-of-messy water way.  </li>
            <li>However, the heating pad itself is pure garbage.</li>
            <li>Accurate 2 mode digital control-heat temp and time up to 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Absolutely read the manual.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!    </li>
            <li>It looks very well made.</li>
            <li>too much stress on the cable.</li>
            <li>I really like the display with timer  and temperature controls.</li>
            <li>The moist heat helps so much.  </li>
            <li>Timer and setting device is very dependable.</li>
            <li>searching on the net I found this item available.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for a pulled muscle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Because the pad is big and hefty, it is nice to have help with positioning on the back.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago, we discovered TheraTherm heating pads and liked the features we read about, so ordered two units, even though we were hesitant about the high price.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had intermittent lower back pain that is releived with heat, and it feels so good to lay down with this pad and let it work</li>
            <li>well, I normally would not spend this much for a heating pad.  </li>
            <li>My husband has a wet heat sunbeam 740 model but it barely gets hot, I wanted something better.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I like the appropriate heavy feel.    </li>
            <li>, I take it all back - it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I think the high [can be scalding]temperature  on the Thermphore is too high for anyone to use without professional supervision.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll review the new units, once I receive them.    </li>
            <li>She says she cannot live without it now</li>
            <li>So, while I am unhappy with the vendor of this item, SportingDoc, I am more than satisfied with the manufacturer (DJO - Chattanooga Group).</li>
            <li>Works great, gives multiple options such as timer settings, temperature settings and is big enough to completely cover both legs (to soothe aching thighs) and back.</li>
            <li>I would not advise buying one due to the many people who&#x27;ve had these same electrical issues.</li>
            <li>this moist heat pad Does not get hot enough!</li>
            <li>i never use the ordinary ones any more.  </li>
            <li>large size is too big for my needs</li>
            <li>It has a soft, though sturdy, flannel feel.</li>
            <li>It is an unexpected feature.</li>
            <li>We have an old Sunbeam heating pad and the difference would be something like going from driving a Hyundai to driving a Mercedes.  </li>
            <li>that shorts itself out frequently.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until it suddenly began displaying an E3 error message and shutting down after 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>A classic .Holding up as well as the Thermophore by Battle Creek in our commercial setting</li>
            <li>This is an item I can never be without, and this particular brand is the only one I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>Finally a heating pad that gets hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Yep, I was warmed by other reviews that this unit is either wonderful or an unpleasant device</li>
            <li>This pad is large enough to cover your back but can be scrunched somewhat to use in the neck area where I needed it.</li>
            <li>These new units have 12&#x27; cords, instead of the short TheraTherm cords.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money (assuming it lasts a long long time)</li>
            <li>This is by far a Godsend when your back is aching!</li>
            <li>I was in a major car accident resulting in multiple spinal injuries.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a deep moist heat that really does penetrate down into the aches and pains of the muscles.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I like the appropriate heavy feel.    </li>
            <li> , I take it all back - it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I think the high [can be scalding]temperature  on the Thermphore is too high for anyone to use without professional supervision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review the new units, once I receive them.    </li>
            <li> She says she cannot live without it now</li>
            <li> So, while I am unhappy with the vendor of this item, SportingDoc, I am more than satisfied with the manufacturer (DJO - Chattanooga Group).</li>
            <li> Works great, gives multiple options such as timer settings, temperature settings and is big enough to completely cover both legs (to soothe aching thighs) and back.</li>
            <li> I would not advise buying one due to the many people who&#x27;ve had these same electrical issues.</li>
            <li> this moist heat pad Does not get hot enough!</li>
            <li> i never use the ordinary ones any more.  </li>
            <li> large size is too big for my needs</li>
            <li> It has a soft, though sturdy, flannel feel.</li>
            <li> It is an unexpected feature.</li>
            <li> We have an old Sunbeam heating pad and the difference would be something like going from driving a Hyundai to driving a Mercedes.  </li>
            <li> that shorts itself out frequently.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until it suddenly began displaying an E3 error message and shutting down after 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> A classic .Holding up as well as the Thermophore by Battle Creek in our commercial setting</li>
            <li> This is an item I can never be without, and this particular brand is the only one I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Finally a heating pad that gets hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Yep, I was warmed by other reviews that this unit is either wonderful or an unpleasant device</li>
            <li> This pad is large enough to cover your back but can be scrunched somewhat to use in the neck area where I needed it.</li>
            <li> These new units have 12&#x27; cords, instead of the short TheraTherm cords.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money (assuming it lasts a long long time)</li>
            <li> This is by far a Godsend when your back is aching!</li>
            <li> I was in a major car accident resulting in multiple spinal injuries.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a deep moist heat that really does penetrate down into the aches and pains of the muscles.  </li>
            <li> also like the fact that it&#x27;s xtra long so that it covers a larger area especially for my</li>
            <li> BUT.............................It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a long lifetime.  </li>
            <li> Product just last as expected</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed because when it worked a for a few minutes it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> My first one failed as described above and the company sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> I read the specifications and reviews on Amazon and brand site carefully.  </li>
            <li> long lasting, cotton cover is thick and durable.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of the same heating pads over the past 7 years</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical about spending this much on a heating pad.  </li>
            <li> It also failed to attain the temperature showed on the control, barely getting above body temperature.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fathom using a manual switch where I had to hold down a button all the time</li>
            <li> PLUS, they are less than half the price of the TheraTherm.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead using a heating pad uses it because it works so well.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed that this heating pad lasted exactly two months and two days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best heating pads. I used to be a massage therapist and I would use these to warm up my clients back or feet. Now it&#x27;s the only kind I want to have at home. Has a nice weight to it and the moist heat feels wonderful. I like the old control panel better but the new one works fine also.</li>
            <li> I have a myriad of back issues. Last year I had 3 facet blocks. Icing does not work for me, perhaps because my muscles tense even more to cold. I was going to purchase the Thermophore, which a PT had used on me and recommended. I read the specifications and reviews on Amazon and brand site carefully.  However,I opted for the Thermatherm, after similar research because of the its temperature control and timer options. I have had it for close to 3 months and  use it often. I think the high [can be scalding]temperature  on the Thermphore is too high for anyone to use without professional supervision. I love the timer option of the Thermatherm. If I dose off, I know it will go off automatically...or I can use the manual setting and keep it on.    Absolutely read the manual. Do not be put off by the instructions. In the end, the controls, once you read the manual, are simple and intuitive.      The dimensions are as generous as the largest Thermophore.It extends from my shoulders to the top of my thighs. The cover is removable and washable. It has a soft, though sturdy, flannel feel. The weight relaxes me. It is an unexpected feature. I like the appropriate heavy feel.    The Thermatherm is one of the best purchases I have made. I realized that since I began using, I have been able to self-treat successfully, and decided it warranted a most positive review and endorsement.</li>
            <li> This is the best heating pad ever!  I never believed that moisture could be drawn from the air and be so soothing to your back.  This is by far a Godsend when your back is aching!</li>
            <li> A classic .Holding up as well as the Thermophore by Battle Creek in our commercial setting and we like the adjustable tempertaure.</li>
            <li> Love these. Recommend to all my clients.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about spending this much on a heating pad.  I mean, how good can it really be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I take it all back - it was worth every penny.  We have an old Sunbeam heating pad and the difference would be something like going from driving a Hyundai to driving a Mercedes.  It gives out incredible heat.  And it&#x27;s a deep moist heat that really does penetrate down into the aches and pains of the muscles.  Even my husband who wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead using a heating pad uses it because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it&#x27;s xtra long so that it covers a larger area especially for my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note:  we looked at several different models and decided on this one because we wanted one with a timer and temperature control.  I couldn&#x27;t fathom using a manual switch where I had to hold down a button all the time otherwise the pad goes off.  That would be really irritating so make sure you get the right one for you.</li>
            <li> (Amazon Verified Purchase)    I have had 2 of the same heating pads over the past 7 years and I must say that I have not found anything that can match the quality of pain relief as the \\&quot;Theratherm Digital Moist Heating Pad\\&quot;.   I was in a major car accident resulting in multiple spinal injuries.  The moist heat deeply reaches and provides temporary pain relief.  I highly recommend it!    Thanks, Amazon, for the wonderful customer service always provided!  Charlotte/Mico, Texas</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I wished I had a heating pad.  I borrowed one similar to this and loved it so much I bought my own.  This pad is large enough to cover your back but can be scrunched somewhat to use in the neck area where I needed it. It looks very well made.</li>
            <li> Honestly i miss the box of my heating pads I received it open without box</li>
            <li> We love being able to adjust the heat and timer.  Because the pad is big and hefty, it is nice to have help with positioning on the back.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Having trouble regulating the heat, it does what it wants</li>
            <li> Yep, I was warmed by other reviews that this unit is either wonderful or an unpleasant device that shorts itself out frequently. I was very very disappointed because when it worked a for a few minutes it was wonderful. I would not advise buying one due to the many people who&#x27;ve had these same electrical issues. I had the same problem and it was a little scary hearing this thing popping and hissing. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Best replacement yet, love it</li>
            <li> best around. we have a few of them. Would be great if they could secure better where the ac wire goes into the pad itself. too much stress on the cable.</li>
            <li> Moist heating pad functions good but the cord started coming away from the control box after a few months. I feel it is poorly made and is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this pad in my Massage Therapy practice to heat stones for stone massage.  It is SO much easier and just as effective as the conventional slow-cooker-lots-of-messy water way.  I can also use it on the client to promote relaxation.  Great product, and really quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have osteoathritis of the lumbar spine.  The moist heating pad is very effective in relieving some of the discomfort.  It heats very quickly and is very easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> They work great. I&#x27;ve had one for at lest 6 years now and still working ok sometimes it takes a bet to get hot so I figured I get a back up in case this one ever died</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. Works great, gives multiple options such as timer settings, temperature settings and is big enough to completely cover both legs (to soothe aching thighs) and back.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it!  Obviously, that makes it five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, buyers should be aware that the MINIMUM heating temp for this is 113 degrees Fahrenheit.  For me, that&#x27;s too hot to bear...I prefer a heating pad that can &amp;#34;cook&amp;#34; at about 102 to 106 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is well-made, has a good controller and heats up quickly.  Wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it works just great!  I watch tv while I apply the heating pad and I get great relief.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this heating pad, it has continuously indicated an error symbol after warming up and even after resetting the pad.  Total dissatisfaction with this product, will never reorder nor recommend this item for purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 7 months and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I used the cheap drug store heating pad for 6 years before it started giving me problems - figured since this one is suppose to be better quality I would get at least a few years out of it.. nope.</li>
            <li> Being that my husband and I both suffer from osteoarthritis and low back pain, we are regular users of heating pads. A few years ago, we discovered TheraTherm heating pads and liked the features we read about, so ordered two units, even though we were hesitant about the high price.    Within two years, the controls on both units went out, and of course, were out of warranty by then. We ordered two more units, thinking it was just an anomaly that our two went out, and now, just 18 months later, the controls on both of them have gone out, and we are out a lot of money on these four units, all identical.    Since, I have done a lot more research online, and have just ordered two units of a different brand. These new units have 12&#x27; cords, instead of the short TheraTherm cords. They have backlit LCD displays, which means we no longer have to get up and turn on a light to see the settings as with the TheraTherm. One can also control whether you want &#x27;continuous on&#x27; or &#x27;auto shut off&#x27; mode; not so with TheraTherm units. PLUS, they are less than half the price of the TheraTherm. AND, they can even be washed in the washing machine. The units also have constant and even heat, unlike the TheraTherm which gets very hot and then very cool, etc. I&#x27;ll review the new units, once I receive them.    My advice...do more research and locate what I did.  I found them on Amazon. Search under Sunbeam.  Do NOT pay the huge price for a TheraTherm which DOESN&#x27;T LAST and doesn&#x27;t have nearly as good features!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this thermaphore.  I really like the display with timer  and temperature controls.</li>
            <li> This is the best heating pad ever.  I use it every day for severe back pain, and I have used it for years!  In fact, I introduced my son to this product and he as at least 2 in the house at any given moment.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful heating pad. It was recommended by a pain doctor that moist heat was the best to use on&lt;br /&gt;my lumbar pain. The digital control has been great to set the temp and time before shutoff. Has worked perfectly for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and good delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great heating pad, not like the drug store variety. I would recommend this heating pad to everyone. And it is a nice size</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and the controls are easy to use</li>
            <li> Great thermal product!</li>
            <li> By far the best heating pad ever! This is an item I can never be without, and this particular brand is the only one I will ever buy. If you&#x27;re looking for a good heating pad you can stop now. you just found it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;ve had intermittent lower back pain that is releived with heat, and it feels so good to lay down with this pad and let it work it&#x27;s magic. I&#x27;m also happy with the bigger size.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this heating pad lasted exactly two months and two days. It worked fine until it suddenly began displaying an E3 error message and shutting down after 5 minutes or so. I will see if I can contact the manufacturer for a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2 September 2014: I contacted the manufacturer, Chattanooga Group, and reported my issue. They responded on the next business day and promised to ship me a replacement. So, while I am unhappy with the vendor of this item, SportingDoc, I am more than satisfied with the manufacturer (DJO - Chattanooga Group). They do honor their warranty. I just hope this replacement lasts longer. In the meantime, I am upgrading my rating to 3-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 23 September 2014: The manufacturer (DJO - Chattanooga Group) is VERY good at replacing defective items. I give them 5-stars for that. However, the heating pad itself is pure garbage. My first one failed as described above and the company sent a replacement. It failed within a day or two, again with the E3 error message. It also failed to attain the temperature showed on the control, barely getting above body temperature. The company sent yet a third heating pad but it didn&#x27;t even last one day. It worked for a half hour or so and then failed with the E3 message. I am giving up on this item and downgrading it to 1-star.</li>
            <li> this moist heat pad Does not get hot enough! I think i&#x27;ll go back to the Thermafore!</li>
            <li> It is very discouraging to search for an item and to read many conflicting reviews. Heating pads must be a leader in this regard, as there is not one that does not have negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;We bought our TheraTherm several years ago. It has not been used extensively, just on an as-needed basis. Perhaps because of this, our product works well.&lt;br /&gt;The large size is too big for my needs-I think I will get a smaller one for my knee. But, it is flexible and I can just drape it over my joint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are the good things about it: well made with washable cover. Accurate 2 mode digital control-heat temp and time up to 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;What needs improvement: longer cord between control and pad; backlit LCD controller; and made in America and not Taiwan.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It says not to lay on it but I do all the time.  It has great controls.  My sister cried when I mailed her one.  She says she cannot live without it now and they did not have the money to get one.</li>
            <li> This is the best heating pad a person could buy. I have recommended it to all my friends.  I love the large size. I use it on my knees as well as my back when it brothers me.  The moist heat helps so much.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best heating pad ever.....it works wonders! Easy to wash outer cover and never fear getting burned! Timer and setting device is very dependable.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from neck pain. searching on the net I found this item available. I gave her this present. She loved it. it has temp control.&lt;br /&gt;in fact i had to buy another for the first went to her father who also has problems in the chest during winter. buy it, it worths the price.</li>
            <li> Simply: It&#x27;s the best,</li>
            <li> Finally a heating pad that gets hot enough.  It was more than I wanted to spend, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I cannot do without this heat pad in the winter when my back ache flares up.  My sister came to visit and I gave mine to her because she loved it so much.  I quickly ordered a replacement!</li>
            <li> Best heating pad ever. Well constructed and best of all has an input module like a smartphone on which you create time and temperature for its use.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> perfect, just what i wanted</li>
            <li> Excellent!  One of my all-time values in return to value expended.  I recommend this product to all who desire soothing heat.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for a pulled muscle. Size is great. It covers the entire area of the pain. If I could improve the product, I would add a velcro-on cover. I had to make my own cover.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this heating pad over and over again.  It is one of the best that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> no comparison to cheap heating pads.  this is the kind the use in medical facilities.  pulls dampness out of the air, and moistens your body with adjustable heat temperatures.  i never use the ordinary ones any more.  long lasting, cotton cover is thick and durable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it BUT.............................It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a long lifetime.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few in the past few years for&lt;br /&gt;myself.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product just last as expected</li>
            <li> well, I normally would not spend this much for a heating pad.  but given the acute lower back pain I was experiencing while desperately searching on line to replace my ancient and refusing to work heating pad, well, I was desperate for relief.  My husband has a wet heat sunbeam 740 model but it barely gets hot, I wanted something better.  This is it folks!  it is AWESOME.  the moist heat is so much more penetrating than my beloved ancient heating pad (R.I.P.)  and the efficiency of this Thera Therm compared to the Sunbeam 740 is like night and day.  It gets hot enough for sure (hotter than I could stand it at full throttle), the timer is great, the size is fabulous.  It heats up quickly and does the job.  I agree with the reviewers who mention backlighting on the control would be nice, but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about how this product helped relieve my back pain.  It is definitely worth the money (assuming it lasts a long long time)</li>
            <li> This heating pad feels great BUT unfortunately just after I posted my review it stopped working. I was very gentle with and it&#x27;s never been exposed to water. I&#x27;m attempting to return it under the warranty and hope they honor their products.</li>
