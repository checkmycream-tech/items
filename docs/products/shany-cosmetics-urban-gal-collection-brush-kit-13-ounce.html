            <li>I wish it would&#x27;ve had more of a variety</li>
            <li>Glad I opened the box to inspect the product.</li>
            <li>I love this kit for travel and the roll keeps them in one place.  </li>
            <li>it has many brushes.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I was able to split it and share.</li>
            <li>I love the many styles of brushes.</li>
            <li>and I did a pull test on each on and not one hair came out, fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my friend will love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting for better quality of brushes.</li>
            <li>The case does not look as cute as seen on photo.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought it would work out OK for my needs.</li>
            <li>Now I have more brushes and I STILL need a case.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of brushes from this set that I like and use, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t use them and wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered them.</li>
            <li>I love the selection of brushes that come with the brush holder.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes love the case.</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t bought any brushes from Shany, I am thinking of buying some, and if I do, I will get these brushes for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they&#x27;re vegan.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in a structured case as well</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think the Urban Gal Collection Brush Kit is awesome.</li>
            <li>but I just bent the metal more to hold in the bristles...</li>
            <li>If you are a product junkie and makeup snob look elsewhere love.</li>
            <li>These brushes are okay.  </li>
            <li>but I keep it in my purse everyday and added some of my own makeup :D</li>
            <li>2 star for great amazon fast free shipping to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>They are vegan which is important to me, also love the carry case</li>
            <li>I just love this idea I can carry all of my brushes and they are easy to use when I need them and can fit this case anywhere.</li>
            <li>the brushes are really soft yet sturdy and they don&#x27;t break, their amazing!</li>
            <li>but I washed them and they were fine</li>
            <li>and the little pouch is so convenient to carry around in your purse or bag, i want to get one for my best friend as a gift!</li>
            <li>The zipper case is cheaply made and looks like a cheap water bottle holder.</li>
            <li>They carrying case is nice although I am really unsure why there are clips on either side?</li>
            <li>Easy  to clean.</li>
            <li>brushes were very useful; it kept it organized in there</li>
            <li>They wash very well and are very strong.  </li>
            <li>The brushes feel amazing and they seem like a high name brand made them.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s vegan, travel sized, &amp; it comes with the carry on case, making it soo much easier to keep them all in one place, and stay organized!</li>
            <li>They have the nicest brushes ever, I have a different set with more and it is amazing for applying eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I am germophobic and clean my brushes often</li>
            <li>but these brushes are amazing and VERY soft.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special, per se.  </li>
            <li>good amount of brushes, and every brush can be used in your daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>The brushes were very well packed with air bags all around it which pleased me.</li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonably quick, I ordered the brushes on Sunday and they arrived at my house Friday afternoon.</li>
            <li>more than one brush in this gives me the ability to work with darker shades and more lighter ones at the same time</li>
            <li>I pursue makeup in my free time, so a professional set that didn&#x27;t break the bank was a necessity for me -- and these brushes totally fit the bill!</li>
            <li>so many brushes needs to come with what each brush is for but it is very useful as far as travelling</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Bought this bec of the good reviews, wasted my money should have save a little more and invest to a good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes looked the same, and perhaps would be great detail brushes but would not offer a wide variety.</li>
            <li>I love soft brushes</li>
            <li>I liked them well enough, but</li>
            <li>A great small kit to travel with.</li>
            <li>This was a perfect little brush kit&lt;br /&gt;Everything fith into this comsmetic urban gal bag&lt;</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really secure and it has little bits on the sides where you can attach a shoulder strap which is really handy.</li>
            <li>All the brushes are very modern looking</li>
            <li>these brushes are very high quality for being vegan!</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Like it so much!</li>
            <li>and the case has enough room to add a couple more brushes if you want to.</li>
            <li>and it comes in a unique case that is small and very easy to just stick in your suit case.</li>
            <li>the brushes are full and they are soft on my skin  </li>
            <li>I know that the right brushes are the key to attaining the right looks, and the right style and beauty, especially when it comes to accentuating one&#x27;s own features of natural beauty.</li>
            <li>I eagerly opened the box and unzipped the travel bag that the brushes came in, which seems very well made and durable by the way, and the brushes inside had slip on plastic covers on to protect the hairs.</li>
            <li>actually really like the brushes.</li>
            <li>The quality is much better than I expected</li>
            <li>I think this is an absolute must have for today&#x27;s woman.</li>
            <li>You definitely get what you pay for, the quality of brushes synthetic hair is soft, and is great to use with everything minus mineral makeup for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s OK for start up, but for professional</li>
            <li>Very soft, good quality and don&#x27;t shed excessively.</li>
            <li>I have actually found better quality brushes at Costco or the Dollar General.</li>
            <li>you need this for the case, there are other options on Amazon, one other one has a great review</li>
            <li>The handy little zip-up bag is a plus!</li>
            <li>but I still love the brush set none the less.</li>
            <li>The main thing I wanted was the case, the brushes were an added</li>
            <li>a total of 15 brushes and a case for only 25$ ! pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Lots of variety of brush size, came extremely fast, and arrived in good condition ( a few minor nicks here and there).</li>
            <li>Other than that the quality of the brushes is actually quite amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I usually have a hard time but this is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please at how soft these brushes are</li>
            <li>I like the new look of the case.</li>
            <li>If you are a new make up artist</li>
            <li>but they are very soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed one of the larger brushes it fell apart.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and new to putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>Super modern looking, not the same old pink stuff you see all the time.</li>
            <li>I love that these brushes are vegan, so at least you can have a clear mind that these do not contain anything animal in them.</li>
            <li>on to the brushes, They are so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>Could be fixed, but it was a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li>specially the small ones for my eyes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>But at least I got a few brush styles I did not already own.</li>
            <li>I notice that sometimes with my brush roll, a few of my brushes can become misshapen, so I like the container very very much.</li>
            <li>the brushes were more synthetic and stiff and i prefer fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that many of them are repeats and that its really not &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about these brushes, haven&#x27;t really use them</li>
            <li>the brushes are very soft like other shany brushes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was expecting for better quality of brushes.</li>
            <li> The case does not look as cute as seen on photo.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it would work out OK for my needs.</li>
            <li> Now I have more brushes and I STILL need a case.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of brushes from this set that I like and use, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t use them and wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered them.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of brushes that come with the brush holder.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes love the case.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t bought any brushes from Shany, I am thinking of buying some, and if I do, I will get these brushes for sure.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they&#x27;re vegan.</li>
            <li> I love that they come in a structured case as well</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think the Urban Gal Collection Brush Kit is awesome.</li>
            <li> but I just bent the metal more to hold in the bristles...</li>
            <li> If you are a product junkie and makeup snob look elsewhere love.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay.  </li>
            <li> but I keep it in my purse everyday and added some of my own makeup :D</li>
            <li> 2 star for great amazon fast free shipping to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> They are vegan which is important to me, also love the carry case</li>
            <li> I just love this idea I can carry all of my brushes and they are easy to use when I need them and can fit this case anywhere.</li>
            <li> the brushes are really soft yet sturdy and they don&#x27;t break, their amazing!</li>
            <li> but I washed them and they were fine</li>
            <li> and the little pouch is so convenient to carry around in your purse or bag, i want to get one for my best friend as a gift!</li>
            <li> The zipper case is cheaply made and looks like a cheap water bottle holder.</li>
            <li> They carrying case is nice although I am really unsure why there are clips on either side?</li>
            <li> Easy  to clean.</li>
            <li> brushes were very useful; it kept it organized in there</li>
            <li> They wash very well and are very strong.  </li>
            <li> The brushes feel amazing and they seem like a high name brand made them.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s vegan, travel sized, &amp; it comes with the carry on case, making it soo much easier to keep them all in one place, and stay organized!</li>
            <li> They have the nicest brushes ever, I have a different set with more and it is amazing for applying eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I am germophobic and clean my brushes often</li>
            <li> but these brushes are amazing and VERY soft.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special, per se.  </li>
            <li> good amount of brushes, and every brush can be used in your daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very well packed with air bags all around it which pleased me.</li>
            <li> The shipping was reasonably quick, I ordered the brushes on Sunday and they arrived at my house Friday afternoon.</li>
            <li> more than one brush in this gives me the ability to work with darker shades and more lighter ones at the same time</li>
            <li> I pursue makeup in my free time, so a professional set that didn&#x27;t break the bank was a necessity for me -- and these brushes totally fit the bill!</li>
            <li> so many brushes needs to come with what each brush is for but it is very useful as far as travelling</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought this bec of the good reviews, wasted my money should have save a little more and invest to a good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes looked the same, and perhaps would be great detail brushes but would not offer a wide variety.</li>
            <li> I love soft brushes</li>
            <li> I liked them well enough, but</li>
            <li> A great small kit to travel with.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect little brush kit&lt;br /&gt;Everything fith into this comsmetic urban gal bag&lt;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really secure and it has little bits on the sides where you can attach a shoulder strap which is really handy.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are very modern looking</li>
            <li> these brushes are very high quality for being vegan!</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Like it so much!</li>
            <li> and the case has enough room to add a couple more brushes if you want to.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a unique case that is small and very easy to just stick in your suit case.</li>
            <li> the brushes are full and they are soft on my skin  </li>
            <li> I know that the right brushes are the key to attaining the right looks, and the right style and beauty, especially when it comes to accentuating one&#x27;s own features of natural beauty.</li>
            <li> I eagerly opened the box and unzipped the travel bag that the brushes came in, which seems very well made and durable by the way, and the brushes inside had slip on plastic covers on to protect the hairs.</li>
            <li> actually really like the brushes.</li>
            <li> The quality is much better than I expected</li>
            <li> I think this is an absolute must have for today&#x27;s woman.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for, the quality of brushes synthetic hair is soft, and is great to use with everything minus mineral makeup for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s OK for start up, but for professional</li>
            <li> Very soft, good quality and don&#x27;t shed excessively.</li>
            <li> I have actually found better quality brushes at Costco or the Dollar General.</li>
            <li> you need this for the case, there are other options on Amazon, one other one has a great review</li>
            <li> The handy little zip-up bag is a plus!</li>
            <li> but I still love the brush set none the less.</li>
            <li> The main thing I wanted was the case, the brushes were an added</li>
            <li> a total of 15 brushes and a case for only 25$ ! pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety of brush size, came extremely fast, and arrived in good condition ( a few minor nicks here and there).</li>
            <li> Other than that the quality of the brushes is actually quite amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time but this is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please at how soft these brushes are</li>
            <li> I like the new look of the case.</li>
            <li> If you are a new make up artist</li>
            <li> but they are very soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed one of the larger brushes it fell apart.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and new to putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> Super modern looking, not the same old pink stuff you see all the time.</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are vegan, so at least you can have a clear mind that these do not contain anything animal in them.</li>
            <li> on to the brushes, They are so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> Could be fixed, but it was a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li> specially the small ones for my eyes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> But at least I got a few brush styles I did not already own.</li>
            <li> I notice that sometimes with my brush roll, a few of my brushes can become misshapen, so I like the container very very much.</li>
            <li> the brushes were more synthetic and stiff and i prefer fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that many of them are repeats and that its really not &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about these brushes, haven&#x27;t really use them</li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft like other shany brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are natural hair, they hold and spread the makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is great but was a little disappointed to not have gotten a blush brush for the price of the set.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complaint much with the price I paid though.</li>
            <li> Only problem I found with these brushes is that some of them in the packaging came a bit bent so you have to wet them and lay them out on a towel to dry before use.</li>
            <li> I needed something to keep my brushes in and the other one I saw online was almost the same price but came by itself.</li>
            <li> It makes me so sad, little animals shouldn&#x27;t suffer for our beauty :)</li>
            <li> Brushes were not high quality, case not as appears in photo.</li>
            <li> these were not really what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The only trouble is I don&#x27;t know what to do with some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work well</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes, but after one time use the brush part fell off the handle on my foundation one so pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because my friend&#x27;s birthday is coming up in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I do not recommend anyone waste their money with this cheapskate company.</li>
            <li> I have been carrying my brushes in a base that looks like a brush belt and they always fall out and doesnt fit anywhere.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know what the fan shapped brush or the really small brushes are for.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are very small and appear to have very little hair on them.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the low quality of these brushes and even more disappointed with the service.</li>
            <li> Overall if you are a poor cosmetology/esthi student this isnt a bad set...</li>
            <li> artist - brushes are EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> The zipper did not work and there are two bulky clips on both sides of the zippers that make accessing the brushes difficult.</li>
            <li> (Sad, I know.)</li>
            <li> I assumed that they would be falling apart and shedding like crazy</li>
            <li> Would have received 5 stars but the zipper is very difficult to re-attach.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate picking out all my day to day brushes when I pack</li>
            <li> I hate thinking about all the companies who test on animals.</li>
            <li> , I hate that with brush rolls after a while they get misshapen.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a set of vegan brushes forever, but was unwilling to pay the outrageous price tag.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience all around.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Brushes were not high quality, case not as appears in photo. Would not recommend this product if you are looking for a great set of brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushes are so good. the travel case is perfect if you want to carry them around. the quality of the brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great set of brush for what you are paying. The brushes feel amazing and they seem like a high name brand made them. i was very happy with the quality. THe shipping was also great as the product arrived very fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I make my living as a make up artist - brushes are EXPENSIVE and so I look for quality AND a great price  - these are just wonderful - OK the brushes are a professional quality- I cant believe the deal they are - I am going to reorder NOW - 3 of the brushes are similar but who cares the rest are GREAT !!!</li>
            <li> Really good quality brushes for a great price.  The only downside to these brushes are all the eyeliner brushes it comes with.  I wish it would&#x27;ve had more of a variety but I still love the brush set none the less.</li>
            <li> these were not really what i thought it would be. the brushes were more synthetic and stiff and i prefer fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li> This was going to be a gift for my teenager for Christmas. Glad I opened the box to inspect the product. The zipper case is cheaply made and looks like a cheap water bottle holder. The zipper did not work and there are two bulky clips on both sides of the zippers that make accessing the brushes difficult. All of the brushes are very small and appear to have very little hair on them. Most of the brushes looked the same, and perhaps would be great detail brushes but would not offer a wide variety. I am a former make-up artist and wouldn&#x27;t dare use these on a client. I have actually found better quality brushes at Costco or the Dollar General. Don&#x27;t waste your money. There are better brushes out their for $25.00!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes! Very soft, good quality and don&#x27;t shed excessively. They carrying case is nice although I am really unsure why there are clips on either side? I just cut them off since they tend to get in the way of the zipper.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about these brushes, haven&#x27;t really use them but they are very soft. They are at a very good price. So I totally recommend them. Is a bargain.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is great but was a little disappointed to not have gotten a blush brush for the price of the set.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for Shany&#x27;s brushes.  I love this kit for travel and the roll keeps them in one place.  I hate picking out all my day to day brushes when I pack so it&#x27;s nice to keep this one seperate to just grab and go.</li>
            <li> good amount of brushes, and every brush can be used in your daily makeup routine. the brushes are really soft yet sturdy and they don&#x27;t break, their amazing!</li>
            <li> Loved the assortment of brushes and the dual-purpose container - storage and display/use. Would have received 5 stars but the zipper is very difficult to re-attach.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE SOOOO DURABLE AND AFFORDABLE!! YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF FACE, CONCEALER, FOUNDATION, EYES, LIPS, ANGLED, AND FAN BRUSHES!! VERY GOOD QUALITY!! AND GREAT FOR ON THE GO!!! THE CARRY CASE IS GREAT FOR TRAVELING!! IM GOIN TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY MOM!!</li>
            <li> Awesome price! Great product and it has many brushes. My daughter and I was able to split it and share. I love the many styles of brushes. Truly a great deal. The case it comes in is also handy to keep the brushes intact when traveling. It acts as a cup. Thank you for the packaging and they arrived without a dent or scratch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the case and the brushes! Super modern looking, not the same old pink stuff you see all the time. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> This product is really great for traveling. All the brushes are very modern looking and it comes in a unique case that is small and very easy to just stick in your suit case. The price is great for very good quality brushes. Shany cosmetics never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I use almost all of them when I makeup myself, each one of them is so usefull, specially the small ones for my eyes and eyebrows. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> these brushes are very high quality for being vegan! and the little pouch is so convenient to carry around in your purse or bag, i want to get one for my best friend as a gift!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are perfect set for traveling! They have the nicest brushes ever, I have a different set with more and it is amazing for applying eyeshadows. I usually have a hard time but this is great!</li>
            <li> This was a perfect little brush kit&lt;br /&gt;Everything fith into this comsmetic urban gal bag&lt;br /&gt;the brushes were very useful; it kept it organized in there</li>
            <li> these brushes are perfect quality! every size you&#x27;ll ever need! and it&#x27;s also the perfect case to carry these around for traveling (i tend to lose my brushes)</li>
            <li> There vegan brushes and really wonderful to use! Feels nice on the face and eyes I did have alittle shedding in the beginning but I washed them and they were fine no shedding after that!</li>
            <li> very good quality brushes. the brushes are very soft like other shany brushes. I like the new look of the case.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes, but after one time use the brush part fell off the handle on my foundation one so pretty disappointed. Will try to superglue it back on. Nice that it comes with a case and each brush has a protective covering.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a set of vegan brushes forever, but was unwilling to pay the outrageous price tag. Then I found these. Great quality for the money!</li>
            <li> 15 Piece Vegan Travel Brushes for a great price! They are vegan which is important to me, also love the carry case</li>
            <li> this brush kit set and carry on case is great for traveling!! just grab and go! and quality of the brushes is great! couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better from shany!</li>
            <li> If you are a new make up artist this is the best brushes to use. They wash very well and are very strong.  I love soft brushes</li>
            <li> This product is a great travel compact case for your brushes. A must for any beauty freak and so compact.Great style and price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because my friend&#x27;s birthday is coming up in a few weeks and I already bought her an eye shadow pallet so I thought she would need some eyeshadow brushes to go with it. I read a ton of reviews about these brushes and everyone said that they were great so without any hesitation I ordered them. The shipping was reasonably quick, I ordered the brushes on Sunday and they arrived at my house Friday afternoon. The brushes were very well packed with air bags all around it which pleased me. I eagerly opened the box and unzipped the travel bag that the brushes came in, which seems very well made and durable by the way, and the brushes inside had slip on plastic covers on to protect the hairs. I&#x27;m very please at how soft these brushes are and I did a pull test on each on and not one hair came out, fantastic! My only complaint about this brush set is that I wish they would have included a fluffy brush to blend eyeshadow better but that is my only con against this set. Over all I think this brush set is well made and I&#x27;m sure my friend will love it.</li>
            <li> a total of 15 brushes and a case for only 25$ ! pretty cheap. the case makes traveling a lot easier, you dont have to worry about damaging or loosing any brushes.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the low quality of these brushes and even more disappointed with the service. Horrible experience all around. I do not recommend anyone waste their money with this cheapskate company.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were a nice looking set within my price range. I love the case itself! the zipper takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s really secure and it has little bits on the sides where you can attach a shoulder strap which is really handy. The only trouble is I don&#x27;t know what to do with some of the brushes. I&#x27;m 27 years old and new to putting on makeup. (Sad, I know.) So I don&#x27;t know what the fan shapped brush or the really small brushes are for. Despite that, great set and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Like it so much! Very fast delivery! Well packed! Great stuff! Just love it as I&#x27;ve got all I need in one! Also come within a traveling pack.</li>
            <li> I was expecting for better quality of brushes. The case does not look as cute as seen on photo. I can&#x27;t complaint much with the price I paid though. Overall it&#x27;s OK for start up, but for professional or if you are looking for good brushes, this is a \\&quot;No No\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Only problem I found with these brushes is that some of them in the packaging came a bit bent so you have to wet them and lay them out on a towel to dry before use. Other than that they work well and the case has enough room to add a couple more brushes if you want to.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for the carrying case. I needed something to keep my brushes in and the other one I saw online was almost the same price but came by itself. I read the reviews and thought it would work out OK for my needs. The main thing I wanted was the case, the brushes were an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the brushes. The quality is much better than I expected and I look forward to using them - I don&#x27;t see any way I can possibly NEED to use all of them. They are very nice. The case however, created a lot of disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I needed a carrying/traveling case for my brushes. Now I have more brushes and I STILL need a case. Day 2 of using this case the zipper separated and I can&#x27;t get it back together. Now I have a case that has no attached lid, so my brushes still are unprotected when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need this for the case, there are other options on Amazon, one other one has a great review and I&#x27;ll probably have to buy that. I travel a great deal for work and need to keep my brushes organized. So, this case did not work out like I had hoped. But at least I got a few brush styles I did not already own.</li>
            <li> Im impressed   Having more than one brush in this gives me the ability to work with darker shades and more lighter ones at the same time and I dont have to worry about cleaning brushes in between make up..  I am germophobic and clean my brushes often and Ive had no problem with these brushes  the brushes are full and they are soft on my skin  The case keeps everything organized and good for travel but I keep it in my purse everyday and added some of my own makeup :D</li>
            <li> A friend at college has this set for use when doing perfprmances! Its so practical and its now made me want to buy a set for myself. If your unsure whether to get it i promise u wont be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> i love the case it comes in--obviously perfect for travel or for taking on jobs. you can use the case as a brush holder once you get to your destination. i also love that they&#x27;re vegan!</li>
            <li> There are a couple of brushes from this set that I like and use, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t use them and wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered them. They aren&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> The first time I washed one of the larger brushes it fell apart. I like the eye brushes but picture is misleading on the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this bec of the good reviews, wasted my money should have save a little more and invest to a good quality brushes. 2 star for great amazon fast free shipping to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of brushes that come with the brush holder. The only negative is that many of them are repeats and that its really not &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34;. Other than that the quality of the brushes is actually quite amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> so many brushes needs to come with what each brush is for but it is very useful as far as travelling</li>
            <li> Since the price was so low I assumed that they would be falling apart and shedding like crazy but these brushes are amazing and VERY soft.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes love the case. Your brushes will stay in prestine condition with this case. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great for traveling, or keeping in your purse.  The case protects the brushes and keeps them together.  I use brushes for applying my makeup and am lost without them so this set is great to have when I need to touch up or reapply my makeup.  I think this is an absolute must have for today&#x27;s woman. The price is very reasonable.  The brushes are natural hair, they hold and spread the makeup extremely well. Linda W.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to tote your makeup brushes around. The handy little zip-up bag is a plus! And the brushes have synthetic bristles so no allergy to animal hair to worry with. A great small kit to travel with.</li>
            <li> I have been carrying my brushes in a base that looks like a brush belt and they always fall out and doesnt fit anywhere. I just love this idea I can carry all of my brushes and they are easy to use when I need them and can fit this case anywhere. The brushes that this kit comes with are great quality and you get all of this for such a great price!</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t bought any brushes from Shany, I am thinking of buying some, and if I do, I will get these brushes for sure.  I know that the right brushes are the key to attaining the right looks, and the right style and beauty, especially when it comes to accentuating one&#x27;s own features of natural beauty.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these brushes. I love the fact that they&#x27;re vegan. I hate thinking about all the companies who test on animals. It makes me so sad, little animals shouldn&#x27;t suffer for our beauty :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the brushes, They are so soft and dense. They work so well. I love that they come in a structured case as well, I hate that with brush rolls after a while they get misshapen. This case keeps them so nice and safe! I love it.</li>
            <li> Wow! I been looking for vegan brushes! These brushes are very soft and picks up a good amount of product! I really liked it! Comes in a good variety of brushes and best of all, it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes rivals my more expensive sets. The quality is excellent and the set contains any and all brushes you could ever imaging needing!! Def try this set...you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think the Urban Gal Collection Brush Kit is awesome. I love that it&#x27;s vegan, travel sized, &amp; it comes with the carry on case, making it soo much easier to keep them all in one place, and stay organized!</li>
            <li> Some of the best most affordable brushes I&#x27;ve owned so far.  Easy  to clean.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety of brush size, came extremely fast, and arrived in good condition ( a few minor nicks here and there). You definitely get what you pay for, the quality of brushes synthetic hair is soft, and is great to use with everything minus mineral makeup for me. Some of the brushes hair is falling out but I just bent the metal more to hold in the bristles... Overall if you are a poor cosmetology/esthi student this isnt a bad set... If you are a product junkie and makeup snob look elsewhere love.</li>
            <li> This brush case and brush set is amazing.  I use MAC brushes and these brushes are comparable.  The case is great because it can stand on your counter.  Currently, I have 28 brushes stored in the case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay.  I liked them well enough, but the brushes separated from the handles very easily.  Could be fixed, but it was a bit of a pain.  Nothing really special, per se.  The carrying case was nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes have great pickup, are made nicely, and the case is perfect. It has enough room to add the brushes you already have too! I pursue makeup in my free time, so a professional set that didn&#x27;t break the bank was a necessity for me -- and these brushes totally fit the bill! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are vegan, so at least you can have a clear mind that these do not contain anything animal in them. I also like the ease of travel with these. I notice that sometimes with my brush roll, a few of my brushes can become misshapen, so I like the container very very much.</li>
