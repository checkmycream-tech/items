            <li>They do their job effectively.</li>
            <li>Nice and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I liked it and it removed my makeup, but it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li>I have used many makeup wipes but none as good as these.  </li>
            <li>(it honestly feels like I rubbed my face with grease</li>
            <li>To avoid rubbing, i apply my nourishing Boots eye makeup remover with some warm water around the eyes to allow the makeup to loosen, then i wipe everything with the Aveeno.</li>
            <li>They smell nice and the wipes are not overpowering.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for quickly removing face and eye makeup without irritation or a strong smell.</li>
            <li>they clean great.</li>
            <li>I have purchased these for myself many times and have gifted them to friends who have also loved them.</li>
            <li>These wipes are by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of wipes and these are THE BEST!</li>
            <li>The best wipes for eye makeup removal - The only ones of the many I have tried that DO NOT irritate my eyes....  Love them!</li>
            <li>Great for removing makeup or refreshing your face on a hot, steamy day.</li>
            <li>Does a good job except when I am using super goop sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I use them morning and night and love them.</li>
            <li>It also has the snap-close top to help the wipes from drying out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s okay, but I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Better than Neutrogena wipes, in my opinion, and they don&#x27;t sting my face the way that Neutrogena wipes sometimes do.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>These work fabulous and no need to worry about break outs-great wipes!</li>
            <li>Love these cloths.  </li>
            <li>my favorite nightly ritual is removing the debris of the day with these Aveeno pads.</li>
            <li>I have tried many makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li>I use one on my face every night, and most nights, that&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love these wipes - I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more then 25 wipes.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i came here to purchase some more but found the price at drugstore.com to be better</li>
            <li>Love Vernon.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite face wipes.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too.  </li>
            <li>These wipes feel OK</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and soft with a really pleasant scent, but also get rid of all of my makeup and seem to exfoliate too.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great, and if I do use a serum or cream, it seems to be absorbed much more quickly than if I used soap and water to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They smell so good and are really gentle.</li>
            <li>The makeup comes off so easily</li>
            <li>I love the clean scent too.</li>
            <li>Very mild</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels afterwards, clean and silky and not oily.</li>
            <li>Strong perfumes give me headaches.</li>
            <li>this works just fine.</li>
            <li>Very effective in removing make up, leaving soft and clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li>These are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>And the smell is wonderful, very light and delicate like chamomile tea, not</li>
            <li>gentle and effective for eye makeup removal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few and these are the best.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, work very well.</li>
            <li>Gentle, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy around the eyes and leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Light smell is pleasing as well.</li>
            <li>My wife uses these daily and is happy she doesn&#x27;t have to run to the store and can have these in 2 days with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>And good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased these for a trip and liked them so much, now use them at home.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle on sensitive skin and still do a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smells good, and cleans the make up right off!</li>
            <li>They take off all of my make-up, leave my face clean and refreshed, and smelling FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Takes the first step of cleaning my face so much more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken them with me to the beach, the pool, (great for when that mascara runs) and after a long day I just wipe it away!</li>
            <li>the wipes clean well and are soothing - yes I would recommend them.</li>
            <li>I continue to use them, but will always be on the lookout for something better, and maybe finally make my own.</li>
            <li>I leave these by my bed and use them at night which helps my skin stay clean.</li>
            <li>Gets makeup off easily and no crazy smells.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by another reviewer, they are an awesome size, don&#x27;t tear, stretch readily, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, though if I had a complaint I would wish for fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>These do  clean, and if you have sensitive skin, they are kind.</li>
            <li>The wipes are wonderful for at least 2 reasons: 1) after I clean, there&#x27;s no need to moisturize or use anything astringent, and 2) the packaging style allows you to remove the wipe(s) you need and then reclose the package without the remaining wipes drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i can vouche for the gentle part. :)</li>
            <li>The most gentle wipe I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They are soft and pretty good sized.  </li>
            <li>One towelette, which comes perfectly moist, completely cleans off my makeup and mascara without making my face feel dry.  </li>
            <li>Great product but Amazon&#x27;s price was almost twice that of other retailers.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>Simply the best facial wipe.</li>
            <li>And as someone that had blemishes earlier in my life and skin drying issues and all sorts of facial issues - I can say with confidence that these work great for me!</li>
            <li>Super oily and made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li>Super gentle, light moisturizing, but clean well.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite wipes.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>They work the best, especially for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The snap lid isn&#x27;t very good, I had to use multiple wipes to remove all the makeup I had on (and I don&#x27;t even wear much!!), AND it left this greasy film on my fingers and face</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sensitive skin, and these work perfectly for cleansing my skin, and preventing the burn of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;7/ helped me indeed calm the irritation and the redness with time.</li>
            <li>Love these for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I read that some people like the smell, I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>Many times when I use products that say &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;, my skin would still be irritable or would &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; after applying lotion or something to it.</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully, but if you&#x27;re wearing heavy makeup you&#x27;ll probably need 2 to completely get it off.</li>
            <li>I like this even more than my neutrogena wipes because they don&#x27;t burn my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>And I was thrilled that it removes facial and eye make up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other good brands like Neutrogena but their packages have a supposedly re-useable sticky to open/close the package.</li>
            <li>This product gently but fully removes all those products and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  </li>
            <li>The wipes did leave my skin soft, but the smell was so strong that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing them, i had used Blum, Neutrogena, Simple (which i really liked), Garnier, Alba Botanica, and probably several more which i can&#x27;t recall.</li>
            <li>They remove all your make-up, don&#x27;t dry out your skin &amp; smell nice.</li>
            <li>First off,I love Aveeno products in general.</li>
            <li>this is so soft on my face, it does not create any skin irritants and works great with taking off makeup or any other dirt from face.</li>
            <li>Really like how this soothes my face and removes all the makeup and keeps me moisturized before bed!</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews associated with this product on Amazon are reviews for a different Aveeno product.</li>
            <li>i found those at Jewel first because it said \\&quot;ultra calming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li>These make my skin feel wonderfully soft and clean.</li>
            <li>feels clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin clean, fresh and no residue.</li>
            <li>I found it at half the price and ordered several more, love the product itself.  </li>
            <li>The Aveeno make up removing wipes are very soft and large in size as compared to other popular brands.  </li>
            <li>They are so gentle.</li>
            <li>The Aveeno wipes were really cooling and moisturizing. .</li>
            <li>I really like these wipes because they even get off your eye makeup including your mascara.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Anyway, I gave this product (the makeup removing wipes) 5 stars because it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>These wipes are very calming (as it reads on the package).</li>
            <li>Gentle and calming to your face but does the job well.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>and I really like them quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>These are really soothing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>These wipes remove makeup really well, aside from waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>and i am someone who really doesnt like drugstore beauty products</li>
            <li>Very well and without any burning, or irritation.</li>
            <li>Sturdy cloth, gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>but they leave too much of a residue on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even be willing to pay a little more.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite, hands down.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is I&#x27;m glad I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to find an other solution because these Aveeno wipes are the BOMB!</li>
            <li>I like these very much,but I wish they were just a little bit more moist.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them for half the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands and this is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my skin go into over-active itchy mode.</li>
            <li>in fact you can find many of those for just 3.99 at your local Marshalls in the beauty isle, they have different brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a softer feel to Aveeno that is so  much nicer than many of the other brands and the size of the towelette is larger than many other brands.  </li>
            <li>I have itchy, sensitive, very reactive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>These are so gentle and soft and stretchy, not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>its soft and gentle, and leaves a soft feel to your skin!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s and have very sensitive skin with rosacea.  </li>
            <li>They are so very soft and work so well to remove makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am also very sensitive to perfumes and these wipes don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong so after I clean my face with them I take a wet wash cloth and get the residue off.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and yet needed something to remove my &amp;#34;last all day&amp;#34; type foundation, eyeliner!, and lip stain.  </li>
            <li>I very much like Aveeno products to begin with, especially when my skin gets sensitive.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save makes it a bargain and completely effortless.</li>
            <li>For a sensitive skin product, I don&#x27;t know why they added a fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it left my face very greasy as if I just put on a layer of greasy face lotion</li>
            <li>Moist, soft, cleansing.....super price and convenient sending.....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I was looking for a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; wipe to use before washing with my sensitive skin soap.</li>
            <li>They are soft too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>they STRETCH, they dont tear, and they are as soft as silk.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, try those.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin soft and nurtured.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes, gets the makeup off and makes my skin feel soft and soothed.</li>
            <li>You may still want to follow it with a quick cleanse, but in a pinch (long, long day at work &amp; just want it off your face before you crash)</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t normal for me, especially in pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough that 1 wipe does your entire face</li>
            <li>I have tried Simple, Ponds, Oil of Olay and many other make up removing wipe brands only to find my skin seriously itchy, irritated or not feeling clean after using them.</li>
            <li>These actually stay moist to cut up and use again and again... and gentle enough to use on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have extreamly sensitive skin and was worried how my skin would react but not only did I not react to them</li>
            <li>I recently tried a store brand for sensitive skin to save money</li>
            <li>i tried to leave it on a few times, and i felt like a silky gel on my skin for about 5 minutes, but then the skin absorbed it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Aveeno wipes, but my only complaint is ... why make a pack of 25?</li>
            <li>These wipes are serious about taking off eye makeup, even full eye makeup with mascara, eyeliner and shadow - which is another stand out factor about the Aveeno Makeup Removing Wipes.</li>
            <li>While at the beach I got a little too much sun.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny because you don&#x27;t have to wipe hard to get your makeup off.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin due to rosacea and these do not set me off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> They do their job effectively.</li>
            <li> Nice and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I liked it and it removed my makeup, but it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li> I have used many makeup wipes but none as good as these.  </li>
            <li> (it honestly feels like I rubbed my face with grease</li>
            <li> To avoid rubbing, i apply my nourishing Boots eye makeup remover with some warm water around the eyes to allow the makeup to loosen, then i wipe everything with the Aveeno.</li>
            <li> They smell nice and the wipes are not overpowering.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for quickly removing face and eye makeup without irritation or a strong smell.</li>
            <li> they clean great.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for myself many times and have gifted them to friends who have also loved them.</li>
            <li> These wipes are by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of wipes and these are THE BEST!</li>
            <li> The best wipes for eye makeup removal - The only ones of the many I have tried that DO NOT irritate my eyes....  Love them!</li>
            <li> Great for removing makeup or refreshing your face on a hot, steamy day.</li>
            <li> Does a good job except when I am using super goop sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I use them morning and night and love them.</li>
            <li> It also has the snap-close top to help the wipes from drying out.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s okay, but I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Better than Neutrogena wipes, in my opinion, and they don&#x27;t sting my face the way that Neutrogena wipes sometimes do.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> These work fabulous and no need to worry about break outs-great wipes!</li>
            <li> Love these cloths.  </li>
            <li> my favorite nightly ritual is removing the debris of the day with these Aveeno pads.</li>
            <li> I have tried many makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li> I use one on my face every night, and most nights, that&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes - I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more then 25 wipes.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i came here to purchase some more but found the price at drugstore.com to be better</li>
            <li> Love Vernon.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite face wipes.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love the scent too.  </li>
            <li> These wipes feel OK</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and soft with a really pleasant scent, but also get rid of all of my makeup and seem to exfoliate too.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great, and if I do use a serum or cream, it seems to be absorbed much more quickly than if I used soap and water to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They smell so good and are really gentle.</li>
            <li> The makeup comes off so easily</li>
            <li> I love the clean scent too.</li>
            <li> Very mild</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels afterwards, clean and silky and not oily.</li>
            <li> Strong perfumes give me headaches.</li>
            <li> this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Very effective in removing make up, leaving soft and clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> And the smell is wonderful, very light and delicate like chamomile tea, not</li>
            <li> gentle and effective for eye makeup removal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few and these are the best.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, work very well.</li>
            <li> Gentle, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy around the eyes and leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Light smell is pleasing as well.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these daily and is happy she doesn&#x27;t have to run to the store and can have these in 2 days with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> And good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased these for a trip and liked them so much, now use them at home.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle on sensitive skin and still do a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smells good, and cleans the make up right off!</li>
            <li> They take off all of my make-up, leave my face clean and refreshed, and smelling FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Takes the first step of cleaning my face so much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken them with me to the beach, the pool, (great for when that mascara runs) and after a long day I just wipe it away!</li>
            <li> the wipes clean well and are soothing - yes I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I continue to use them, but will always be on the lookout for something better, and maybe finally make my own.</li>
            <li> I leave these by my bed and use them at night which helps my skin stay clean.</li>
            <li> Gets makeup off easily and no crazy smells.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by another reviewer, they are an awesome size, don&#x27;t tear, stretch readily, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, though if I had a complaint I would wish for fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> These do  clean, and if you have sensitive skin, they are kind.</li>
            <li> The wipes are wonderful for at least 2 reasons: 1) after I clean, there&#x27;s no need to moisturize or use anything astringent, and 2) the packaging style allows you to remove the wipe(s) you need and then reclose the package without the remaining wipes drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i can vouche for the gentle part. :)</li>
            <li> The most gentle wipe I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are soft and pretty good sized.  </li>
            <li> One towelette, which comes perfectly moist, completely cleans off my makeup and mascara without making my face feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Great product but Amazon&#x27;s price was almost twice that of other retailers.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> Simply the best facial wipe.</li>
            <li> And as someone that had blemishes earlier in my life and skin drying issues and all sorts of facial issues - I can say with confidence that these work great for me!</li>
            <li> Super oily and made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> Super gentle, light moisturizing, but clean well.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite wipes.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> They work the best, especially for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The snap lid isn&#x27;t very good, I had to use multiple wipes to remove all the makeup I had on (and I don&#x27;t even wear much!!), AND it left this greasy film on my fingers and face</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin, and these work perfectly for cleansing my skin, and preventing the burn of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;7/ helped me indeed calm the irritation and the redness with time.</li>
            <li> Love these for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read that some people like the smell, I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Many times when I use products that say &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;, my skin would still be irritable or would &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; after applying lotion or something to it.</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully, but if you&#x27;re wearing heavy makeup you&#x27;ll probably need 2 to completely get it off.</li>
            <li> I like this even more than my neutrogena wipes because they don&#x27;t burn my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> And I was thrilled that it removes facial and eye make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other good brands like Neutrogena but their packages have a supposedly re-useable sticky to open/close the package.</li>
            <li> This product gently but fully removes all those products and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  </li>
            <li> The wipes did leave my skin soft, but the smell was so strong that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing them, i had used Blum, Neutrogena, Simple (which i really liked), Garnier, Alba Botanica, and probably several more which i can&#x27;t recall.</li>
            <li> They remove all your make-up, don&#x27;t dry out your skin &amp; smell nice.</li>
            <li> First off,I love Aveeno products in general.</li>
            <li> this is so soft on my face, it does not create any skin irritants and works great with taking off makeup or any other dirt from face.</li>
            <li> Really like how this soothes my face and removes all the makeup and keeps me moisturized before bed!</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews associated with this product on Amazon are reviews for a different Aveeno product.</li>
            <li> i found those at Jewel first because it said \\&quot;ultra calming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> These make my skin feel wonderfully soft and clean.</li>
            <li> feels clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin clean, fresh and no residue.</li>
            <li> I found it at half the price and ordered several more, love the product itself.  </li>
            <li> The Aveeno make up removing wipes are very soft and large in size as compared to other popular brands.  </li>
            <li> They are so gentle.</li>
            <li> The Aveeno wipes were really cooling and moisturizing. .</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes because they even get off your eye makeup including your mascara.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Anyway, I gave this product (the makeup removing wipes) 5 stars because it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very calming (as it reads on the package).</li>
            <li> Gentle and calming to your face but does the job well.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> and I really like them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> These are really soothing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> These wipes remove makeup really well, aside from waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> and i am someone who really doesnt like drugstore beauty products</li>
            <li> Very well and without any burning, or irritation.</li>
            <li> Sturdy cloth, gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> but they leave too much of a residue on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even be willing to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite, hands down.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is I&#x27;m glad I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to find an other solution because these Aveeno wipes are the BOMB!</li>
            <li> I like these very much,but I wish they were just a little bit more moist.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them for half the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and this is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my skin go into over-active itchy mode.</li>
            <li> in fact you can find many of those for just 3.99 at your local Marshalls in the beauty isle, they have different brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a softer feel to Aveeno that is so  much nicer than many of the other brands and the size of the towelette is larger than many other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have itchy, sensitive, very reactive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> These are so gentle and soft and stretchy, not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> its soft and gentle, and leaves a soft feel to your skin!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and have very sensitive skin with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> They are so very soft and work so well to remove makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am also very sensitive to perfumes and these wipes don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong so after I clean my face with them I take a wet wash cloth and get the residue off.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and yet needed something to remove my &amp;#34;last all day&amp;#34; type foundation, eyeliner!, and lip stain.  </li>
            <li> I very much like Aveeno products to begin with, especially when my skin gets sensitive.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save makes it a bargain and completely effortless.</li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin product, I don&#x27;t know why they added a fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it left my face very greasy as if I just put on a layer of greasy face lotion</li>
            <li> Moist, soft, cleansing.....super price and convenient sending.....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I was looking for a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; wipe to use before washing with my sensitive skin soap.</li>
            <li> They are soft too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> they STRETCH, they dont tear, and they are as soft as silk.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, try those.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin soft and nurtured.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes, gets the makeup off and makes my skin feel soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> You may still want to follow it with a quick cleanse, but in a pinch (long, long day at work &amp; just want it off your face before you crash)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t normal for me, especially in pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> They are large enough that 1 wipe does your entire face</li>
            <li> I have tried Simple, Ponds, Oil of Olay and many other make up removing wipe brands only to find my skin seriously itchy, irritated or not feeling clean after using them.</li>
            <li> These actually stay moist to cut up and use again and again... and gentle enough to use on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have extreamly sensitive skin and was worried how my skin would react but not only did I not react to them</li>
            <li> I recently tried a store brand for sensitive skin to save money</li>
            <li> i tried to leave it on a few times, and i felt like a silky gel on my skin for about 5 minutes, but then the skin absorbed it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Aveeno wipes, but my only complaint is ... why make a pack of 25?</li>
            <li> These wipes are serious about taking off eye makeup, even full eye makeup with mascara, eyeliner and shadow - which is another stand out factor about the Aveeno Makeup Removing Wipes.</li>
            <li> While at the beach I got a little too much sun.</li>
            <li> They are worth every penny because you don&#x27;t have to wipe hard to get your makeup off.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin due to rosacea and these do not set me off.  </li>
            <li> All three of us have sensitive skin and these wipes don&#x27;t make our faces turn red like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I still get better results by doing the whole traditional makeup removal routine, but for lazy nights, I don&#x27;t feel a bit guilty using these.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take my eye makeup off as good as the Neutragena ones :(</li>
            <li> That pink label is plastic and you can open it,  remove the wipes and it clicks back shut so the wipes stay moist until all are used.  </li>
            <li> quickly without leaving behind a residue.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like other makeup removers do.  </li>
            <li> In my experience the sticky wears out long before the package&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve only tried one other brand.</li>
            <li> i use Differin on my skin, and when i am at the gym with all the salty sweat, my skin gets irritated, dry and reddish.</li>
            <li> They take off all my makeup with just a single towelette.</li>
            <li> I have mixed zones of dry and slightly oily skin on my 62-yo face.</li>
            <li> they have a delicate scent, they are not heavily fragranced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the sunscreen is water proof so it is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> B003ZYM7EA POND?S Exfoliating Renewal Wet Cleansing Towelettes, 30-Count (Pack of 2)]] instead.</li>
            <li> Seriously, i have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about, i was surprised to read them.</li>
            <li> This way a single pack would last for at least a month.</li>
            <li> They do not sting like the other brands</li>
            <li> and I got extreme irritation and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> However they do seem a little dry</li>
            <li> To be honest, we are just too lazy to wash with facial soap and water (and I hate that water get in your hair and down your shirt!).  </li>
            <li> Although my skin is a little pink after using the wipe - of course, to be expected when cleaning your skin - but there is ZERO irritation or itchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Last I checked, there are 30 or 31 days in all but one month of the year, so why not make a pack of at least 30?</li>
            <li> They did remove the makeup; however, they left this very slick, greasy residue all over.</li>
            <li> There is just an odd oily feel to them.</li>
            <li> I also have trouble if I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> and if I use them every day I tend to have a few breakouts.</li>
            <li> That drug really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I even gave them a few more tries, and my face felt disgusting each time.</li>
            <li> No more dried up wipes.  </li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products, but I was very disappointed with these wipes.</li>
            <li> Would get painful, large blemishes before Accutane.</li>
            <li> Removed my makeup including mascara as well as, if not better than the Neutrogena makeup wipes I was using.</li>
            <li> So in a hurry and desperate for some wipes, I decided to try a few different brands and &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; them out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t sting my face.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I started having a hard time finding the Biore wipes</li>
            <li> so I went online and still had a hard time finding them in stock anywhere.  </li>
            <li> and they are not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> No or very subtle scent, nothing offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had crazy skin in my life and took Accutane in my late teens/early twenties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of makeup wipes, including expensive boutique brands.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with these .</li>
            <li> 4 Stars for that reason :(</li>
            <li> Made my face break out terribly!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> the wipes clean well and are soothing - yes I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite wipes. They smell so good and are really gentle. Through subscribe and save they are a great deal on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I take these camping!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take my eye makeup off as good as the Neutragena ones :(</li>
            <li> gentle and effective for eye makeup removal</li>
            <li> I have extreamly sensitive skin and was worried how my skin would react but not only did I not react to them I fell in love with these!  They are a most have!! I&#x27;ve taken them with me to the beach, the pool, (great for when that mascara runs) and after a long day I just wipe it away! Love them!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST  for washing your face and removing makeup if you have sensitive skin!!!!  I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> Very good makeup removing wipes. Gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards. My daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> Best face cleansing cloths that I have found.  They remove all your make-up, don&#x27;t dry out your skin &amp; smell nice.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones I use. They are so gentle. They do not sting like the other brands do yet they clean great.I use them morning and night and love them.</li>
            <li> These do  clean, and if you have sensitive skin, they are kind. There is just an odd oily feel to them. I continue to use them, but will always be on the lookout for something better, and maybe finally make my own.</li>
            <li> I loved them when purchased at the grocery store.  One towelette, which comes perfectly moist, completely cleans off my makeup and mascara without making my face feel dry.  It also has the snap-close top to help the wipes from drying out.  Buying them from this seller saves me two - four dollars per pack, so great deal!</li>
            <li> plan to reorder. I used this instead of the one that caused my eyes to burn and this one did not cause my eyes to burn and took off my make up well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of makeup wipes, including expensive boutique brands.  These are my favorite, hands down.  I have very sensitive skin due to rosacea and these do not set me off.  I still get better results by doing the whole traditional makeup removal routine, but for lazy nights, I don&#x27;t feel a bit guilty using these.  Subscribe and Save makes it a bargain and completely effortless.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out terribly!</li>
            <li> Love it! Removes makeup well.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes!  Super gentle, light moisturizing, but clean well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t deal with the overpowering fragrance and had to wash it off. Strong perfumes give me headaches. For a sensitive skin product, I don&#x27;t know why they added a fragrance. The wipes did leave my skin soft, but the smell was so strong that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. I use it for morning and night care. While at the beach I got a little too much sun. The Aveeno wipes were really cooling and moisturizing. .</li>
            <li> Really nice thank you</li>
            <li> Really like how this soothes my face and removes all the makeup and keeps me moisturized before bed!</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like other makeup removers do.  It makes my skin feel so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job except when I am using super goop sunscreen.  But the sunscreen is water proof so it is to be expected.  I also have trouble if I use it every day.  I have very sensitive skin and if I use them every day I tend to have a few breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this product! its soft and gentle, and leaves a soft feel to your skin!</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite! I&#x27;ve tried a few and these are the best.</li>
            <li> It got all the makeup off even water proof mascara but it left my face very greasy as if I just put on a layer of greasy face lotion so I end up washing it off afterward. Think I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> Simply the best facial wipe.</li>
            <li> These wipes are by far the best on the market.  I have tried Simple, Ponds, Oil of Olay and many other make up removing wipe brands only to find my skin seriously itchy, irritated or not feeling clean after using them. The Aveeno make up removing wipes are very soft and large in size as compared to other popular brands.  These wipes are serious about taking off eye makeup, even full eye makeup with mascara, eyeliner and shadow - which is another stand out factor about the Aveeno Makeup Removing Wipes. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have very sensitive skin with rosacea.  Although my skin is a little pink after using the wipe - of course, to be expected when cleaning your skin - but there is ZERO irritation or itchy feeling.  I love them and find them to be fairly priced.  I won&#x27;t be caught without them!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only make-up remover wipes I have found that removes your eye make up (mascara) quickly without leaving behind a residue. Love it! And good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Moist, soft, cleansing.....super price and convenient sending.....with subscribing</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Take the makeup off &amp; have a great smell :)</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes because they even get off your eye makeup including your mascara. The smell is a little strong so after I clean my face with them I take a wet wash cloth and get the residue off. They are worth every penny because you don&#x27;t have to wipe hard to get your makeup off.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, work very well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and yet needed something to remove my &amp;#34;last all day&amp;#34; type foundation, eyeliner!, and lip stain.  This product gently but fully removes all those products and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  You may still want to follow it with a quick cleanse, but in a pinch (long, long day at work &amp; just want it off your face before you crash) this works just fine.</li>
            <li> The only make up wipe I will use ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smells good, and cleans the make up right off!</li>
            <li> They do their job effectively. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s oily and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them burning my skin or causing break outs. I read that some people like the smell, I&#x27;m not crazy about it. I suppose it&#x27;s okay, but I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li> this is so soft on my face, it does not create any skin irritants and works great with taking off makeup or any other dirt from face. fast shipping</li>
            <li> This review is for Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes. Many of the reviews associated with this product on Amazon are reviews for a different Aveeno product. Maybe Amazon can get this straightened out. Anyway, I gave this product (the makeup removing wipes) 5 stars because it works very well for me. I have itchy, sensitive, very reactive skin on my face. I have tried many different brands and this is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my skin go into over-active itchy mode. For me, this is an excellent product and I am so happy to have found it. Great for removing makeup or refreshing your face on a hot, steamy day. A+!!</li>
            <li> My go -to make up remover. Gentle, and smells nice. I have eczema so i can vouche for the gentle part. :)</li>
            <li> The best makeup Removing wipes ever used, thank you Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Nice and convenient.  My skin looks good when I use these.  Good for after workouts, too.</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged and amazon took care of it anyway. Great product.</li>
            <li> Takes the first step of cleaning my face so much more convenient.  I will continue to purchase them.  I wish they would make one especially for the eye area.</li>
            <li> I just bought the makeup removing wipes, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with them. The makeup comes off so easily and I don&#x27;t have to sit there and wipe for ages. It&#x27;s easy around the eyes and leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! I&#x27;ve had crazy skin in my life and took Accutane in my late teens/early twenties. Would get painful, large blemishes before Accutane. That drug really dried out my skin. My mom had rosacea, which I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t develop later in life like she did. Many times when I use products that say &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;, my skin would still be irritable or would &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; after applying lotion or something to it. These wipes are very calming (as it reads on the package). And as someone that had blemishes earlier in my life and skin drying issues and all sorts of facial issues - I can say with confidence that these work great for me! Now, everyone&#x27;s skin can react differently, but for me - these are the bomb!</li>
            <li> I love these. I have to say I&#x27;ve only tried one other brand. These make my skin feel wonderfully soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Aveeno wipes, but my only complaint is ... why make a pack of 25? Last I checked, there are 30 or 31 days in all but one month of the year, so why not make a pack of at least 30? This way a single pack would last for at least a month. I&#x27;d even be willing to pay a little more. Aside from that, they&#x27;re great! Better than Neutrogena wipes, in my opinion, and they don&#x27;t sting my face the way that Neutrogena wipes sometimes do. I have rosacea and sensitive skin, and these work perfectly for cleansing my skin, and preventing the burn of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> These are great. They&#x27;re nice and soft with a really pleasant scent, but also get rid of all of my makeup and seem to exfoliate too.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup removing wipes out there.  Gentle and calming to your face but does the job well.  What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Did not like these at all. Super oily and made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I was looking for a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; wipe to use before washing with my sensitive skin soap. These work fabulous and no need to worry about break outs-great wipes!</li>
            <li> Love these cloths.  They are so very soft and work so well to remove makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> These feel so good on your skin and remove all my makeup before bed.</li>
            <li> my favorite nightly ritual is removing the debris of the day with these Aveeno pads.</li>
            <li> I liked it and it removed my makeup, but it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li> I leave these by my bed and use them at night which helps my skin stay clean. They def. take makeup off also.</li>
            <li> I have tried many makeup remover wipes.  There is a softer feel to Aveeno that is so  much nicer than many of the other brands and the size of the towelette is larger than many other brands.  I originally purchased these for a trip and liked them so much, now use them at home.</li>
            <li> Excellent for rosaira on face.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review a while back blaming this product for an allergic reaction that turned out to be an infection.  My deepest apologies to Aveeno, and anyone who read that review.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my third package of these wipes.  I use one on my face every night, and most nights, that&#x27;s all I use.  My skin looks and feels great, and if I do use a serum or cream, it seems to be absorbed much more quickly than if I used soap and water to clean my face.  I&#x27;m delighted by Aveeno&#x27;s effectiveness and ease of use.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day when the kids finally fall asleep sometimes the last thing I want to do is wash my face and take my makeup off. I would say these wipes are especially handy on those days! They work wonderfully, but if you&#x27;re wearing heavy makeup you&#x27;ll probably need 2 to completely get it off.</li>
            <li> Removed my makeup including mascara as well as, if not better than the Neutrogena makeup wipes I was using. Did not irritate the rosacea on my nose and cheeks like the Netrogena ones. Definitely will continue using!</li>
            <li> Removes my entire face of makeup with just one wipe (primer, concealer, foundation, blush, shadow, eyeliner, waterproof mascara, lipstick!). The most gentle wipe I&#x27;ve used. I purchased this on a whim and I&#x27;m glad I did. I like this even more than my neutrogena wipes because they don&#x27;t burn my sensitive eyes. Light smell is pleasing as well.</li>
            <li> These take off all makeup (including eye) with one sheet.  Maybe not waterproof mascara, but surely regular.  They are soft and pretty good sized.  The pack is resealable so they stay moist.  Not necessary to rinse and face feels clean and soft.  Very convenient.  No or very subtle scent, nothing offensive.</li>
            <li> The best wipes for eye makeup removal - The only ones of the many I have tried that DO NOT irritate my eyes....  Love them!</li>
            <li> These are the only facial cleansing wipes I have tried that DO NOT sting my eyes! These are perfect for quickly removing face and eye makeup without irritation or a strong smell. I have purchased these for myself many times and have gifted them to friends who have also loved them.</li>
            <li> Great product but Amazon&#x27;s price was almost twice that of other retailers.  I found it at half the price and ordered several more, love the product itself.  Just buy it someplace else for 5.99 or 6.99 instead of the 11.99 I paid for it with amazon.</li>
            <li> Best make up removing pads that I&#x27;ve found!! I love the clean scent too.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes - I&#x27;m hooked for life. Gets makeup off easily and no crazy smells.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these. They take off all of my make-up, leave my face clean and refreshed, and smelling FANTASTIC. I subscribe and save on these because I can&#x27;t be without them now!</li>
            <li> love the product, too expensive to buy online.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The wipes remove all makeup, including mascara.  Very mild and they are not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno! These makeup wipes are so saturated with the makeup remover! It takes off all of my makeup, even water proof mascara! I just wish there was more then 25 wipes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product by a wonderful brand.  My wife uses these daily and is happy she doesn&#x27;t have to run to the store and can have these in 2 days with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I very much like Aveeno products to begin with, especially when my skin gets sensitive. I&#x27;ve used their colloidal oatmeal since my kids were newborns 32 years ago. I have just tried these and I&#x27;m hooked.  As mentioned by another reviewer, they are an awesome size, don&#x27;t tear, stretch readily, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, though if I had a complaint I would wish for fragrance free.  I love how my face feels afterwards, clean and silky and not oily. They take off all my makeup with just a single towelette. As good a product as I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to a lot of ingredients and don&#x27;t like perfumes, so I thought I would try these and I really like them quite a bit. They are very gentle but do an excellent job of taking off eye make up. They are soft too. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many makeup wipes but none as good as these.  That pink label is plastic and you can open it,  remove the wipes and it clicks back shut so the wipes stay moist until all are used.  No more dried up wipes.  They are very gentle on sensitive skin and still do a great job of cleaning.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with these .</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at ALL. The snap lid isn&#x27;t very good, I had to use multiple wipes to remove all the makeup I had on (and I don&#x27;t even wear much!!), AND it left this greasy film on my fingers and face (it honestly feels like I rubbed my face with grease, it isn&#x27;t at all like the \\&quot;just put on moisturizer\\&quot; feel). Yuck. Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now.  They work the best, especially for dry skin.  I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are really soothing and non-irritating. I have extremely sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t sting my face. These wipes remove makeup really well, aside from waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Seriously, i have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about, i was surprised to read them. i use Differin on my skin, and when i am at the gym with all the salty sweat, my skin gets irritated, dry and reddish. i found those at Jewel first because it said \\&quot;ultra calming\\&quot;. Before purchasing them, i had used Blum, Neutrogena, Simple (which i really liked), Garnier, Alba Botanica, and probably several more which i can&#x27;t recall. in fact you can find many of those for just 3.99 at your local Marshalls in the beauty isle, they have different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways, i was very pleasantly surprised:&lt;br /&gt;1/ the wipes are larger in size than the others. you need 1 to remove everything.&lt;br /&gt;2/ they STRETCH, they dont tear, and they are as soft as silk. in fact, they are the softest i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;3/ given their size, you can keep folding and folding while cleansing to cover different areas of your face&lt;br /&gt;4/ work wonderfully well on both eyes and face. BUT i dont only rely on those wipes for my cleansing. To avoid rubbing, i apply my nourishing Boots eye makeup remover with some warm water around the eyes to allow the makeup to loosen, then i wipe everything with the Aveeno. After that, i wash my face with the absolutely terrific Cerave hydrating cleanser. and i am someone who really doesnt like drugstore beauty products but those are all great.&lt;br /&gt;5/ it does not leave a greasy film on your face (if you dont rinse like i do). i tried to leave it on a few times, and i felt like a silky gel on my skin for about 5 minutes, but then the skin absorbed it all.&lt;br /&gt;6/ they have a delicate scent, they are not heavily fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;7/ helped me indeed calm the irritation and the redness with time. my skin feels and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i came here to purchase some more but found the price at drugstore.com to be better and now i buy them in lots of 4! if you have sensitive skin, try those.</li>
            <li> Love Vernon. It calms my skin as well as removes all my make up. They are large enough that 1 wipe does your entire face</li>
            <li> These are my favorite face wipes.  I have 2 teenage daughters and all three of us use these every night to wash our faces before going to bed.  To be honest, we are just too lazy to wash with facial soap and water (and I hate that water get in your hair and down your shirt!).  We just pop these wipes out and get the makeup off in seconds.  All three of us have sensitive skin and these wipes don&#x27;t make our faces turn red like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I have mixed zones of dry and slightly oily skin on my 62-yo face. The wipes are wonderful for at least 2 reasons: 1) after I clean, there&#x27;s no need to moisturize or use anything astringent, and 2) the packaging style allows you to remove the wipe(s) you need and then reclose the package without the remaining wipes drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other good brands like Neutrogena but their packages have a supposedly re-useable sticky to open/close the package. In my experience the sticky wears out long before the package&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very sensitive to perfumes and these wipes don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of wipes and these are THE BEST! I recently tried a store brand for sensitive skin to save money and I got extreme irritation and puffiness around my eyes. I exchanged them for these and it cleared up in two days! These are so gentle and soft and stretchy, not abrasive at all. And the smell is wonderful, very light and delicate like chamomile tea, not perfumey!&lt;br /&gt;TIP: They are also great for wiping under your eyes during the day to remove smudging from your mascara  without ruining your makeup.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products, but I was very disappointed with these wipes. They did remove the makeup; however, they left this very slick, greasy residue all over. I had to wash my face after using them. I even gave them a few more tries, and my face felt disgusting each time. I&#x27;ll go back to using Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The best make up remover I ever used. It does leave your skin soft and nurtured. I don&#x27;t need to put moisture cream at all if I use these wipes.</li>
            <li> First off,I love Aveeno products in general. I use the foam face wash and the moisturizer. So why not try the wipes? I did and I like them, As the packaging says &amp;#34;ulta calming&amp;#34; they are just that. However they do seem a little dry but I wiped using the front of the wipe and the back and my make up came off without any problems. I decided to purchase the wipes because I use the face wash on a daily basis. They smell nice and the wipes are not overpowering. I like these very much,but I wish they were just a little bit more moist. 4 Stars for that reason :(</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy I took up swimming and used these before I got in the pool.  They worked so well that I started using them every night.  Since I started using them (three months ago), I haven&#x27;t had one blemish.  This isn&#x27;t normal for me, especially in pregnancy.  I am very happy with them and I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them for half the price.</li>
            <li> This was my &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; package. And I was thrilled that it removes facial and eye make up. Very well and without any burning, or irritation. Left my skin clean, fresh and no residue.Love them. Will keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes, gets the makeup off and makes my skin feel soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> Works well. Sturdy cloth, gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> These actually stay moist to cut up and use again and again... and gentle enough to use on my eyes.</li>
            <li> The best makeup removing wipe I have ever used. It leaves my face moist and relieved.</li>
            <li> Very effective in removing make up, leaving soft and clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I used to only use Biore. I thought Biore was the best until.... About a year ago I started having a hard time finding the Biore wipes so I went online and still had a hard time finding them in stock anywhere.  So in a hurry and desperate for some wipes, I decided to try a few different brands and &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; them out. Aveeno was one of those I tested. All I can say is I&#x27;m glad I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to find an other solution because these Aveeno wipes are the BOMB! I love them. They do the job and they do it &amp;#34;gently&amp;#34;. I love the scent too.  I feel like my skin is so &amp;#34;refreshed and energized&amp;#34; after using them! Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> These wipes feel OK and I like the packaging... but they leave too much of a residue on my face.  Try [[ASIN:B003ZYM7EA POND?S Exfoliating Renewal Wet Cleansing Towelettes, 30-Count (Pack of 2)]] instead.</li>
            <li> Very best eye makeup remover!</li>
