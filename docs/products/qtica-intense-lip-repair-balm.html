    <ol>
            <li>But it&#x27;s awesome otherwise!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s long-lasting and the BEST lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This is one of the BEST lip healing softening &amp; protective products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Perfect applicator too.</li>
            <li>This product is hands-down THE BEST!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it is absolutely perfect for putting on at night and waking up with healed lips.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!!</li>
            <li>Best lip treatment I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Incredible balm to wear at night!  </li>
            <li>this Qtica is the best thing ive found for my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>The best lip balm Iâ€™ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>so it was a great buy!</li>
            <li>Also, it may not be great for summertime because it does tend to liquify some in the heat.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - it heals yours lips when they are de-hydrated and helps when they are cracked.  </li>
            <li>Great product does wonders for the lips</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>sum up, this lip balm is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than the one chapstick makes :D</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm, my lips are always chapped and this is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>Its so good my husband also uses and loves it.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the great reviews and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I came across Qtica, I was impressed by the volume of very positive reviews, but I was still reluctant to pull the trigger, because (as a guy)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite balm and I have tried them all!  </li>
            <li>Carmex and I was better off with Vaseline!</li>
            <li>My lips look amazing after this is applied.</li>
            <li>but this is really the best.</li>
            <li>kind of like medicine or carmex or something.</li>
            <li>keep those lips nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Kinda pricey but soft lips are priceless!!</li>
            <li>it was going to be more effective.</li>
            <li>Its just the best, I use it daily under my lip stick or by itself and always at night before bed.</li>
            <li>This is more of an overnight application.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>like you have a waxy film sitting on top of your lips.</li>
            <li>Using them seems to somehow make them more chapped within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I can put it on and not think about it or if I need more.</li>
            <li>so one dollar more here isn&#x27;t too bad!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Pack of 2)]], and many others...</li>
            <li>(and many of the others didn&#x27;t work at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was hoping for a pleasant taste and smell for something that costs this much for a lip treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a hint of a tingle, but nothing to strong.</li>
            <li>Of these, Jack Black Intense Lip Therapy seemed to work the best, but I still wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with just a lip pencil for a natural look or I use it before appling my lip gloss for a smooth fresh look.</li>
            <li>I got motivated to find a product that worked differently and found the excellent reviews for Qtica&#x27;s Intense Lip Repair Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels good so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try it because it was not petroleum based and had the one ingredient none of the others had...</li>
            <li>the price is worth it because it lasts forevvvver, you dont need a lot!</li>
            <li>I use several good lip products, including Josie Maron, Philosophy, Khiels, Jack Black, and they all have their good qualities and some great ones, but I have VERY dry lips most of the time even with using lip polish/scrub every day.</li>
            <li>I wear this everyday since it feels great and doesn&#x27;t come off easily...</li>
            <li>The Qtica is super thick and so great!!</li>
            <li>It is great for chapped lips or any other problem your lips may have</li>
            <li>Luckily I found that statement to be untrue...</li>
            <li>Well, from the very first night I started using it my lips seemed to get even drier.</li>
            <li>keeps my lips soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I am a frugal person and this is worth it.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Ultimately, it was the BEST money that I have ever spent on lip care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and absolutely LOVE it; my lips are never dry or cracked anymore.</li>
            <li>It has the same feel, but this might actually work better because it&#x27;s more hydrating</li>
            <li>A friend turned me onto it years ago, she had purchased it from a beauty supply store and that was the only place I have been able to find it before checking Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first purchased Qtica at a salon.  </li>
            <li>but it did not make my lips as smooth and soft as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Will try and find something similar with more of a flavor though</li>
            <li>i have tried many lip balms from burts bees to standard ones to even Vaseline.</li>
            <li>it makes my lips instantly feel better and provides moisture all day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ready to put it to the test this winter!</li>
            <li>It smells different (medicated, like Carmex) than the product I was trying to get more of, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, especially with the high price and good reviews, but is absolutely was NOT for me.</li>
            <li>Sure if you apply too much of this onto your lips, they will appear white.</li>
            <li>It worked way better than this pricey product - I only paid so much thinking</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for soft and smooth lips</li>
            <li>My lips get dry and peel because I wear lipstick most days.</li>
            <li>I bought Intense Lip Repair Balm from Pure Essence Health.</li>
            <li>tried several of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lip balms that were widely available, but they did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>The real product is 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>real product says Qtica Intense Lip Repair Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li>product says Qtica Intense Lip Therapy Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, maybe Qtica changed their product, so I went to the Qtica website and they are still selling the \\&quot;intense lip repair balm\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>They were not offering an \\&quot;intense lip therapy balm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very affordable.  </li>
            <li>When i use this religiously, i can get my lips healed and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Intense Therapy Lip Balm Lemon &amp; Chamomile]]</li>
            <li>By the end of the following week, my lips looked soft, healthy and quite kissable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is thick and feels good as a pm treatment.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lip repair balm for many years and have tried other brands</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, chapstick does a better job.</li>
            <li>Wake up with new lips!  </li>
            <li>the product works well but not any better than some organic lip balms that cost half price.  </li>
            <li>I stock up, everyone in my family - male and female- love it.</li>
            <li>makes my lips soft as ever!!</li>
            <li>One tub of this balm lasts me more than just a few months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on white but quickly becomes clear.  </li>
            <li>Desperation eventually got the better of me, and I decided to buy Qtica (and paid nearly twice the price of anything that I had previously tried)...  </li>
            <li>~ I got sucked into the hype and packaging of a new product by Maybelline and threw my money away again at something that does not come close to the long-term hydration or smoothness that this product gives my lips.</li>
            <li>Once I tried this I stopped adding new lip balm products to my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska.</li>
            <li>BTW I have very sensitive skin, My lips would crack and swell when I would use anything.</li>
            <li>If you have VERY dry or cracked lips, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I thought it would on clear.</li>
            <li>and it last a much longer time.</li>
            <li>and they are fixed.</li>
            <li>This product prevented additional lip chewing and smoothed the skin so that my lips are soft and supple once again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very white and will be very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY LIPS SOFT AND DONT HURT.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it turning my lips white, these people are probably using too much.</li>
            <li>My lips are finally soft.</li>
            <li>I continued to apply the stuff about 3-4 times a day (including a thick coat before bed), and after my first full week of use, my embarrassingly damaged lips had almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li>This lip conditioner actually helps to remove the dry layer of skin from your lips leaving them looking years younger and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Because it is so strong, you will only need to use it a few times but when you do, you&#x27;re lips</li>
            <li>As a guy, I tend to avoid buying over-priced \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products--especially when there are usually comparable products available at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Carmex, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Pure Silk and more have all failed me.</li>
            <li>After a few tries (thinking it needed a few times to be effective), it didn&#x27;t irritate us as much.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s reviews of Qtica got my hopes up high that maybe my lips would finally get back to normalcy again.</li>
            <li>This product is the only one that really works for my dry lips.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other lip repairing balm I have used before, it is like lotion for you lips, other petroleum based lip remedies only protect your lips from further drying, while this one actually moisturizes and heals them, it works for me overnight.</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to get out, keep it in your pocket and when it is warm it comes out easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually get it from a urgent care clinic (yes, you read that right) but the lady was out of it.</li>
            <li>in my opinion, worth the extra few dollars!</li>
            <li>most balms never stay on long enough and they are too thin.</li>
            <li>This was the tenth thing I had tried and finally got good results although I thought it was a little expensive.</li>

            <li> ~ I got sucked into the hype and packaging of a new product by Maybelline and threw my money away again at something that does not come close to the long-term hydration or smoothness that this product gives my lips.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this I stopped adding new lip balm products to my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska.</li>
            <li> BTW I have very sensitive skin, My lips would crack and swell when I would use anything.</li>
            <li> If you have VERY dry or cracked lips, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I thought it would on clear.</li>
            <li> and it last a much longer time.</li>
            <li> and they are fixed.</li>
            <li> This product prevented additional lip chewing and smoothed the skin so that my lips are soft and supple once again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very white and will be very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY LIPS SOFT AND DONT HURT.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it turning my lips white, these people are probably using too much.</li>
            <li> My lips are finally soft.</li>
            <li> I continued to apply the stuff about 3-4 times a day (including a thick coat before bed), and after my first full week of use, my embarrassingly damaged lips had almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li> This lip conditioner actually helps to remove the dry layer of skin from your lips leaving them looking years younger and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Because it is so strong, you will only need to use it a few times but when you do, you&#x27;re lips</li>
            <li> As a guy, I tend to avoid buying over-priced \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products--especially when there are usually comparable products available at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Carmex, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Pure Silk and more have all failed me.</li>
            <li> After a few tries (thinking it needed a few times to be effective), it didn&#x27;t irritate us as much.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s reviews of Qtica got my hopes up high that maybe my lips would finally get back to normalcy again.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that really works for my dry lips.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip repairing balm I have used before, it is like lotion for you lips, other petroleum based lip remedies only protect your lips from further drying, while this one actually moisturizes and heals them, it works for me overnight.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get out, keep it in your pocket and when it is warm it comes out easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get it from a urgent care clinic (yes, you read that right) but the lady was out of it.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, worth the extra few dollars!</li>
            <li> most balms never stay on long enough and they are too thin.</li>
            <li> This was the tenth thing I had tried and finally got good results although I thought it was a little expensive.</li>
            <li> While I work long shifts for my job, I only have to apply this once and maybe twice for all day wear.</li>
            <li> I will update about how long it takes this product to heal incredibly damaged cracked peeling lips (sounds gross and it is, but doesn&#x27;t look awful with chapstick on).</li>
            <li> My lips were often very dry especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it will last a long time and it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Now, I use it in place of my everyday lip gloss for a natural sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even spent a grip on Chantecaille the fancy French lip products people raved about, it did nothing compared to this product.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I have chapped lips all year long.  </li>
            <li> They were completely dried out, cracked, and frequently bled.  </li>
            <li> Rather than buying lots of less expensive (and less effective) products, just buy this...</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with dry lips for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> The key is that the product is very thick and just stays on much longer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for people with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I spent months chewing off the little flaps of hardened, irritating lip skin and trying not to smile suddenly for fear of a crack and bleed</li>
            <li> In just few days, this product appears to have reversed several years of damage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my gross lips hadn&#x27;t completely healed after one nighttime application, but the results were definitely visible.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected ....too thick when applied...on my 6 yr old who has severely chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The somewhat heavy, thick base really allows the product to stick to your lips and the lanolin does an amazing job of softening and dissolving the dead skin flaps.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and gives you a little shine.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and tried other products before I re-ordered this and</li>
            <li> My lips are never chapped or dry and if they get that way a little dab</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slick AND stays on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer at night and in the morning my lips are soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Too thick on the lip and leaves white residue .</li>
            <li> I put a thick coat of Qtica Lip Repair Balm on over night, and when I woke up the next morning I immediately saw results.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thicker, so you need less</li>
            <li> Jack Black</li>
            <li> I used other lip balms constantly (I mean like every half hour all day!)</li>
            <li> and this last time was a fake.  </li>
            <li> My lips have no cracks and they are no longer begging to have chapstick or whatever else I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> what I think was called something like Aquaphor in a small tub.</li>
            <li> I dont usually take time to endorse products, but I think this product deserves a minute of my time.</li>
            <li> then it would look gross, but for me even with crazy chapped lips the whiteness goes away just by pressing your lips together one time.</li>
            <li> * Complaint:</li>
            <li> I usually buy 3 at a time and keep them on hand!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my lips just got worse and worse until I stopped using it at all.</li>
            <li> The air in the winter is freezing cold and as dry as a desert!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips were crazy dry!</li>
            <li> We both woke up with red and worse (painful) lips.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with my recent purchase.  </li>
            <li> Failed attempts to repair my lips include, but are not limited to: [[ASIN:B0041QW1UG EOS Tangerine Medicated Lip Balm Sphere, .25-Ounce</li>
            <li> Basically, my lips were in really bad shape and it got to the point where I became extremely self-conscious about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> the fake product doesn&#x27;t work well as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really sorry I purchased two of these because I will NOT use them again.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake.</li>
            <li> And my lips are in a constant state of being horribly chapped.</li>
            <li> I thought that the price was insane for a tiny tube of lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive lip balm...</li>
            <li> However, I embarked on a desperate search for a miracle lip balm, because my lips were beyond chapped.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started chewing my lips during a time of stress and grief.  </li>
            <li> It does make your lips softer, but it smells and tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> cause I could visualize how nasty mine might look.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does make your lips softer, but it smells and tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite balm and I have tried them all!  It lasts a long time and gives you a little shine.  I stock up, everyone in my family - male and female- love it.</li>
            <li> If you have VERY dry or cracked lips, this product is worth the money. I keep a tube by my bed and in my purse at all times. It&#x27;s also the only thing my boyfriend will use when his lips get chapped. It&#x27;s got a hint of a tingle, but nothing to strong. The key is that the product is very thick and just stays on much longer. If I put it on at night, I will wake up in the morning and still feel the residue (for some, that may not be present, but I know it&#x27;s been working all night!) Also, it may not be great for summertime because it does tend to liquify some in the heat. But it&#x27;s awesome otherwise!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey but it&#x27;s long-lasting and the BEST lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried. Haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares. I&#x27;ll never buy another lip balm.  ~~~~~~~~~~~  1 Jan 2012 ~ I got sucked into the hype and packaging of a new product by Maybelline and threw my money away again at something that does not come close to the long-term hydration or smoothness that this product gives my lips. A friend of mine was recently cured of her Burts Bees addiction after trying this too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d compare this to chapstick&#x27;s medicated lip balm. It has the same feel, but this might actually work better because it&#x27;s more hydrating, it&#x27;s thicker, so you need less and it last a much longer time. It&#x27;s way better than the one chapstick makes :D in my opinion, worth the extra few dollars! keep those lips nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip repair balm for many years and have tried other brands but this is really the best.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for people with dry lips. I use it every night before I go to bed. It is thick and feels good as a pm treatment. I am addicted!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used! I am so picky and most balms never stay on long enough and they are too thin. The Qtica is super thick and so great!! I usually buy 3 at a time and keep them on hand!</li>
            <li> The sellers change often with beauty products.  So even though Luxe Beauty isn&#x27;t listed now as a seller just know there are fakes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this product several times through amazon-- and this last time was a fake.  The real product is 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real product says Qtica Intense Lip Repair Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake product says Qtica Intense Lip Therapy Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought-- well, maybe Qtica changed their product, so I went to the Qtica website and they are still selling the \\&quot;intense lip repair balm\\&quot;.  They were not offering an \\&quot;intense lip therapy balm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fake product doesn&#x27;t work well as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the problem with amazon-- no quality control.</li>
            <li> My lips were often very dry especially in the winter. After having a facial at a prestigious spa the esthetician suggested I use Qtica lip balm and apply every night before bed. I have used this product for years and absolutely LOVE it; my lips are never dry or cracked anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - it heals yours lips when they are de-hydrated and helps when they are cracked.  It takes 4 days before you will see results if they are cracked but it works!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, my lips are always chapped and this is the best product I have found.  I would highly recommend this for soft and smooth lips</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST lip healing softening &amp; protective products I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very affordable.  Perfect applicator too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! A friend turned me onto it years ago, she had purchased it from a beauty supply store and that was the only place I have been able to find it before checking Amazon. Its just the best, I use it daily under my lip stick or by itself and always at night before bed. My lips are never chapped or dry and if they get that way a little dab and they are fixed. Its so good my husband also uses and loves it. I found that purchasing on Amazon was cheaper even with added shipping cost. I buy like 5 at a time so I always have them on hand.   They cost about 12.00 at the beauty supply store. Kinda pricey but soft lips are priceless!!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip repairing balm I have used before, it is like lotion for you lips, other petroleum based lip remedies only protect your lips from further drying, while this one actually moisturizes and heals them, it works for me overnight.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every lip product imaginable for my chronically chapped and peeling lips. This product is hands-down THE BEST!!</li>
            <li> I started chewing my lips during a time of stress and grief.  I spent months chewing off the little flaps of hardened, irritating lip skin and trying not to smile suddenly for fear of a crack and bleed situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lip balms that were widely available, but they did absolutely nothing.  I got motivated to find a product that worked differently and found the excellent reviews for Qtica&#x27;s Intense Lip Repair Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try it because it was not petroleum based and had the one ingredient none of the others had... Lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The somewhat heavy, thick base really allows the product to stick to your lips and the lanolin does an amazing job of softening and dissolving the dead skin flaps.  This product prevented additional lip chewing and smoothed the skin so that my lips are soft and supple once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on white but quickly becomes clear.  Now, I use it in place of my everyday lip gloss for a natural sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy extras.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this, just know this is the strongest lip balm I&#x27;ve ever encountered. This isn&#x27;t something you put on during the day. Its very white and will be very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is absolutely perfect for putting on at night and waking up with healed lips. Because it is so strong, you will only need to use it a few times but when you do, you&#x27;re lips will feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this, but not for the daily user. This is more of an overnight application.</li>
            <li> This was the tenth thing I had tried and finally got good results although I thought it was a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with my recent purchase.  I have been buying this for years, and it seems the formula has been changed.  It now feels like a glorified vaseline product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Qtica at a salon.  It was used to protect my lips while I had my facal.  This lip conditioner actually helps to remove the dry layer of skin from your lips leaving them looking years younger and smooth.  It&#x27;s great with just a lip pencil for a natural look or I use it before appling my lip gloss for a smooth fresh look.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, chapstick does a better job.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! makes my lips soft as ever!!</li>
            <li> Best lip treatment I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I actually am wearing it now. User since 2004</li>
            <li> Great product does wonders for the lips</li>
            <li> the product works well but not any better than some organic lip balms that cost half price.  the medicinal smell may turn some people off.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it did not make my lips as smooth and soft as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday since it feels great and doesn&#x27;t come off easily...Will try and find something similar with more of a flavor though</li>
            <li> Incredible balm to wear at night!  Wake up with new lips!  I wear it every night!</li>
            <li> i have severe chapped lips to the point where they crack and bleed. i have tried many lip balms from burts bees to standard ones to even Vaseline. vaseline works temporarily but this Qtica is the best thing ive found for my chapped lips. it makes my lips instantly feel better and provides moisture all day. the price is worth it because it lasts forevvvver, you dont need a lot! i keep this in my purse daily and use it when needed!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm. Sure if you apply too much of this onto your lips, they will appear white. While I work long shifts for my job, I only have to apply this once and maybe twice for all day wear. My lips look amazing after this is applied.My lips have no cracks and they are no longer begging to have chapstick or whatever else I have used in the past. BTW I have very sensitive skin, My lips would crack and swell when I would use anything. I was using vaseline for the longest time. Then I found this balm and decided whatnot?! This balm rocks!! I have gotten all of my co-workers hooked. One tub of this balm lasts me more than just a few months. When you use this product, squeeze where the &amp;#34;Q&amp;#34; is printed. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the great reviews and I absolutely love it. My lips get dry and peel because I wear lipstick most days. I apply a thin layer at night and in the morning my lips are soft and moisturized. I can&#x27;t say how it works on severely damaged lips but I&#x27;m ready to put it to the test this winter!</li>
            <li> this stuff tastes gross and smells gross. kind of like medicine or carmex or something. i was hoping for a pleasant taste and smell for something that costs this much for a lip treatment. it made my lips feel tingly too, and i don&#x27;t want that feature</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS STUFF FOR 20 YEARS AND WILL NOT STOP. I HAVE TRIED ALOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS BUT, WHEN I LEAVE IT ON OVER NIGHT MY LIPS SOFT AND DONT HURT. ALOT TIMES I DONT HAVE TO PUT THE CREAM ON EVERYNIGHT SO, THE STUFF LASTS FOR ATLEAST 6 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected ....too thick when applied...on my 6 yr old who has severely chapped lips.  And I didn&#x27;t like that it goes on white either...I thought it would on clear.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, especially with the high price and good reviews, but is absolutely was NOT for me. I use several good lip products, including Josie Maron, Philosophy, Khiels, Jack Black, and they all have their good qualities and some great ones, but I have VERY dry lips most of the time even with using lip polish/scrub every day. When I saw the Qtica brand on Amazon I figured I would give it a try. Well, from the very first night I started using it my lips seemed to get even drier. I continued using thinking maybe I had to use it for awhile for it to start helping. After a few weeks my lips just got worse and worse until I stopped using it at all. I am really sorry I purchased two of these because I will NOT use them again.I guess I will just throw them away and stick with what I know works for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it on 4 occasions and even got my husband to try it twice. I was looking for something to wear overnight and to bed to help with severely chapped lips. We both woke up with red and worse (painful) lips. After a few tries (thinking it needed a few times to be effective), it didn&#x27;t irritate us as much. But in all honesty, it smells just like Carmex and I was better off with Vaseline! I later found a cheaper (with an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; option for shipping) what I think was called something like Aquaphor in a small tub. It worked way better than this pricey product - I only paid so much thinking it was going to be more effective. I was wrong. Avoid QTICA.</li>
            <li> I bought Intense Lip Repair Balm from Pure Essence Health. What arrived was called &amp;#34;Intense Lip Therapy Balm&amp;#34; instead. It smells different (medicated, like Carmex) than the product I was trying to get more of, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. There&#x27;s nothing called &amp;#34;Intense Lip Therapy Balm&amp;#34; on the QTICA&#x27;s website. I think this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Love it</li>
            <li> The best lip balm Iâ€™ve ever purchased. I think Iâ€™m on my 6th tube of this stuff. Once I tried this I stopped adding new lip balm products to my makeup bag. I had tried them all Chapstick, Burts Bees. Blistex, etc. I even spent a grip on Chantecaille the fancy French lip products people raved about, it did nothing compared to this product. Qtica leaves your lips feeling moisturized, not just like you have a waxy film sitting on top of your lips. This product changed the life of lips I swear!</li>
            <li> My lips were crazy dry! lIke unbearable! I tried every lip balm out there and they didn&#x27;t do a thing besides make my lips peel. I apply this stuff every night and morning. keeps my lips soft and smooth! lasts a long time as well. so it was a great buy! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Vegas. It&#x27;s winter. And my lips are in a constant state of being horribly chapped. Carmex, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Pure Silk and more have all failed me. Using them seems to somehow make them more chapped within a couple of hours. Everyone&#x27;s reviews of Qtica got my hopes up high that maybe my lips would finally get back to normalcy again. Feels good so far. I will update about how long it takes this product to heal incredibly damaged cracked peeling lips (sounds gross and it is, but doesn&#x27;t look awful with chapstick on). Also, in someone else&#x27;s review (the only non-5 star) there was a comment about it leaving your lips whitish and gross looking. This had me worried cause I could visualize how nasty mine might look. Luckily I found that statement to be untrue... maybe if you load it on and don&#x27;t even purse your lips together then it would look gross, but for me even with crazy chapped lips the whiteness goes away just by pressing your lips together one time. Leaves my lips looking shiny and feeling taken care of.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective lip balm I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s slick AND stays on your lips for a long time. I can put it on and not think about it or if I need more.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  It is great for chapped lips or any other problem your lips may have</li>
            <li> Too thick on the lip and leaves white residue . Not worth buying</li>
            <li> Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I live in Alaska. The air in the winter is freezing cold and as dry as a desert!&lt;br /&gt;* I used other lip balms constantly (I mean like every half hour all day!) and have tried all of them but my lips still cracked and bled.&lt;br /&gt;* This stuff works instantly and my lips don&#x27;t crack anymore.&lt;br /&gt;* It is expensive but it will last a long time and it&#x27;s definitely worth it! I am a frugal person and this is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;* It is a little hard to get out, keep it in your pocket and when it is warm it comes out easier.&lt;br /&gt;* I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it turning my lips white, these people are probably using too much. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;* I usually get it from a urgent care clinic (yes, you read that right) but the lady was out of it. I get if for $12 there so one dollar more here isn&#x27;t too bad!&lt;br /&gt;* Complaint: It&#x27;s been 10 days and I still haven&#x27;t received it! However, the sender did send it a day after I ordered it so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously life-changing. This is the ONLY lip balm I use now!</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that really works for my dry lips.  I ran out and tried other products before I re-ordered this and there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> I dont usually take time to endorse products, but I think this product deserves a minute of my time. I have been dealing with dry lips for as long as I can remember. In just few days, this product appears to have reversed several years of damage. it does go on white, but it blends with lip gloss well</li>
            <li> I have chapped lips all year long.  When i use this religiously, i can get my lips healed and smooth.  Can&#x27;t be without this.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  My lips are finally soft.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I tend to avoid buying over-priced \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products--especially when there are usually comparable products available at a fraction of the price.  However, I embarked on a desperate search for a miracle lip balm, because my lips were beyond chapped.  They were completely dried out, cracked, and frequently bled.  Basically, my lips were in really bad shape and it got to the point where I became extremely self-conscious about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried lots of different lip balms during my desperation.  Failed attempts to repair my lips include, but are not limited to: [[ASIN:B0041QW1UG EOS Tangerine Medicated Lip Balm Sphere, .25-Ounce (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B004AIECQG Chapstick Lip Balm Medicated, 0.15 oz (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B00119YPS2 Blistex lip medex, lip moisturizer - 12 x 0.25 oz]], [[ASIN:B001ARJGXY Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm Lemon &amp; Chamomile]], [[ASIN:B0055OLROE Neosporin Lip Health Overnight Renewal Therapy, 0.27 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]], [[ASIN:B000S97NUS Kiehls - Lip Balm #1 - Tube - .5oz..]], [[ASIN:B005CPZK26 Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer, SPF 15, 0.15 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], and many others... Of these, Jack Black Intense Lip Therapy seemed to work the best, but I still wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled with the results. (and many of the others didn&#x27;t work at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across Qtica, I was impressed by the volume of very positive reviews, but I was still reluctant to pull the trigger, because (as a guy) I thought that the price was insane for a tiny tube of lip balm.  Desperation eventually got the better of me, and I decided to buy Qtica (and paid nearly twice the price of anything that I had previously tried)...  Ultimately, it was the BEST money that I have ever spent on lip care.  I put a thick coat of Qtica Lip Repair Balm on over night, and when I woke up the next morning I immediately saw results.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my gross lips hadn&#x27;t completely healed after one nighttime application, but the results were definitely visible.  I continued to apply the stuff about 3-4 times a day (including a thick coat before bed), and after my first full week of use, my embarrassingly damaged lips had almost completely healed.  By the end of the following week, my lips looked soft, healthy and quite kissable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, this lip balm is absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s well worth the money and I can&#x27;t praise Qtica enough.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive lip balm... But if your lips are damaged, don&#x27;t let the price deter you.  Rather than buying lots of less expensive (and less effective) products, just buy this... You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
