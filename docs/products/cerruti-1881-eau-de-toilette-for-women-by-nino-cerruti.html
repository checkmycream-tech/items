            <li> I used to buy this in Europe but I was unable to find it in stores in the U.S., so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It smells just as expected, fresh and floral, a very good summer perfume.</li>

            <li> She was very happy with her gift</li>
            <li> Very feminine scent. People ask me all the time what fragrance I  use. I&#x27;ve been using Cerruti for over 16 years.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a female friend. It was just what I was looking for and wanted and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Darn.  Ever smell something wonderful on someone else only to find that it smells like bug spray on you?  Well that&#x27;s my experience with 1881.  I wanted to much to like it, but it was very cloying and really did smell like &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; bug spray.  I finally pronounced it a loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. It is my go to perfume. Perfect for a working perofessional. Not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I make sure I never run out of this cologne.  It is good that I can order it before I run out!</li>
            <li> very nice scent ,not heavy ,last about 6 hours ,i have had the version for man and i liked that one as well ,and now this is my new favorite ,</li>
            <li> Great. I received this product quickly and I nie have my favorite cologne again</li>
            <li> My favorite since many years!!! Shipping took some time but when it arrived I was very pleased :)</li>
