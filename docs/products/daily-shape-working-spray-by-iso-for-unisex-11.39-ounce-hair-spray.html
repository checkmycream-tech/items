            <li>Great hold without looking stuck to your head or sticky.</li>
            <li>And has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair spray.</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>My favorite hair spray!</li>
            <li>This spray is not too sticky but holds really nicely and gives my hair body.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase this as it really does work nice!!</li>
            <li>Love this spray - been ordering it for years.</li>
            <li>What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>You are able to spray your hair and still style if need be...</li>
            <li>the can - this has happened on more than one can.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Used most of the can of hairspray trying to pull the nozzle out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and keeps my unruly hair in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather light though, so don&#x27;t expect your hair to &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; in place.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, with no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t coat your hair with sticky.  </li>
            <li>Great hairspray, I was worried that the nozzle would have issues as stated by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Great for fine hair; doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or build up over a couple of days but keeps a gentle hold.  </li>
            <li>It is excellent for thin hair, it really allows you to style and set your hair with it.</li>
            <li>I tried running the nozzle under hot water</li>
            <li>Great to use when styling dry hair and using a curling iron/wand or flat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not sticky or stiff, yet holds my fine, straight hair when I can be bothered to curl it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this hairspray holds well without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li>iron- also adds some body to my fine long hair and gives added shine.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It still works, but sometimes I have to stop the spray by pulling the spray nozzle out by hand - little tricky :).</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m looking for a new hairspray.</li>
            <li>Daily Shape by ISO is light enough to move my hair after it&#x27;s sprayed.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and does not dry out your hair and no bluid up.</li>
            <li>like as much ISO Daily Shape.</li>
            <li>No issues here, and it sprays rather wide, unlike the more narrow sprays out there.</li>
            <li>No other hairspray compares.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser first recommended it few years ago</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a faithful user for at least 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I did contact the company and was sent 1 replacement can of spray, but I&#x27;m always afraid it will happen again.  </li>

            <li> A product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and crunchy with any residue!! Great to use when styling dry hair and using a curling iron/wand or flat iron- also adds some body to my fine long hair and gives added shine. I am not big on strong fragrances, and this one isn&#x27;t too bad, but there is a scent that lingers in my hair long after spraying it. Will continue to purchase this as it really does work nice!!</li>
            <li> It works very well and does not dry out your hair and no bluid up.</li>
            <li> Love this spray - been ordering it for years. It&#x27;s light and keeps my unruly hair in place. My hairdresser first recommended it few years ago and I have been using it ever since</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Daily Shape by ISO is light enough to move my hair after it&#x27;s sprayed.  Yet it holds my style in place all day.  Does a great job of holding in humid weather and rain.  Makes my hair shine.  And has a pleasant scent.  What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I ever purchase.  My hairdresser introduced it to me.  It is excellent for thin hair, it really allows you to style and set your hair with it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  It&#x27;s light, not sticky or stiff, yet holds my fine, straight hair when I can be bothered to curl it.  The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is that I had issues with 2 different cans where the spray wouldn&#x27;t stop!  I had to put them out on the deck and just let them spray until empty.  I did contact the company and was sent 1 replacement can of spray, but I&#x27;m always afraid it will happen again.  Never had this issue with any other aerosol can.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair spray. You are able to spray your hair and still style if need be... It does not make you hair stiff or sticky. Smells great!!</li>
            <li> Great hold without looking stuck to your head or sticky.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, I was worried that the nozzle would have issues as stated by other reviewers. No issues here, and it sprays rather wide, unlike the more narrow sprays out there. It&#x27;s rather light though, so don&#x27;t expect your hair to &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; in place.</li>
            <li> Not an especially noteworthy product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or stiff and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.  Only problem I have is with the spray nozzle sticking after using about 1/2 the can - this has happened on more than one can.  It still works, but sometimes I have to stop the spray by pulling the spray nozzle out by hand - little tricky :).</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray, works well and it&#x27;s light hold.  This spray is not too sticky but holds really nicely and gives my hair body.  I recommend it but it does slightly irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair; doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or build up over a couple of days but keeps a gentle hold.  Also doesn&#x27;t stick to curling iron. My favorite!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  I have never found a hair finishing product&lt;br /&gt;I like as much ISO Daily Shape. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray.  I&#x27;ve been a faithful user for at least 6 years.  I have very fine hair and this hairspray holds well without weighing down my hair.  Unfortunately, the last 2 cans I purchased were defective.  After using each can for about 1/4-1/2 of the can, the nozzle started sticking and you would manually have to pull it back out.  I tried running the nozzle under hot water but this was no help.  Used most of the can of hairspray trying to pull the nozzle out.  Now, I&#x27;m looking for a new hairspray.</li>
            <li> This hairspray holds well without a sticky feeling in my hair. My hair stylist uses this and recommends it to everyone</li>
            <li> No other hairspray compares.  It&#x27;s light, with no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t coat your hair with sticky.  Best ever for both men and women!</li>
