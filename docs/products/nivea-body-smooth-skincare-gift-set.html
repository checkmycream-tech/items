    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome deal!</li>
            <li>I especially love the lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful gift set for the price.  </li>
            <li>, and it soaped up wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>body wash was everything I was hoping it would be, soothing and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>These all come in a very nice tin, perfect for those Christmas cookies</li>
            <li>And this comes packaged in a very nice tin - perfect for keeping and reusing.</li>
            <li>Very nice set and as always great products!</li>
            <li>The package is beautiful and well thought out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is beautifully boxed.</li>
            <li>Great value and would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>I know this is really a great brand so for me this is a great transaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and gives you a great lather with just a dollop on the shower puff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the lip balm was great.</li>
            <li>set is quite attractive.</li>
            <li>This would make a great gift for a teacher, coworker or family member.  </li>
            <li>think this will make a great gift.</li>
            <li>It also is great for shaving your legs.  </li>
            <li>I think the Nivea Skincare Gift Set is a great option for gifting.</li>
            <li>Great gift set, even though i got it for myself.</li>
            <li>But the lotion and cream are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Point-by-point, item-by-item, the lotion, while pleasant smelling, is a bit strange-feeling.</li>
            <li>thought it might also make a good coworker gift, but I don&#x27;t want the bodywash to say &amp;</li>
            <li>Nivea is a brand name known for quality, and this set is a good representation of that quality</li>
            <li>Nivea is a trusted name in my family for products that are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Body Smooth Skincare Gift Set is a great value!  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s pleasantly moisturizing while still cleansing, I&#x27;m finding myself pairing it more and more with shower gels that have a more pleasant scent, but a tendency to strip my skin, in order to get a perfect combination of cleaning and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the body wash and the lotion have a sweet and very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturizes for an extended period, the body-wash is nice and the lip moisturizer is also very pleasant to use--goes on incredibly smoothly.</li>
            <li>The container is very cute and has tissue paper inside wrapping the lotions and lip butter gifts inside.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Nivea products, and the price of this set makes it a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>; but instead I thought the scent was more like deodorant soap or laundry detergent!</li>
            <li>we like the set, but it&#x27;s nothing amazing.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm kind of just caked on my lips.</li>
            <li>Then she used the tin to hold a puzzle where the box was falling apart--it&#x27;s nice sturdy tin that isn&#x27;t marred by logos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging - the tin is nice, and reusable, but I don&#x27;t know that I would keep it.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm glides on nicely and lasts for quite a while - I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li>Decorative container is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>However, the gift set was nicely packaged in a sturdy tin.</li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>The shower gel was just as nice and doesn&#x27;t have a cloying, overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I might decide that I need a gift of my own from Santa.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a nice set.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and sturdy, and all three products are things almost anyone could use.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice gift.  </li>
            <li>All three smell nice.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a nice set, quite affordable at the time of this review (&amp;#60;10 dlls)</li>
            <li>This is a nice set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products, and these 3 items are no exception.</li>
            <li>This is a nicely packaged gift set that comes with body wash, lotion, and lip balm.</li>
            <li>I happen to love shea butter, so it hit a good spot with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it will be nice for reuse.</li>
            <li>These are high quality products at a bargain price and this makes a perfect gift for a friend, co-worker, or family member.</li>
            <li>The scent of the lotion is light like the body wash but pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>body wash has a very light scent, a combination of tea Rose and almond.</li>
            <li>But if you know someone who is a fan this is a great gift package and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the beautiful tin first got my attention</li>
            <li>At less than $10, this gift set is a great value and excellent as a Holiday gift.</li>
            <li>The lotion is the best for sure, for it is easy to spread and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>The lotion is lovely, has a pleasant clean smell and made my shin feel silky, not sticky.</li>
            <li>Both the body wash and the body lotion have a mild and pleasant fragrance and perform their intended functions well.  </li>
            <li>It smells like Nivea cream but with a very light flowery scent - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>#34;I think you should shower more...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic gift set for the upcoming holiday gift season!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not marred by any type which makes it even more usable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a couple more myself to give to my mother-in-law and a couple of coworkers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others might find that these Nivea products are just what they were hoping for, which is why I didn&#x27;t ding this set for more stars...</li>
            <li>Maybe this set would be better suited to him, or someone else...</li>
            <li>The three skincare products come in a lovely, decorative tin.  </li>
            <li>The tube is more like a lipstick one, and the product itself is not as waxy as  </li>
            <li>And this set is at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I Love the body wash.</li>
            <li>It smells wondering and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The body wash and lotion have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger forever.</li>
            <li>It personally didn&#x27;t work the best for me based on the fact that I needed lotion and lip balm that lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin more so during winter and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and it is easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>It has an easy got open top, lathers nicely, and is a great body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly with a nice light feeling and absorbs fast, but still makes my skin feel like there is something there (in a good way).  </li>
            <li>lotion is light but feels more greasy than I prefer.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the smooth sensations body lotion with Shea butter and hydra IQ.</li>
            <li>But, since I enjoy giving gifts that will be enjoyed, I tested the ingredients as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light scent that I really like (the bottle says Tea Rose Blossom and Almond Essence, but neither overpowers, so</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is perfect - it&#x27;s not too thin/runny or thick/greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t familiar with these products so of course I had to try them out to make sure I was giving a quality gift.</li>
            <li>Balm - Sealed shut with a part of the label that can be torn off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm goes on easily and does feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Nivea products and this is a great set to give someone at Christmas or as an everyday gift.</li>
            <li>I think the main reason I kept it at 4 stars instead of dropping to three is because it&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
            <li>The body lotion has a bit of a stronger scent, but still not too strong.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t a full almond scent, but it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li>it is a nice blended scent, almost like a perfume I had a long time ago that I loved, but can&#x27;t remember what it was).  </li>
            <li>I am quite sensitive to scents, and this one is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>So why not get the rest of the gift set for basically free?</li>
            <li>This is a light lotion (as opposed to the heavier ones that take forever to soak into your skin).  </li>
            <li>so I decided to give this Nivea Body Smooth Gift set a whirl.</li>
            <li>The items really need some kind of cardboard inside the tin to hold the products in place and protect their tin.</li>
            <li>The lip balm glides on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip care item is fortunately unscented and also has no flavor that I can detect.  </li>
            <li>It is really light weight.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and hydrates my lips well but</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this set if you are looking for moisturizing products that are really light.</li>
            <li>However some folks may really enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>The lotion makes your skin really soft and I love the lip balm which will come in handy at this time of year.</li>
            <li>It is very big and will be very handy holding something besides what came in it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s always nice to give something pretty and useful and this one is both</li>
            <li>The blue tin is attractive and is reusable – great for keeping cookies and similar items fresh.  </li>
            <li>I could see this as being great for a Christmas or birthday gift for someone who can use an excuse to pamper herself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for someone who wants sun protection, as well as a light coating that leaves your lips soft.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and rinses off cleanly - overall, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and again, mild scent.  </li>
            <li>An easy to open top, not my favorite product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She enjoyed it but said that she doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of the moisturizer</li>
            <li>:) I think you kinda have to know someone likes Nivea products before the gift would be really</li>
            <li>Overall, a good gift for the price.</li>
            <li>The lotion is cool too.</li>
            <li>It came with a big container of body wash which leaves your skin tingling and makes you feel so good.</li>
            <li>The tin this comes in is very nice, a pretty blue color with no writing on it</li>
            <li>As for the gift tin, it&#x27;s sized right to fit all three items in.  </li>
            <li>Inside is a large bottle of body wash with a very strong floral perfume, a small lotion bottle that smells kind of indistinctly perfumey--reminded me of Avon stuff--and a tube of lip balm with an SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not at all fond of the scent of these items, and the scent is very, very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen lip moisturizer absorbs quickly, works best under a regular lipstick (extra protection if</li>
            <li>Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash Mild Refill, Cherry Almond - 16 Oz]]</li>
            <li>Wash, nice big bottle, nice light scent, does not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good reputation, and I have used their Nivea cream for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scents are very mild in all three products, I really like that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite body wash, a really fast absorbing, nicely scented lotion and who doesn&#x27;t need a nice plain lip balm?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Body wash - Easy to open flip top.  </li>
            <li>- Easy open flip top.  </li>
            <li>This is a really fun gift set just in time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>so I feel that the cost is worth it.  </li>
            <li>body wash leaves skin feeling soft, with a scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The tin that the products come in is nice and could definitely be reused to store products.</li>
            <li>lotion absorbed well in my hands, and on my legs where I used it.</li>
            <li>I originally put too much on</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip balm is pleasant but does feel slightly heavier than my preferred lip balms.</li>
            <li>You can take the wrapper off and tie a bow around the tin for a lovely present.  </li>
            <li>From the first application, I noticed smoother hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of lotions, lip balms, and shower gels, and swear I could run a store out of my house, considering the mass quantities of each that I keep in stock in my home, but the contents of this set, I&#x27;m just not so sure about...</li>
            <li>that I remember Febreze having when it first came on the market.</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing this gift set only if you are really sure about the tastes of the recipient.</li>
            <li>The products all work well to hydrate and smooth skin and are not highly fragranced which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>The body wash has a feminine tea rose blossom and almond scent, which is a light scent and not overpowering or long lasting.</li>
            <li>The lotion, although not in as strikingly huge a bottle as the body wash presents in, in true Nivea fashion, works so well that you don&#x27;t need to glop on a ton of it for your skin to stay hydrated all day, so I&#x27;m finding that the bottle provided is going a long way.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm has a pleasant feel with no color and no overwhelming or distracting scent and is also a large helping.  </li>
            <li>cherry on the top of this gift set, aside from the high quality products, is the blue gift tin.</li>
            <li>Especially, the skin lotion absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>body wash comes in a large container.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled that it didn&#x27;t irritate my dry sensitive skin also.</li>
            <li>She does really like the bodywash.</li>
            <li>There are no brand markings though, so really, it can be used to make another gift pack for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scent is Shea Butter, but once I put it on and rub it in, I don&#x27;t really notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed a scent, and there isn&#x27;t one listed, although within the ingredient list, there is &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really put my finger on it.  </li>
            <li>In the set, you get a 16.9 ounce bottle of Nivea Touch of Smoothness Body Wash, a 6.8 ounce bottle of Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, a .17 ounce Lip Care balm, and a sturdy blue tin to hold it all.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is very similar to Chapstick in that it has that waxy consistency to it and has an SPF 15 in it as well, so it protects your lips from sunburn and chapping and keeps them smooth and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this skincare set.  </li>
            <li>so I was concerned about too much perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much greasy as it is overly gel-y: kinda slimy, and feels like it just won&#x27;t fully absorb in.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>The body wash definitely moisturizers and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The body wash and skin lotion have a pleasant subtle scent, and do the job well.</li>
            <li>With products that most everyone can use including a useful keepsake tin for storage, I have no doubt the young lady in your life will appreciate the Nivea Gift Set either as a holiday present or other special</li>
            <li>So I see this lotion as more of a task-friendly lotion, in other words, you can put it on and don&#x27;t need to wait 5-10 minutes for the slippery feeling to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip</li>
            <li>lip balm, while hyper-moisturizing feeling with the initial touch to one&#x27;s lips, just doesn&#x27;t seem to seal moisture in like my coveted Burt&#x27;s Bees (original) lip balm does.</li>
            <li>For sun protection it will probably work great, but for everyday moisturizing for my dry lips not so much.</li>
            <li>This lovely gift set of body wash, lotion and lip balm comes in a nice blue and white reusable round metal tin.  </li>
            <li>The outside said moisturizing which I found wasn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yep, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure who on my list deserves this one, and I can&#x27;t promise that it&#x27;s going anywhere.</li>
            <li>Not bad enough to make me want to quite using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip Balm:&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty blue and white design with no branding or ingredient information anywhere on it, so you could actually use it as its own gift wrapping-</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Nivea Skincare Gift Set to everyone.</li>
            <li>The lip balm goes on smooth, with no real tint, so you can wear this under lipstick without it changing the color of it.  </li>
            <li>If you like the bodywash, it&#x27;s normally over $10 for this size bottle.</li>
            <li>The tin has no brand markings, so I store different things in it and find it useful.</li>
            <li>This set makes for a thoughtful and actually USEFUL small gift.</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my skin right away, but I found it to leave a slight residue on the palms on my hands.</li>
            <li>She feels like the lip balm makes her lips actually feel more dry!</li>
            <li>Nivea in new to me as a product, with the exception of the lip balm.</li>
            <li>A very soft almond scent is discovered in both of the lotions, the moisturizing body wash and  body lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the body wash consistently for several weeks, and have used the lip balm and lotion some.</li>
            <li>The products come in a nicely-sized, pretty, blue gift tin.  </li>
            <li>just add a pretty white or silver bow, and you&#x27;d be set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think there is one major problem with a collection like this as a gift--people have a lot of personal preferences for these items and rarely go for one brand for all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This just doesn&#x27;t seem like the old Nivea smell and it doesn&#x27;t say it is new, improved or scented.  </li>
            <li>For super-dry areas like the heels of my feet and my elbows, it&#x27;s good, but for my hands and other less desert-like areas, it&#x27;s just too much moisture, and takes too long to rub in</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin soft too.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the items in this skincare gift set.</li>
            <li>As a fan of Almond (remember the old Jergens lotion?)</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at the size of this tin.</li>
            <li>The tin would probably hold at least 2 dozen cookies, maybe more.</li>
            <li>My only main problem with this is the scent.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I won&#x27;t be buying these again for myself, although I have considered some of the items from this set for my older father, who&#x27;s always complaining of stripped-feeling skin after showers with regular gels.</li>
            <li>The Nivea touch of smoothness body wash has a rose smell as well that is included (not something I usually lean towards) but it is light,feminine, and does not seem to last too long.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a film of thick soap, just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to have one that isn&#x27;t waxy and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste after use as well as providing  sun</li>
            <li>The lip balm is also smooth and not at all waxy or thick.</li>
            <li>It even has a pretty blue metal container, which you can use to store other things after taking out the three products.  </li>
            <li>heavy waxy feeling, I checked the ingredients one of the first one&#x27;s was wax.  </li>

            <li> Awesome deal!</li>
            <li> I especially love the lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful gift set for the price.  </li>
            <li> , and it soaped up wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> body wash was everything I was hoping it would be, soothing and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> These all come in a very nice tin, perfect for those Christmas cookies</li>
            <li> And this comes packaged in a very nice tin - perfect for keeping and reusing.</li>
            <li> Very nice set and as always great products!</li>
            <li> The package is beautiful and well thought out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is beautifully boxed.</li>
            <li> Great value and would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I know this is really a great brand so for me this is a great transaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and gives you a great lather with just a dollop on the shower puff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the lip balm was great.</li>
            <li> set is quite attractive.</li>
            <li> This would make a great gift for a teacher, coworker or family member.  </li>
            <li> think this will make a great gift.</li>
            <li> It also is great for shaving your legs.  </li>
            <li> I think the Nivea Skincare Gift Set is a great option for gifting.</li>
            <li> Great gift set, even though i got it for myself.</li>
            <li> But the lotion and cream are great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Point-by-point, item-by-item, the lotion, while pleasant smelling, is a bit strange-feeling.</li>
            <li> thought it might also make a good coworker gift, but I don&#x27;t want the bodywash to say &amp;</li>
            <li> Nivea is a brand name known for quality, and this set is a good representation of that quality</li>
            <li> Nivea is a trusted name in my family for products that are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Body Smooth Skincare Gift Set is a great value!  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s pleasantly moisturizing while still cleansing, I&#x27;m finding myself pairing it more and more with shower gels that have a more pleasant scent, but a tendency to strip my skin, in order to get a perfect combination of cleaning and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the body wash and the lotion have a sweet and very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturizes for an extended period, the body-wash is nice and the lip moisturizer is also very pleasant to use--goes on incredibly smoothly.</li>
            <li> The container is very cute and has tissue paper inside wrapping the lotions and lip butter gifts inside.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Nivea products, and the price of this set makes it a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> ; but instead I thought the scent was more like deodorant soap or laundry detergent!</li>
            <li> we like the set, but it&#x27;s nothing amazing.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm kind of just caked on my lips.</li>
            <li> Then she used the tin to hold a puzzle where the box was falling apart--it&#x27;s nice sturdy tin that isn&#x27;t marred by logos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging - the tin is nice, and reusable, but I don&#x27;t know that I would keep it.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm glides on nicely and lasts for quite a while - I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li> Decorative container is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> However, the gift set was nicely packaged in a sturdy tin.</li>
            <li> Nice set.</li>
            <li> The shower gel was just as nice and doesn&#x27;t have a cloying, overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I might decide that I need a gift of my own from Santa.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a nice set.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and sturdy, and all three products are things almost anyone could use.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice gift.  </li>
            <li> All three smell nice.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a nice set, quite affordable at the time of this review (&amp;#60;10 dlls)</li>
            <li> This is a nice set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products, and these 3 items are no exception.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely packaged gift set that comes with body wash, lotion, and lip balm.</li>
            <li> I happen to love shea butter, so it hit a good spot with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it will be nice for reuse.</li>
            <li> These are high quality products at a bargain price and this makes a perfect gift for a friend, co-worker, or family member.</li>
            <li> The scent of the lotion is light like the body wash but pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> body wash has a very light scent, a combination of tea Rose and almond.</li>
            <li> But if you know someone who is a fan this is a great gift package and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the beautiful tin first got my attention</li>
            <li> At less than $10, this gift set is a great value and excellent as a Holiday gift.</li>
            <li> The lotion is the best for sure, for it is easy to spread and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> The lotion is lovely, has a pleasant clean smell and made my shin feel silky, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Both the body wash and the body lotion have a mild and pleasant fragrance and perform their intended functions well.  </li>
            <li> It smells like Nivea cream but with a very light flowery scent - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> #34;I think you should shower more...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic gift set for the upcoming holiday gift season!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not marred by any type which makes it even more usable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a couple more myself to give to my mother-in-law and a couple of coworkers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others might find that these Nivea products are just what they were hoping for, which is why I didn&#x27;t ding this set for more stars...</li>
            <li> Maybe this set would be better suited to him, or someone else...</li>
            <li> The three skincare products come in a lovely, decorative tin.  </li>
            <li> The tube is more like a lipstick one, and the product itself is not as waxy as  </li>
            <li> And this set is at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I Love the body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells wondering and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The body wash and lotion have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger forever.</li>
            <li> It personally didn&#x27;t work the best for me based on the fact that I needed lotion and lip balm that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin more so during winter and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and it is easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li> It has an easy got open top, lathers nicely, and is a great body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with a nice light feeling and absorbs fast, but still makes my skin feel like there is something there (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> lotion is light but feels more greasy than I prefer.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the smooth sensations body lotion with Shea butter and hydra IQ.</li>
            <li> But, since I enjoy giving gifts that will be enjoyed, I tested the ingredients as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light scent that I really like (the bottle says Tea Rose Blossom and Almond Essence, but neither overpowers, so</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is perfect - it&#x27;s not too thin/runny or thick/greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t familiar with these products so of course I had to try them out to make sure I was giving a quality gift.</li>
            <li> Balm - Sealed shut with a part of the label that can be torn off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm goes on easily and does feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Nivea products and this is a great set to give someone at Christmas or as an everyday gift.</li>
            <li> I think the main reason I kept it at 4 stars instead of dropping to three is because it&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
            <li> The body lotion has a bit of a stronger scent, but still not too strong.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a full almond scent, but it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li> it is a nice blended scent, almost like a perfume I had a long time ago that I loved, but can&#x27;t remember what it was).  </li>
            <li> I am quite sensitive to scents, and this one is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> So why not get the rest of the gift set for basically free?</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion (as opposed to the heavier ones that take forever to soak into your skin).  </li>
            <li> so I decided to give this Nivea Body Smooth Gift set a whirl.</li>
            <li> The items really need some kind of cardboard inside the tin to hold the products in place and protect their tin.</li>
            <li> The lip balm glides on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip care item is fortunately unscented and also has no flavor that I can detect.  </li>
            <li> It is really light weight.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and hydrates my lips well but</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this set if you are looking for moisturizing products that are really light.</li>
            <li> However some folks may really enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li> The lotion makes your skin really soft and I love the lip balm which will come in handy at this time of year.</li>
            <li> It is very big and will be very handy holding something besides what came in it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s always nice to give something pretty and useful and this one is both</li>
            <li> The blue tin is attractive and is reusable – great for keeping cookies and similar items fresh.  </li>
            <li> I could see this as being great for a Christmas or birthday gift for someone who can use an excuse to pamper herself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for someone who wants sun protection, as well as a light coating that leaves your lips soft.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and rinses off cleanly - overall, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and again, mild scent.  </li>
            <li> An easy to open top, not my favorite product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She enjoyed it but said that she doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of the moisturizer</li>
            <li> :) I think you kinda have to know someone likes Nivea products before the gift would be really</li>
            <li> Overall, a good gift for the price.</li>
            <li> The lotion is cool too.</li>
            <li> It came with a big container of body wash which leaves your skin tingling and makes you feel so good.</li>
            <li> The tin this comes in is very nice, a pretty blue color with no writing on it</li>
            <li> As for the gift tin, it&#x27;s sized right to fit all three items in.  </li>
            <li> Inside is a large bottle of body wash with a very strong floral perfume, a small lotion bottle that smells kind of indistinctly perfumey--reminded me of Avon stuff--and a tube of lip balm with an SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not at all fond of the scent of these items, and the scent is very, very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen lip moisturizer absorbs quickly, works best under a regular lipstick (extra protection if</li>
            <li> Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash Mild Refill, Cherry Almond - 16 Oz]]</li>
            <li> Wash, nice big bottle, nice light scent, does not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good reputation, and I have used their Nivea cream for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scents are very mild in all three products, I really like that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite body wash, a really fast absorbing, nicely scented lotion and who doesn&#x27;t need a nice plain lip balm?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Body wash - Easy to open flip top.  </li>
            <li> - Easy open flip top.  </li>
            <li> This is a really fun gift set just in time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> so I feel that the cost is worth it.  </li>
            <li> body wash leaves skin feeling soft, with a scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The tin that the products come in is nice and could definitely be reused to store products.</li>
            <li> lotion absorbed well in my hands, and on my legs where I used it.</li>
            <li> I originally put too much on</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip balm is pleasant but does feel slightly heavier than my preferred lip balms.</li>
            <li> You can take the wrapper off and tie a bow around the tin for a lovely present.  </li>
            <li> From the first application, I noticed smoother hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of lotions, lip balms, and shower gels, and swear I could run a store out of my house, considering the mass quantities of each that I keep in stock in my home, but the contents of this set, I&#x27;m just not so sure about...</li>
            <li> that I remember Febreze having when it first came on the market.</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing this gift set only if you are really sure about the tastes of the recipient.</li>
            <li> The products all work well to hydrate and smooth skin and are not highly fragranced which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> The body wash has a feminine tea rose blossom and almond scent, which is a light scent and not overpowering or long lasting.</li>
            <li> The lotion, although not in as strikingly huge a bottle as the body wash presents in, in true Nivea fashion, works so well that you don&#x27;t need to glop on a ton of it for your skin to stay hydrated all day, so I&#x27;m finding that the bottle provided is going a long way.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm has a pleasant feel with no color and no overwhelming or distracting scent and is also a large helping.  </li>
            <li> cherry on the top of this gift set, aside from the high quality products, is the blue gift tin.</li>
            <li> Especially, the skin lotion absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> body wash comes in a large container.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled that it didn&#x27;t irritate my dry sensitive skin also.</li>
            <li> She does really like the bodywash.</li>
            <li> There are no brand markings though, so really, it can be used to make another gift pack for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scent is Shea Butter, but once I put it on and rub it in, I don&#x27;t really notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a scent, and there isn&#x27;t one listed, although within the ingredient list, there is &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put my finger on it.  </li>
            <li> In the set, you get a 16.9 ounce bottle of Nivea Touch of Smoothness Body Wash, a 6.8 ounce bottle of Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, a .17 ounce Lip Care balm, and a sturdy blue tin to hold it all.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is very similar to Chapstick in that it has that waxy consistency to it and has an SPF 15 in it as well, so it protects your lips from sunburn and chapping and keeps them smooth and</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this skincare set.  </li>
            <li> so I was concerned about too much perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much greasy as it is overly gel-y: kinda slimy, and feels like it just won&#x27;t fully absorb in.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> The body wash definitely moisturizers and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The body wash and skin lotion have a pleasant subtle scent, and do the job well.</li>
            <li> With products that most everyone can use including a useful keepsake tin for storage, I have no doubt the young lady in your life will appreciate the Nivea Gift Set either as a holiday present or other special</li>
            <li> So I see this lotion as more of a task-friendly lotion, in other words, you can put it on and don&#x27;t need to wait 5-10 minutes for the slippery feeling to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip</li>
            <li> lip balm, while hyper-moisturizing feeling with the initial touch to one&#x27;s lips, just doesn&#x27;t seem to seal moisture in like my coveted Burt&#x27;s Bees (original) lip balm does.</li>
            <li> For sun protection it will probably work great, but for everyday moisturizing for my dry lips not so much.</li>
            <li> This lovely gift set of body wash, lotion and lip balm comes in a nice blue and white reusable round metal tin.  </li>
            <li> The outside said moisturizing which I found wasn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yep, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure who on my list deserves this one, and I can&#x27;t promise that it&#x27;s going anywhere.</li>
            <li> Not bad enough to make me want to quite using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip Balm:&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty blue and white design with no branding or ingredient information anywhere on it, so you could actually use it as its own gift wrapping-</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Nivea Skincare Gift Set to everyone.</li>
            <li> The lip balm goes on smooth, with no real tint, so you can wear this under lipstick without it changing the color of it.  </li>
            <li> If you like the bodywash, it&#x27;s normally over $10 for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> The tin has no brand markings, so I store different things in it and find it useful.</li>
            <li> This set makes for a thoughtful and actually USEFUL small gift.</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my skin right away, but I found it to leave a slight residue on the palms on my hands.</li>
            <li> She feels like the lip balm makes her lips actually feel more dry!</li>
            <li> Nivea in new to me as a product, with the exception of the lip balm.</li>
            <li> A very soft almond scent is discovered in both of the lotions, the moisturizing body wash and  body lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the body wash consistently for several weeks, and have used the lip balm and lotion some.</li>
            <li> The products come in a nicely-sized, pretty, blue gift tin.  </li>
            <li> just add a pretty white or silver bow, and you&#x27;d be set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think there is one major problem with a collection like this as a gift--people have a lot of personal preferences for these items and rarely go for one brand for all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t seem like the old Nivea smell and it doesn&#x27;t say it is new, improved or scented.  </li>
            <li> For super-dry areas like the heels of my feet and my elbows, it&#x27;s good, but for my hands and other less desert-like areas, it&#x27;s just too much moisture, and takes too long to rub in</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin soft too.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the items in this skincare gift set.</li>
            <li> As a fan of Almond (remember the old Jergens lotion?)</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at the size of this tin.</li>
            <li> The tin would probably hold at least 2 dozen cookies, maybe more.</li>
            <li> My only main problem with this is the scent.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I won&#x27;t be buying these again for myself, although I have considered some of the items from this set for my older father, who&#x27;s always complaining of stripped-feeling skin after showers with regular gels.</li>
            <li> The Nivea touch of smoothness body wash has a rose smell as well that is included (not something I usually lean towards) but it is light,feminine, and does not seem to last too long.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a film of thick soap, just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great to have one that isn&#x27;t waxy and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste after use as well as providing  sun</li>
            <li> The lip balm is also smooth and not at all waxy or thick.</li>
            <li> It even has a pretty blue metal container, which you can use to store other things after taking out the three products.  </li>
            <li> heavy waxy feeling, I checked the ingredients one of the first one&#x27;s was wax.  </li>
            <li> This goes on super slick and almost wet feeling, it&#x27;s got such a seemingly high level of moisture, but 20 minutes later, I find myself reapplying it because my lips just stay somewhat dried out feeling...</li>
            <li> shower gel is supposed to have a white tea rose sort of scent, but instead it smells hyper-sterile and chemically to me, with that unpleasant &amp;#34;hospital</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will review these separately&lt;br /&gt;Body Wash, nice big bottle, nice light scent, does not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Lotion, small bottle, but a little goes a long way.  It absorbed into my skin right away, but I found it to leave a slight residue on the palms on my hands. Not bad enough to make me want to quite using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip Balm:&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy waxy feeling, I checked the ingredients one of the first one&#x27;s was wax.  Then I read the label, they suggest this be used as a sunblock for your ilps, so the wax makes sense. The outside said moisturizing which I found wasn&#x27;t true for me. The lip balm kind of just caked on my lips. For sun protection it will probably work great, but for everyday moisturizing for my dry lips not so much.</li>
            <li> The items in this gift set go well together and complement each other. I gave it to my wife. She enjoyed it but said that she doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of the moisturizer--she says it makes her smell like a grandma. She does really like the bodywash. She feels like the lip balm makes her lips actually feel more dry! Then she used the tin to hold a puzzle where the box was falling apart--it&#x27;s nice sturdy tin that isn&#x27;t marred by logos. I think there is one major problem with a collection like this as a gift--people have a lot of personal preferences for these items and rarely go for one brand for all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might also make a good coworker gift, but I don&#x27;t want the bodywash to say &amp;#34;I think you should shower more...&amp;#34;. :) I think you kinda have to know someone likes Nivea products before the gift would be really appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we like the set, but it&#x27;s nothing amazing.  I think the main reason I kept it at 4 stars instead of dropping to three is because it&#x27;s also a good value. If you like the bodywash, it&#x27;s normally over $10 for this size bottle. So why not get the rest of the gift set for basically free?</li>
            <li> This is a really fun gift set just in time for Christmas.  If you have someone who loves lotion/body wash/lip balm, this Nivea kit is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - the tin is nice, and reusable, but I don&#x27;t know that I would keep it.  There are no brand markings though, so really, it can be used to make another gift pack for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body wash - Easy to open flip top.  Very light scent that I really like (the bottle says Tea Rose Blossom and Almond Essence, but neither overpowers, so it is a nice blended scent, almost like a perfume I had a long time ago that I loved, but can&#x27;t remember what it was).  It lathers nicely and rinses off cleanly - overall, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion - Easy open flip top.  Scent is Shea Butter, but once I put it on and rub it in, I don&#x27;t really notice the smell at all.  This is a light lotion (as opposed to the heavier ones that take forever to soak into your skin).  It goes on smoothly with a nice light feeling and absorbs fast, but still makes my skin feel like there is something there (in a good way).  So I see this lotion as more of a task-friendly lotion, in other words, you can put it on and don&#x27;t need to wait 5-10 minutes for the slippery feeling to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip Balm - Sealed shut with a part of the label that can be torn off fairly easily.  Scent - I really haven&#x27;t noticed a scent, and there isn&#x27;t one listed, although within the ingredient list, there is &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  This lip balm glides on nicely and lasts for quite a while - I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great value and would make a great gift. Decorative container is a nice addition. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the body wash consistently for several weeks, and have used the lip balm and lotion some. While I like the gift set, I think there are other brands I would purchase over this one as I just prefer other products. However, the gift set was nicely packaged in a sturdy tin.</li>
            <li> This is only 10 dollars at Kmart!</li>
            <li> I bought this set because of its price. I know this is really a great brand so for me this is a great transaction.</li>
            <li> The package is beautiful and well thought out.  You can take the wrapper off and tie a bow around the tin for a lovely present.  These aren&#x27;t trial sizes so I feel that the cost is worth it.  My only main problem with this is the scent.  This just doesn&#x27;t seem like the old Nivea smell and it doesn&#x27;t say it is new, improved or scented.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell of my skin afterwards.  An artificial soap smell.  I can&#x27;t really put my finger on it.  But if you know someone who is a fan this is a great gift package and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Nice set. The lotion is the best for sure, for it is easy to spread and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! I get this set every year now. It&#x27;s my favorite body wash, a really fast absorbing, nicely scented lotion and who doesn&#x27;t need a nice plain lip balm? The tin has no brand markings, so I store different things in it and find it useful.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic gift set for the upcoming holiday gift season! In the set, you get a 16.9 ounce bottle of Nivea Touch of Smoothness Body Wash, a 6.8 ounce bottle of Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, a .17 ounce Lip Care balm, and a sturdy blue tin to hold it all. The body wash has a feminine tea rose blossom and almond scent, which is a light scent and not overpowering or long lasting. It&#x27;s creamy and gives you a great lather with just a dollop on the shower puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body lotion has shea butter in it which really healed the dry skin I tend to get at this time of year within a few days of using it. The consistency of the lotion is perfect - it&#x27;s not too thin/runny or thick/greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. The scent of the lotion is light like the body wash but pleasant and not overpowering. The lip balm is very similar to Chapstick in that it has that waxy consistency to it and has an SPF 15 in it as well, so it protects your lips from sunburn and chapping and keeps them smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on the top of this gift set, aside from the high quality products, is the blue gift tin. It&#x27;s very large and sturdy and doesn&#x27;t have ugly advertisements/logos on it, so you can use the tin to store anything you want like scrapbooking materials, makeup, Matchbox cars, or even as a cookie tin. I&#x27;m using the tin to store my daughter&#x27;s crayons in. These are high quality products at a bargain price and this makes a perfect gift for a friend, co-worker, or family member. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My family seems to have a tradition of giving lotions and such so I decided to give this Nivea Body Smooth Gift set a whirl. I&#x27;d say the beautiful tin first got my attention, it&#x27;s always nice to give something pretty and useful and this one is both and it&#x27;s not marred by any type which makes it even more usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t familiar with these products so of course I had to try them out to make sure I was giving a quality gift. The lotion is lovely, has a pleasant clean smell and made my shin feel silky, not sticky. The shower gel was just as nice and doesn&#x27;t have a cloying, overpowering scent. I was thrilled that it didn&#x27;t irritate my dry sensitive skin also. And the lip balm was great. I&#x27;m a big fan of lip balms in the winter especially and it&#x27;s great to have one that isn&#x27;t waxy and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste after use as well as providing  sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure who on my list deserves this one, and I can&#x27;t promise that it&#x27;s going anywhere. I might decide that I need a gift of my own from Santa.</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings on this one. I like all the products in this tin--full-sized body wash, lip gloss and lotion. The lotion moisturizes for an extended period, the body-wash is nice and the lip moisturizer is also very pleasant to use--goes on incredibly smoothly. However, the items are just stuck in the tip wrapped in tissue paper. Consequently the tin gets somewhat dented up in shipment. So I like the products, but I would never order this as a gift because I want to give a gift that doesn&#x27;t appear dented up. The items really need some kind of cardboard inside the tin to hold the products in place and protect their tin.</li>
            <li> Nivea is a skin- and body-care brand that is owned by the German companyBeiersdorf. The company was founded on March 28, 1882. The Nivea skin line has been around for a long time. It has a good reputation, and I have used their Nivea cream for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is quite attractive. The three products cane in a blue tin, which I will yes to send Christmas cookies. The set includes a hide wash, body lotion and lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash has a very light scent, a combination of tea Rose and almond. I am quite sensitive to scents, and this one is quite pleasant. It has an easy got open top, lathers nicely, and is a great body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light but feels more greasy than I prefer. It is Shea butter with a slight scent, hardly noticeable.  An easy to open top, not my favorite product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is pleasant but does feel slightly heavier than my preferred lip balms. The lip balm goes on easily and does feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice set. I would use the body wash and the lip balm daily. Nivea is a brand name known for quality, and this set is a good representation of that quality brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 11-06-14</li>
            <li> Nivea is a trusted name in my family for products that are good for your skin.  This lovely gift set of body wash, lotion and lip balm comes in a nice blue and white reusable round metal tin.  The products all work well to hydrate and smooth skin and are not highly fragranced which is important to me.  I especially love the lotion.  My hands get so dry in winter and this now sits on my bedside table so that I can use it nightly on hands and elbows.  My skin is so much softer and doesn&#x27;t have that dry, tight feeling that I usually get in winter. The body wash lathers well and leaves your skin feeling sort of dewy after showering.  The lip balm glides on smoothly and evenly and I like the sort of chunky tube it&#x27;s in which makes it easier to find in my purse. This would make a great gift for a teacher, coworker or family member.  I plan on buying a couple more myself to give to my mother-in-law and a couple of coworkers.</li>
            <li> This set makes for a thoughtful and actually USEFUL small gift. The packaging is nice and sturdy, and all three products are things almost anyone could use. I think referring to the container as a &amp;#34;limited edition keepsake tin&amp;#34; is maybe pushing it a little, but aside from that you can&#x27;t go wrong with this nicely priced gift set.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice gift.  It includes a big bottle of body wash, a tube of body lotion and lip balm.  All three smell nice.  The products come in a nicely-sized, pretty, blue gift tin.  I could see this as being great for a Christmas or birthday gift for someone who can use an excuse to pamper herself.</li>
            <li> I really like this skincare set.  The scents are very mild in all three products, I really like that.  I have sensitive skin so I was concerned about too much perfume but I didn&#x27;t have a problem while using either of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash comes in a large container.  It smells like Nivea cream but with a very light flowery scent - not overpowering.  It goes on very smooth and it is easy to rinse.  My skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a film of thick soap, just smooth skin.  The body lotion has some parabens in it and I am slightly allergic to them so I can only use it on my hands.  It feels smooth and again, mild scent.  The sunscreen lip moisturizer absorbs quickly, works best under a regular lipstick (extra protection if needed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a nice set, quite affordable at the time of this review (&amp;#60;10 dlls)</li>
            <li> A very soft almond scent is discovered in both of the lotions, the moisturizing body wash and  body lotion. The Nivea touch of smoothness body wash has a rose smell as well that is included (not something I usually lean towards) but it is light,feminine, and does not seem to last too long. My favorite is the smooth sensations body lotion with Shea butter and hydra IQ. From the first application, I noticed smoother hands. I originally put too much on so I had a slippery feeling for about an hour but that too went down along with the almond scent associated with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will make a great gift. It&#x27;s already done for you. The container is very cute and has tissue paper inside wrapping the lotions and lip butter gifts inside.  Pair it with a loofah sponge in a basket or leave as is and I do not think you could go wrong with a co-worker or close friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of lotions, lip balms, and shower gels, and swear I could run a store out of my house, considering the mass quantities of each that I keep in stock in my home, but the contents of this set, I&#x27;m just not so sure about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point-by-point, item-by-item, the lotion, while pleasant smelling, is a bit strange-feeling. It&#x27;s not so much greasy as it is overly gel-y: kinda slimy, and feels like it just won&#x27;t fully absorb in. For super-dry areas like the heels of my feet and my elbows, it&#x27;s good, but for my hands and other less desert-like areas, it&#x27;s just too much moisture, and takes too long to rub in completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel is supposed to have a white tea rose sort of scent, but instead it smells hyper-sterile and chemically to me, with that unpleasant &amp;#34;hospital sterile&amp;#34; sort of scent that I remember Febreze having when it first came on the market. While it&#x27;s pleasantly moisturizing while still cleansing, I&#x27;m finding myself pairing it more and more with shower gels that have a more pleasant scent, but a tendency to strip my skin, in order to get a perfect combination of cleaning and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm, while hyper-moisturizing feeling with the initial touch to one&#x27;s lips, just doesn&#x27;t seem to seal moisture in like my coveted Burt&#x27;s Bees (original) lip balm does. This goes on super slick and almost wet feeling, it&#x27;s got such a seemingly high level of moisture, but 20 minutes later, I find myself reapplying it because my lips just stay somewhat dried out feeling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others might find that these Nivea products are just what they were hoping for, which is why I didn&#x27;t ding this set for more stars... perhaps I just got a bad batch, or these just aren&#x27;t for me. Either way, I won&#x27;t be buying these again for myself, although I have considered some of the items from this set for my older father, who&#x27;s always complaining of stripped-feeling skin after showers with regular gels. Maybe this set would be better suited to him, or someone else... It&#x27;s just not for me, though.suited to him, or someone else... It&#x27;s just not for me, though.</li>
            <li> The three skincare products come in a lovely, decorative tin.  You could use the tin to store other items, leaving it out on display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash leaves skin feeling soft, with a scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  The body lotion has a bit of a stronger scent, but still not too strong.  It worked well on the rough patches of my elbows and soles of my feet.  I can see using this daily.  The lip balm goes on smooth, with no real tint, so you can wear this under lipstick without it changing the color of it.  Overall, a good gift for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful gift set for the price.  It even has a pretty blue metal container, which you can use to store other things after taking out the three products.  All three skin items work well, too.  I used the body wash with a  [[ASIN:B000052YJC Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge - 1 ea]], and it soaped up wonderfully.  It also is great for shaving your legs.  But the scent is off, and with some consumers that means not getting it again.  I&#x27;m one of those consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the body wash was going to smell something like  [[ASIN:B00005354D Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash Mild Refill, Cherry Almond - 16 Oz]]; but instead I thought the scent was more like deodorant soap or laundry detergent! The fragrance lingers in the bath, too, for a while, but there&#x27;s no scent on you after it is washed off.  The body lotion does leave a slight lingering scent on your skin, however, and that also is an off fragrance.  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it.  It&#x27;s not the type that gives you a sinus headache or anything, but it&#x27;s simply unappealing.  The lotion does work well, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip care item is fortunately unscented and also has no flavor that I can detect.  The tube is more like a lipstick one, and the product itself is not as waxy as  [[ASIN:B0063GKX1G Blistex Medicated Lip Balm with SPF 15 for Dryness, Chapping and Soothes Irritated Lips, 0.15oz - Pack of 6]].  The SPF is 15 and it is made in Germany. It&#x27;s great for someone who wants sun protection, as well as a light coating that leaves your lips soft.</li>
            <li> I think the Nivea Skincare Gift Set is a great option for gifting. This reasonably-priced set includes body wash, body lotion and lip care packaged inside an elegantly-designed tin. With products that most everyone can use including a useful keepsake tin for storage, I have no doubt the young lady in your life will appreciate the Nivea Gift Set either as a holiday present or other special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Nivea Skincare Gift Set to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set. I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products, and these 3 items are no exception. The body wash and skin lotion have a pleasant subtle scent, and do the job well. Especially, the skin lotion absorbs very quickly. I don&#x27;t need lip balm too often, but as the weather gets colder that&#x27;s when I use it, and this does the trick. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. These all come in a very nice tin, perfect for those Christmas cookies I hope to be baking this year. And this set is at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Nivea has a reputation for marketing quality skin care products and this three item gift set is no exception.  Both the body wash and the body lotion have a mild and pleasant fragrance and perform their intended functions well.  The lip balm stick is odorless and also works well.  The blue tin is attractive and is reusable – great for keeping cookies and similar items fresh.  At less than $10, this gift set is a great value and excellent as a Holiday gift.</li>
            <li> Nivea in new to me as a product, with the exception of the lip balm. I Love the body wash. It smells wondering and refreshing. It leathers up quite well I might add. It does leave your skin soft too. The lotion is cool too. I would recommend all three of these products to others.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely packaged gift set that comes with body wash, lotion, and lip balm. The tin that the products come in is nice and could definitely be reused to store products. The body wash and lotion have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger forever. The lotion goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy or oily. It is really light weight. The downside of this is that I feel like I need to put it on constantly. This is also the case with the lip balm. It goes on really smoothly and hydrates my lips well but within 15 minutes I feel like I didn&#x27;t even put any on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set if you are looking for moisturizing products that are really light. It personally didn&#x27;t work the best for me based on the fact that I needed lotion and lip balm that lasted longer. I will continue to use it but probably wouldn&#x27;t get it in the future.</li>
            <li> The Nivea Body Smooth Skincare Gift Set is a great value!  The bottle of body wash is a generous full-size.  The lotion, although not in as strikingly huge a bottle as the body wash presents in, in true Nivea fashion, works so well that you don&#x27;t need to glop on a ton of it for your skin to stay hydrated all day, so I&#x27;m finding that the bottle provided is going a long way.  The lip balm has a pleasant feel with no color and no overwhelming or distracting scent and is also a large helping.  As for the gift tin, it&#x27;s sized right to fit all three items in.  It&#x27;s a pretty blue and white design with no branding or ingredient information anywhere on it, so you could actually use it as its own gift wrapping- just add a pretty white or silver bow, and you&#x27;d be set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one a lot!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the items in this skincare gift set. Usually gift sets seem to have sample sizes!  And this comes packaged in a very nice tin - perfect for keeping and reusing. Those two items make it a five star gift set. But, since I enjoy giving gifts that will be enjoyed, I tested the ingredients as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash was everything I was hoping it would be, soothing and a very pleasant scent. As a fan of Almond (remember the old Jergens lotion?) it wasn&#x27;t a full almond scent, but it was enjoyable. I am a body wash lover, so this one made me especially happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbed well in my hands, and on my legs where I used it. I happen to love shea butter, so it hit a good spot with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the lip care didn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling greasy. One of the reasons I dislike lip cares is that I can feel it on them afterwards. Not so with this, it does the job without making me feel like I have something slopped on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is beautifully boxed. My only comment involves the fact that it had a sticker on it stating the price and value - not something you want when you send it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at the size of this tin. It is very big and will be very handy holding something besides what came in it. It came with a big container of body wash which leaves your skin tingling and makes you feel so good. The lotion makes your skin really soft and I love the lip balm which will come in handy at this time of year. I&#x27;ve always loved Nivea products and this is a great set to give someone at Christmas or as an everyday gift. The tin would probably hold at least 2 dozen cookies, maybe more. Very nice set and as always great products!</li>
            <li> The tin this comes in is very nice, a pretty blue color with no writing on it so it will be nice for reuse. Inside is a large bottle of body wash with a very strong floral perfume, a small lotion bottle that smells kind of indistinctly perfumey--reminded me of Avon stuff--and a tube of lip balm with an SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not at all fond of the scent of these items, and the scent is very, very strong and overpowering. I washed off the bit of lotion I tried almost immediately, but after multiple washes the smell is still with me, alas. It makes me sneeze. However some folks may really enjoy this scent. I would recommend purchasing this gift set only if you are really sure about the tastes of the recipient.</li>
            <li> Great gift set, even though i got it for myself. I have dry skin more so during winter and this is perfect. The reason for four stars is the lip balm. Do not care for it at all. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last almost seems like rubbing water on my lips. But the lotion and cream are great. I use the cream about once a week to help keep the moisture in and use the lotion daily. Would definitely buy again for myself and as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Nivea products, and the price of this set makes it a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Both the body wash and the lotion have a sweet and very pleasant scent. The body wash definitely moisturizers and leaves your skin feeling smooth. The lip balm is also smooth and not at all waxy or thick.</li>
