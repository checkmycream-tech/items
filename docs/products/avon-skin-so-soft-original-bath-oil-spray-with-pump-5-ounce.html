            <li>moisturizes and repels mosquitoes , great product.</li>
            <li>The product is great</li>
            <li>GreAt for after showers or before going outdoors to keep bugs away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I could buy it on Amazon without having to go through an Avon agent :-)</li>
            <li>I love SSS!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the spray bottle, all the benefits without the mess!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But I guess it is OK.  </li>
            <li>I called to make sure the shipping estimate date was accurate</li>
            <li>I so enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Original Oil 5oz</li>
            <li>and it was excellent, doesn&#x27;t seem like it worked as well as it use to though, but I use to use it going to lake, now I live deep woods, so the bugs are thicker and more plentiful, they sworm you, but it helps, works great for use not in deep woods, such as lake and etc for bug control, and is great at softening skin, doesn&#x27;t go far though</li>
            <li>Hard to know how to review this item, since the product itself is awesome, but the description of the item (Sold by VanDerPloeg ) is INCORRECT.</li>
            <li>THANKS :)</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, and does not rub off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Needed this FAST for a trip to Honduras (it helps with the sand flies and no see-ums better than bug spray...) and Green Beez was so great to work with.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but only giving it 3 stars because the pump already doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Avon.</li>

            <li> It is a little oily (obviously)</li>
            <li> I also bought this for 2 reasons, one to soften skin, and the other to deter bugs, as I use to use this years ago</li>
            <li> Top leaks, horrible for travel</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Trying this out as an insect repellent. Just reviewing for now to say that YES I did receive a pump with the SSS. UPDATE: Pump stopped working after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> moisturizes and repels mosquitoes , great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent .  Use on my cat for flea protection.  Thanks Avon.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come with a pump as it says. Totally misleading.</li>
            <li> I also bought this for 2 reasons, one to soften skin, and the other to deter bugs, as I use to use this years ago and it was excellent, doesn&#x27;t seem like it worked as well as it use to though, but I use to use it going to lake, now I live deep woods, so the bugs are thicker and more plentiful, they sworm you, but it helps, works great for use not in deep woods, such as lake and etc for bug control, and is great at softening skin, doesn&#x27;t go far though, I go thru it like water when I have it. but anything to soften skin and deter bugs</li>
            <li> I wanted the spray. The bottle says spray. The description says &amp;#34;with pump&amp;#34; and all it is, is a bottle of oil. The product is great but I could not spray it like I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and can&#x27;t live without it. I love the convenience of the spray bottle, all the benefits without the mess!&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my skin soft and smooth, keeping it hydrated all day, and is not heavy or sticky. It smells fresh and clean, and does not rub off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as insect repellent!</li>
            <li> I love SSS! I&#x27;m happy I could buy it on Amazon without having to go through an Avon agent :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dog that I could tell...</li>
            <li> GreAt for after showers or before going outdoors to keep bugs away.  It is a little oily (obviously) so just allow enough time to absorb before adding clothes.</li>
            <li> Hard to know how to review this item, since the product itself is awesome, but the description of the item (Sold by VanDerPloeg ) is INCORRECT. While the item is titled &amp;#34;Avon Sss Original Oil 5oz With Pump&amp;#34; -- and the item I received is indeed labelled identically on the plastic bag that encloses it -- THERE WAS NO PUMP RECEIVED WITH THE PRODUCT, just a cap on the bottle. (See previous two-star review with the same comment.) I would rate it as five stars if the pump had come with it per description.</li>
            <li> I so enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Needed this FAST for a trip to Honduras (it helps with the sand flies and no see-ums better than bug spray...) and Green Beez was so great to work with.  I called to make sure the shipping estimate date was accurate but Cathy was already all over my order and had it to me the next day.  THANKS :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but only giving it 3 stars because the pump already doesn&#x27;t work.  I think I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it and I feel it is too greasy.  But it&#x27;s Avon and I have used Avon products for years.  I just tried SSS again and remembered why I didn&#x27;t care for it.  But I guess it is OK.  It rubs off on the clothes and furniture.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for using after a shower.</li>
            <li> Top leaks, horrible for travel</li>
            <li> My go to bath oil for soft skin.</li>
