    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It feels real good on the rest of the face and on the neck though</li>
            <li>My skin no longer gets oily in the T-zone and my cheeks are perfectly hydrated.</li>
            <li>This product is just wonderful!</li>
            <li>This really is a great skin care line!!!</li>
            <li>I do not recommend buying this or the rest of the products from this line - the spokeswomen are indeed beautiful</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, tightens up the face and has a great SPF.</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>Looks great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had nothing but great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to learn that I could buy this product without joining a beauty products club.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks great when I leave the office at 5 p.m.  </li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>It works best when used with Meaningful Beauty Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I wanted some good skin care.</li>
            <li>I am a 34-year-old woman with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I am 43 and my skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>Meaningful Beauty is a great line, but this product is not one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>Glad that I tried!</li>
            <li>Nice product, thank you.</li>
            <li>Draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this day creme will help the skin and feels so good on the rest of the face, but not too close to the eyes.</li>
            <li>If anyone is unsure about trying it, I would recommend buying the starter kit to see if it&#x27;s suitable for your skin type.  </li>
            <li>If there are some things you like, but others you don&#x27;t, you can either customize your own kit on the Meaningful Beauty website or cancel your account and buy what you like from Amazon or eBay.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Get so many compliments on my skin these days.</li>
            <li>I figured out that it was the Antioxidant Day Creme that was making my skin even more oily</li>
            <li>my skin looks much better ..</li>
            <li>Later that night my face became swollen and incredibly itchy!</li>
            <li>this moisturizer is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Meaningful Beauty line of products for a while now</li>
            <li>but then needed more amounts to feel an adequadate amount of moisture from it.</li>
            <li>Love the SPF20.</li>
            <li>A friend gave me some to try and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and the others don&#x27;t irritate my eyes like this does.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have used Meaningful beauty for almost a year</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, works great, not greasy at all, i use daily for years and my face is always radiant</li>
            <li>I am very fair with freckles and a bit of red.</li>
            <li>I bought the Meaningful Beauty starter kit and was excited to start using the products.  </li>
            <li>Glides on smooth absorbs into skin yet leaves a glow.</li>
            <li>For me though, it&#x27;s just too rich.  </li>
            <li>The day serum and night cream are much better products and better for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>This product has seriously made a huge difference in my skin and Im extremely happy with it!</li>
            <li>I love this product;  my skin is so much softer and radiant.  </li>
            <li>We all need full spectrum daytime protection, even if you are just driving to work.</li>
            <li>they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The true elixer in the MB line is the night creme, but the day creme absorbs quickly and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>You can find many better products (such as Oil of Olay), for a fraction of the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  </li>
            <li>but the way it is sold through Guthrie Renker is a HUGE scam and a real pain when you want to cancel...</li>
            <li>My face is smooth, soft, and pimple free.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it and</li>
            <li>I too, experienced much tearing and discomfort (as other reviewers here stated)</li>
            <li>I apply powder right over the lotion with no foundation.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and came in undamaged.</li>
            <li>This day creme is very emolliant, very silky-soft and feels good until it gets anywhere close to my eyes, then it irritates the heck out of them, so does the eye cream and any of these meaningful beauty products, and I only put on this day cream today and put just a tiny bit around my eyes</li>
            <li>I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li>so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is large so you definately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but that actually work at making your skin look better.</li>
            <li>$150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and</li>
            <li>So your putting a lot of chemicals on first ..</li>
            <li>My family even commented recently that my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li>i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Meaningful Beauty for the past five years straight and nothing has worked better for me.</li>
            <li>They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li>I have my good skin back finally.</li>
            <li>I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, I can imagine that it will work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I do not have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Ive read many of the other reviews and do agree that it burned my eyes at first</li>
            <li>I bought this item on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want the whole set, just wanted to try out the day cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put it very close to my eyes, I just want to warn people.</li>
            <li>It works very well under makeup.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very silky.</li>
            <li>when a bit of the cream hit my eye, not intentional, just normal tearing eye production as the day went on, some must&#x27;ve gotten on my lashes and into my eye and boy, did it hurt!</li>
            <li>Much better than all other products on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a glamour girl and over the years have used Lancome, Clinique, Avon, Basis, Loreal, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Garnier</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it has returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I do powder my nose a couple of times throughout the day to reduce shine, but that&#x27;s normal when you live in Miami.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light but extremely hydrating without any oiliness.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole kit before, but I only really use the day cream and night cream.</li>
            <li>It may seem greasy when you first apply to your skin, and it does produces a slight shine, but it is quickly absorbed and your foundation just GLIDES on.</li>
            <li>Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any problem using this product.</li>
            <li>As I approach 35 yrs old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Before using this product, my skin was very oily and I would often break out, especially in the jaw line/chin areas.</li>
            <li>just-turned 40 year old woman, most people say I look like I&#x27;m in my late twenties to early 30&#x27;s and have even worked as a beauty specialist in a major department store for years.</li>
            <li>No rashes worked out pretty well with my dry skin !</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that they are using many other expensive products and/or procedures in their daily beauty repartee.</li>
            <li>I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and it felt like my skin drank it up</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this and used a very small amount around my crows feet, forehead and frown lines.</li>
            <li>The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
            <li>I may save what I have left and try it again during the winter months when my skin does become a little dryer and see if it makes a difference, I really do want to like it.  </li>

            <li> the products actually last long.</li>
            <li> ..remember it&#x27;s the first few ingredients in a skin car product that are active..  </li>
            <li> If you have some wrinkles or dry skin, this lotion is a must to use daily with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with a pure soap (anything without dyes, harsh perfumes, etc.), mix the day cream with a little SPF on the back of my hand and apply it.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift because I have wanted it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only cream that I would remotely recommend is the Serum</li>
            <li> If your skin is on the dry side, or you have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin....</li>
            <li> Give it time to dry</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and really dry cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I would use those oil absorbing sheets throughout the day to control the shine, but it only seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> so high with the SPF content that I literally felt like I was slabbing on a thick, waterproof summertime sunblock on my face.</li>
            <li> I realize results may be different for different people, but I wanted to at least share my experience.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction like this with other creams</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and have come back to it.  </li>
            <li> so I could put eye concealer on, and boy I knew it was a mistake as usual, and somehow it got into one of my eyes again, just by rubbing next to it, and you feel like you have to keep flushing with water and put cooling eye drops in.</li>
            <li> After using it my eyes started burning a few hours later, it took me a few days to figure out it was the cream causing it.</li>
            <li> Wow, to look like Cindy Crawford or Valerie Bertanelli (who some people say I actually resemble), how can I go wrong</li>
            <li> but I hate the auto delivery option, and I&#x27;ve just been buying the individual pieces as I need them from the original source.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I was truly disappointed to find that the following wrong with these items: the Cleanser - does not lather and therefore requires a lot more quantity in your hand to feel like you&#x27;re getting enough of a cleansing effect.</li>
            <li> Even once the swelling went down and the itch slowed, my face became blotchy and the spots were I had applied</li>
            <li> No oily mess in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy</li>
            <li> this became leathery and that lasted for another few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> SOOOO NOT worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is on the worst skin care list.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my option that no product should be selling chemical face creams, and making false claims..</li>
            <li> Beware please, it was embarrassing and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have given up the expensive treatments at laser clinics and now do at home chemical peels, HA serum, and Cindy Crawfords lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product should be called meaningless</li>
            <li> The refund was tedious...</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The Cindy Crawford moisturizers are quite unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> This day lotion is just horrible, not sure what they put in it, but it needs work!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this woman sponsoring this skin care line...shame</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product protects my face well enough from the sun but it is greasy and smells like sunscreen. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want the whole set, just wanted to try out the day cream. After using it my eyes started burning a few hours later, it took me a few days to figure out it was the cream causing it. I didn&#x27;t put it very close to my eyes, I just want to warn people. I have never had a reaction like this with other creams and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would work as advertised, but I cannot use it without having my face break out in pimples--something I have not had for over 50 years until using this product.  What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> The Cindy Crawford moisturizers are quite unpleasant to use. They leave my skin feeling tacky and sticky, and the smell is reminiscent of the creams my mother bought back in the 1970&#x27;s. Not good. You can find many better products (such as Oil of Olay), for a fraction of the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and have come back to it.  It is not greasy, tightens up the face and has a great SPF.</li>
            <li> If you have some wrinkles or dry skin, this lotion is a must to use daily with the cleanser. Smells nice, works great, not greasy at all, i use daily for years and my face is always radiant</li>
            <li> I love this product;  my skin is so much softer and radiant.  Get so many compliments on my skin these days.</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth absorbs into skin yet leaves a glow. I have sensitive skin and have not had any problem using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this review by saying that I am 49 and have combination skin with an oily T zone, still, at this age!  I bought the Meaningful Beauty starter kit and was excited to start using the products.  After a couple of weeks, I started to notice some bumps under my skin.  I figured out that it was the Antioxidant Day Creme that was making my skin even more oily so I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  Now, I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work because, obviously, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a statement like that.  For me though, it&#x27;s just too rich.  I may save what I have left and try it again during the winter months when my skin does become a little dryer and see if it makes a difference, I really do want to like it.  If you have dry skin, I can imagine that it will work better for you.  If anyone is unsure about trying it, I would recommend buying the starter kit to see if it&#x27;s suitable for your skin type.  It&#x27;s only around $40 and you&#x27;ll get a trial size of the basic line items along with a couple of extras.  If there are some things you like, but others you don&#x27;t, you can either customize your own kit on the Meaningful Beauty website or cancel your account and buy what you like from Amazon or eBay.  Hope this review is as helpful as I intended it to be.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....but the way it is sold through Guthrie Renker is a HUGE scam and a real pain when you want to cancel...I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive but that actually work at making your skin look better. Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...certainly much more expensive then you are led to believe. $150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and then 39.95 the 2 consecutive months...SOOOO NOT worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Please read these ingredients..if you cannot understand them ...shouldn&#x27;t that tell you something..remember it&#x27;s the first few ingredients in a skin car product that are active..  So your putting a lot of chemicals on first ..it&#x27;s my option that no product should be selling chemical face creams, and making false claims.. I am very disappointed in this woman sponsoring this skin care line...shame</li>
            <li> I stopped using this after it broke my skin out.  The day serum and night cream are much better products and better for sensitive skin.  This day lotion is just horrible, not sure what they put in it, but it needs work!!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Glad that I tried! No rashes worked out pretty well with my dry skin ! my skin looks much better ..</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every day and she likes the way it hides her frown lines and wrinkles. The shipping was super fast and came in undamaged.</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is on the worst skin care list. Draw your own conclusions. I used her products before ever seeing this list and sent them back.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift because I have wanted it for a long time. As I approach 35 yrs old I wanted some good skin care. I was so excited to use this and used a very small amount around my crows feet, forehead and frown lines. Later that night my face became swollen and incredibly itchy! So unbearable I had to take a benadryl. This lasted for 2 days. Even once the swelling went down and the itch slowed, my face became blotchy and the spots were I had applied this became leathery and that lasted for another few days. I was so worried my skin was ruined. Thank goodness it has returned to normal. I will never use this again. I do not have super sensitive skin so that&#x27;s not the issue. Beware please, it was embarrassing and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If your skin is on the dry side, or you have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin....this moisturizer is top notch.  Great value.  Give it time to dry otherwise you will feel that it is too oily.  I apply powder right over the lotion with no foundation.  Looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Meaningful Beauty line of products for a while now and I&#x27;ve had nothing but great results. My face is smooth, soft, and pimple free. It&#x27;s a pricey choice of facial care but it&#x27;s worth it and the products actually last long.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved this as a birthday gift (my request) from a family member. I am a youthful looking just-turned 40 year old woman, most people say I look like I&#x27;m in my late twenties to early 30&#x27;s and have even worked as a beauty specialist in a major department store for years. Wow, to look like Cindy Crawford or Valerie Bertanelli (who some people say I actually resemble), how can I go wrong, right? \\&quot;Sign me up!\\&quot; I was truly disappointed to find that the following wrong with these items: the Cleanser - does not lather and therefore requires a lot more quantity in your hand to feel like you&#x27;re getting enough of a cleansing effect. The Day Cream - holy moley! so high with the SPF content that I literally felt like I was slabbing on a thick, waterproof summertime sunblock on my face. I too, experienced much tearing and discomfort (as other reviewers here stated) when a bit of the cream hit my eye, not intentional, just normal tearing eye production as the day went on, some must&#x27;ve gotten on my lashes and into my eye and boy, did it hurt! Had to go wash my eyes out! The only cream that I would remotely recommend is the Serum but even that does not feel moisturizing enough. I have normal to dry skin and it felt like my skin drank it up but then needed more amounts to feel an adequadate amount of moisture from it. I do not recommend buying this or the rest of the products from this line - the spokeswomen are indeed beautiful but I&#x27;m sure that they are using many other expensive products and/or procedures in their daily beauty repartee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. We all need full spectrum daytime protection, even if you are just driving to work. This provides that and antioxidants.  This is my fifth bottle.</li>
            <li> Meaningful Beauty is a great line, but this product is not one of my favorites.  My biggest gripe is that when you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin, it feels like you are pulling your skin to apply it.  Love the SPF20.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to learn that I could buy this product without joining a beauty products club.  A friend gave me some to try and I absolutely love it.  My family even commented recently that my skin has never looked better.  I have given up the expensive treatments at laser clinics and now do at home chemical peels, HA serum, and Cindy Crawfords lotion.  I have my good skin back finally.</li>
            <li> It works very well under makeup.  The true elixer in the MB line is the night creme, but the day creme absorbs quickly and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have it on now. It feels a little heavy but it&#x27;s ok. I have sensitive skin so I never know what a cream will do</li>
            <li> The order arrived promtly with no issues. I really love this product. it&#x27;s light but extremely hydrating without any oiliness.</li>
            <li> I am a 34-year-old woman with fair skin. I&#x27;ve been using Meaningful Beauty for the past five years straight and nothing has worked better for me. I bought the whole kit before, but I only really use the day cream and night cream. Occasionally I&#x27;ll dab on the serum or use the clay mask. Before using this product, my skin was very oily and I would often break out, especially in the jaw line/chin areas. I would use those oil absorbing sheets throughout the day to control the shine, but it only seemed to make it worse. Now I have all day control. I wash my face with a pure soap (anything without dyes, harsh perfumes, etc.), mix the day cream with a little SPF on the back of my hand and apply it. That&#x27;s it. No oily mess in the afternoon. No need to wash my face or blot with sheets. I do powder my nose a couple of times throughout the day to reduce shine, but that&#x27;s normal when you live in Miami. I realize results may be different for different people, but I wanted to at least share my experience.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.....absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> This day creme is very emolliant, very silky-soft and feels good until it gets anywhere close to my eyes, then it irritates the heck out of them, so does the eye cream and any of these meaningful beauty products, and I only put on this day cream today and put just a tiny bit around my eyes so I could put eye concealer on, and boy I knew it was a mistake as usual, and somehow it got into one of my eyes again, just by rubbing next to it, and you feel like you have to keep flushing with water and put cooling eye drops in. I&#x27;m sure this day creme will help the skin and feels so good on the rest of the face, but not too close to the eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and the others don&#x27;t irritate my eyes like this does. That&#x27;s too bad. It feels real good on the rest of the face and on the neck though, it&#x27;s very silky.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It leaves your skin moist and stands up to weather and wind without depleating rapidly. The size is large so you definately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and began using the day creme 8 months ago. I just purchased my third bottle.  I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and really dry cheeks.  It may seem greasy when you first apply to your skin, and it does produces a slight shine, but it is quickly absorbed and your foundation just GLIDES on. My makeup looks great when I leave the office at 5 p.m.  My skin no longer gets oily in the T-zone and my cheeks are perfectly hydrated. Gone are the days of whipping out blotting sheets twice a day to get rid of shine on my nose, chin, or forehead.  I&#x27;m definitely a glamour girl and over the years have used Lancome, Clinique, Avon, Basis, Loreal, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Garnier, you name it!</li>
            <li> This cream kept my skin moist within oily shine and I would order again.  It works best when used with Meaningful Beauty Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  There is nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Meaningful beauty for almost a year and I love it.  I use the skin softening cleanser, the antioxidant day cream and the night cream. I bought it through the commercial but I hate the auto delivery option, and I&#x27;ve just been buying the individual pieces as I need them from the original source.  I am 43 and my skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
            <li> This product is just wonderful! It has evened out my skin tone when I didnt even know I needed that! I am very fair with freckles and a bit of red. This product has seriously made a huge difference in my skin and Im extremely happy with it! Ive read many of the other reviews and do agree that it burned my eyes at first but after a short while it no longer bothered me. This really is a great skin care line!!!</li>
            <li> I swear by the cleanser and moisturizer. Much better than all other products on the market in my opinion. Happy</li>
