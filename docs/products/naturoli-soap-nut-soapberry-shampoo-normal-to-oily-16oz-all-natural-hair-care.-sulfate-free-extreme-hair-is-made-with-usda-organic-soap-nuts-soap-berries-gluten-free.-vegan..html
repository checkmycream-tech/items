            <li>With a sulfate free conditioner, Naturoli shampoo works wonderfully for my needs.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell really good, and they claimed I would not need conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Something that would not just remove the oil and dirt from my hair, but be good for the hair and scalp.</li>

            <li>This shampoo made my hair feel very healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>The clothes have a wonderful fresh feeling when I take them out of the dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Really happy to be using a shampoo free from all the toxic stuff!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you would like to rid your hair care routine of the harmful chemicals used in most products and still have great looking hair give this a try</li>
            <li>I love the amount of great things that soap berries can do.</li>
            <li>I decided to stick with it and give it more time, and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li>My hair now is very healthy, I don&#x27;t use anything else but this shampoo.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I have been using this amazing product for about a year now...</li>

            <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is so shiny, &amp; full &amp; just beautiful.</li>
            <li>, I went and bought a bunch of soapberries and made my own liquid.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, no chemical smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave build-up on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast service.</li>
            <li>styled my hair and it looked nice and shiny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a scent</li>
            <li>Like this shampoo, makes my hair nice, rinses out well</li>
            <li>so any kind of oil or build-up on my hair shows immediately.  </li>
            <li>voluminizers of all kind, root boosters, etc) ..</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so nice from using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Hair looks wonderful and I save money by being very sparing with it.</li>
            <li>It lathers great even with the SLS and my hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li>While it does have a smell to it, which is very mild and pleasant (and I don&#x27;t smell it on my hair)</li>
            <li>The whites come out white, the colors bright, and even the jeans feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through every natural shampoo out there, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>So far, the best shampoo we have found for oily hair.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice sleek container, and has a separate cap that seals better for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best natural solution for oily hair, I have been using Progaine shampoo</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair and softens it without chemical buildup, the best all natural shampoo, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks great!</li>
            <li>My hair felt just amazing, to the point, that I couldnâ€™t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li>hair type is very fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>There is a great great diference between your regular shampoo no matter its brand...</li>
            <li>It was great at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cheap</li>
            <li>It has a very light smell to it.</li>
            <li>its pretty mindblowingly awesome worth every penny</li>
            <li>Then, my hair was easy to brush and comb, and stays nice for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first shampoo of  so ideally clears gives a fresh kind to the hair</li>
            <li>The label isn&#x27;t beautiful, and the original cap that they include isn&#x27;t the useful flip top.</li>
            <li>I have used soap nuts by themselves to wash my hair when I was young and they are very good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my now favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Seems to bring out the color of my hair leaving it shiner, tangle-free and better managed.</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have bot more afterwards</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different brands of organic shampoo and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>After my hair detoxed I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of \\&quot;Green\\&quot; products on the market - but many of them just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>Also, there is not any static cling, even with some of the nylons and rayons.</li>
            <li>To summon it all up - I love this product and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love both of these shampoos.</li>
            <li>Reviewers have even cautioned to resort to having to use it more than 2x a week to see results.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, glossier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Nice, light scent</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I never needed conditioner, after about a week I could feel and see the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and no, you don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li>With the exception that I&#x27;m able to brush my hair without the use of conditioner</li>
            <li>It was better than Avalon though, in that regard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for a daily shampoo!!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do the job.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels squeaky when I get out of the shower, and I&#x27;m always worried it won&#x27;t brush out, but it always brushes out easily, better than when I used conditioner.</li>
            <li>Buying this magnificent shampoo I finally both got or that needs me.it</li>
            <li>but it seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>But I gave it a try and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This feel more than that.</li>
            <li>I can tell my hair stays healthy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>no &#x27;poo method), but not any more.  </li>
            <li>I started using my favorite conditioner again, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since then.</li>
            <li>but it is what was advertised and  the company was fast with great service, well packed ..</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now and there are many things I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy ever.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t go more than 24 hours without washing without looking noticeably greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love.</li>
            <li>I am glad it worked for some people.</li>
            <li>but I love that I&#x27;m not dumping toxins into my scalp when I wash my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have to say, that I really love this.</li>
            <li>I also used to put mousse on my hair to give it more body.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use more shampoo than I&#x27;d like to get it to lather like I want.  </li>
            <li>The flip top is included though, although it just fell out of my package.</li>
            <li>We all love it.</li>
            <li>Sulfate Free!</li>
            <li>Sulfate Free!</li>
            <li>This one gives you healthy hair and healthy</li>
            <li>Love the purity.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 9 months and the longer I use it the better</li>
            <li>My hair gets softer and grooms better</li>
            <li>My hair  has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do need to use s conditioner still with it but even with using it my hair could have never felt better.</li>
            <li>I do alternate with another shampoo, but am impressed at how well this sulfate-free soap nut shampoo does!</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t hesitate like I did - just buy it :)</li>
            <li>Than upon reading more about the product and learning it could take up to a week to see results, I continued use.</li>
            <li>and yet it performs better than any name brand s</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tangles easily and have not had any issues with tangles</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s gets my hair clean and has literally no &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>my hair feels nice and clean after each wash.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t be sudsy, and may not get the kind of clean that I&#x27;m used to PLUS keep the dandruff out.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very clean and seems to volumize my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair, which is fine, also has more volume and body with this shampoo, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo,natural and cleans great with out leaving heavy hair.great smell</li>
            <li>This shampoo does not lather up like a normal shampoo but is very effective in removing oil without over drying out your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have not washed my hair for 6 days and it still looks clean!</li>
            <li>While it cleans my hair very good, I get my hair oily the very next day.</li>
            <li>First, it arrived quickly and in very nice box.</li>
            <li>it is free from Fragrance, which is where many companies hide toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>yeah, this stuff is great so far.</li>
            <li>I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month, and I gotta say that It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is truly sulfate free, alcohol free and safe to use for people who are allergic to so many things that are put into shampoos today.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves hair looking great with a natural shine</li>
            <li>It really cleans her hair good and helps to keep the oils at a minimum.</li>
            <li>Shipping and handling was super fast ... happy customer here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a natural shampoo without sulfates and this product is very nice.  </li>
            <li>(my teenage daughter even requested I buy it again after running out - impressive since kids are often more interested in chasing trends or what ever is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>clean and healthy product thank you</li>
            <li>love the clean.</li>
            <li>The whispy flyaways and easy breakage went away.</li>
            <li>But I had to stop using it very quickly because it was hurting a lot my scalp during all the day.</li>
            <li>You MADE IT ALL EASY AND</li>
            <li>NO other shampoo has ever made my hair feel this great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the bright idea to try this shampoo on the dogs (one of them having longer hair, about 2-3&amp;#34; long strands), and it worked even better on them!</li>
            <li>This is exactly the kind of shampoo I was looking for.</li>
            <li>One note: you have to make sure your hair is thoroughly wet before application to get the best sudsing activity (although not necessary for a good cleansing).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was packed and shipped fine</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been losing any more hair than normal, but I&#x27;m not seeing all the amazing stuff people have been raving</li>
            <li>If I were to switch to a more bubbly shampoo without sacrificing ingredients and was willing to pay more, I would try Living Libations shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is fine when used with a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is plentiful but baby fine with no body at all.  </li>
            <li>My fine hair didn&#x27;t like that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>but I am totally fine with that.</li>
            <li>(I have really fine hair, so any grease shows up).</li>
            <li>I use zero products on my hair aside from shampoo, and my hair had been fine for a week.</li>
            <li>everything is fine, thx</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased the product and thanks to Prime, received VERY quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Most of us in America need to get smart and stop letting the media/corporate cheats that sell cheap chemicals to us for a huge profits and tell us what is acceptable and healthy for us, while in fact are selling us poisonous chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best natural shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li>This was my &amp;#34;I think I made a huge mistake&amp;#34; purchase after trying to go &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and no cancer or thinning hair later on.</li>
            <li>my hair oil/dirt free.</li>
            <li>If only I could go two days without washing my hair, this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be switching up with another sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>If sulfate free stuff starts to not work then once</li>
            <li>Some people have commented that this isn&#x27;t fragrance free.</li>
            <li>free shampoos and figured why stop there?  </li>
            <li>Also, the downside of an oil free scalp is even drier ends.</li>
            <li>So I went ahead and did a light combing and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I now buy it for use at home.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the shampoo but could not justify the price when contemplating reordering.</li>
            <li>it was sulfate free thinking</li>
            <li>My hair, on its own volition, goes from curly to wavy to straight.</li>
            <li>, I added a sulfate free conditioner to my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Gluten free.</li>
            <li>Gluten free.</li>
            <li>This product sounds great, but the only thing &amp;#34;EXTREME&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I&#x27;ve used this same shampoo since I purchased it and haven&#x27;t had to switch!</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;gulp&amp;#62; I used it several more times, but I always have to have some good conditioner to apply</li>
            <li>This is fantastic shampoo and the only one I have every found to make my hair look and feel amazing!</li>
            <li>It went through my hair pretty well with a good scalp massage, and washed out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>in all: Super duper great shampoo, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend for people with oily hair!</li>
            <li>I use the normal to oily formula, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super fine</li>
            <li>I was willing to spend this amount for shampoo every time if it worked because people have been claiming that they have been able to go longer days without washing their hair and suffering the oily roots.</li>
            <li>The price tag is too steep, but the good thing is you really do not need to use much to get a good wash.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, cleaning shampoo for someone with normal to oily hair who has to shampoo every day.  </li>
            <li>Soap nuts are good for laundry, too, and apparently work well for shampoos.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair, doesn&#x27;t really have a (strong) smell and does the job!</li>
            <li>Simply the best natural shampoo</li>
            <li>I tried no poo, coconut milk and dr. bronners but my hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li>Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Gluten Free! -</li>
            <li>At this moment, I&#x27;m using it when I clean my hair before I henna it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say out of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (clarifying, traditional, natural), the one that does the best job is the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Hair is shiny and clean after wash, but if conditioner is not used don&#x27;t bother brushing your hair.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to no suds you will notice shine, softness, stays clean longer between shampoos because you are not putting grease in hair.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m getting all of my hair clean if it isn&#x27;t lathered.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have to use the product twice - wash - rinse - repeat but it leaves my hair squeaky clean</li>
            <li>(she spent so many years straightening it, we both though the curls were gone for good).</li>
            <li>So natural and lovely results!</li>
            <li>I was Pleasantly surprised, and Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair clean and full of body and there is no need for conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve be using this for the last six months and my hair is pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>I have dyed bright red hair.</li>
            <li>and it even smells pretty good, which is not always the case with natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>Look into it, soap berries from Greenwill are amazing and the whole reason I got into the Soap berry in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to reduce the number of chemicals in my body, so it is nice to have an all natural product that works as described.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased and tried many shampoos for my son who has very oily hair and seborreah</li>
            <li>I also have finally settled on a good soap too,</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li>In that time, my hair got stonger and did a full detox, but over time it never stopped being oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there that promises to thicken and volumize but nothing has ever really ever worked leaving me with too many embarrassing &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; to count.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fit, eat right, take in plenty of exercise and water so my hair should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and usually my hair does great with sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>:) I do like how clean it gets my hair, though, so I will probably continue buying it, but only for an every now and then shampoo. :)</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my hair feel soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever found for my hair (thin, fine and oily).</li>
            <li>I really feel like my hair and scalp become very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go through a major &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34; phase and the first bottle was well loved.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, fresh smelling, and manageable without conditioner.</li>
            <li>price is comparable to what I was paying at the salon but this works better on my hair, is better for my hair, and it seems like it&#x27;s going to last longer!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shining, there is no need to wash them every day as after using this shampoo my hair does not get oily as quickly as before.</li>
            <li>Although they did helped to make my hair look decent, every time I had to do my hair, it worried me how many toxic chemicals i was putting in my scalp.</li>
            <li>Shipment is super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li>So I had to have a second opinion because I couldn&#x27;t believe this stuff could really be this great.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as all the shampoos with detergents in them, but if you follow the directions it suds up well enough to be able to feel it throughout your hair (and I have a lot of it)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She tried it and her hair was glorious - shiny and beautiful with all of the curls she had when she was a little girl</li>
            <li>but I was concerned about the healthy issues for using high alcohol based products.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt very clean, and looked white and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  </li>
            <li>I went a couple of weeks without a conditioner when first trying the product and my hair threw a fit.  </li>
            <li>but I was becoming very worried about the loss I was seeing</li>
            <li>I knew there had to be something better out there (products that were environmentally friendly and with natural ingredients).</li>
            <li>Wanting to find a good natural shampoo, I tried the NaturOli Normal to Oily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much when you first put it on, but if you rinse and repeat it works much better.  </li>
            <li>This stuff cleans y hair at a  good price and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved how little my hair changed when I switched to this product; it works as well as any chemically-laced shampoo, and you can feel safe that your hair isn&#x27;t soaking in cancerous gel ;D</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very soft and is more manageable.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this (the most REAL natural shampoo I could find), and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>and VERY hard for me to believe unless I actually experienced it!)</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t needed to use a conditioner, and very little styling products because my hair now lays in place beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist constantly reminds me how amazing my hair looks for my age.</li>
            <li>My scalp is amazing different!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I wish I had discovered it earlier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into my second bottle and it has continued to work amazingly for controlling my oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i compensate that later with my nubian heritage hair mousse, amazing scent.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product when I started looking into more natural products.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the purity of the product.  </li>
            <li>I love knowing that all the ingredients are all natural and there aren&#x27;t preservatives in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This one lathers nicely, has essentially no scent, and leaves my hair looking and feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, I used this shampoo twice and my scalp is already 95 % better.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is worth the money.</li>
            <li>NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li>It will take a month, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I missed the suds, they were nice to have back.  </li>
            <li>If I do use hairspray (rare occasions) I will have to wash and rinse through twice.  </li>
            <li>I would like to thanks Amazon for not only being a purchase tool but for become a great platform that really make a better world giving us the opportunity to discover natural products that saves lifes</li>
            <li>This shampoo is well worth it, and you can tell how well it works immediately after your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s results will vary depending on their body chemistry, but this shampoo&#x27;s worth a try, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive scalp that most shampoos cause to break out and itch, this shampoo seems to minimize problems.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try in my opinion.</li>
            <li>am sensitive to most skin and hair products.</li>
            <li>but this is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m back here at Amazon.com to buy a couple more bottles of this fantastic shampoo as I think mine is in danger of disappearing into the girls&#x27; apartment</li>
            <li>I tried going &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for three months and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results but still wanted a natural product and came by this.</li>
            <li>Hair gets oily pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>They screw right on your shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will notice right away that your hair and scalp are really and simply clean...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself as having oily hair, but because my hair was fine, I chose the normal to oily variation of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have normal to oily fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very pure and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good.</li>
            <li>It seems like it is the only natural and chemical free shampoo that I tried that made my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, not coarse at all</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair clean, dry, and healthy even with all the dirt and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo for a week, my hair becomes incredibly soft and easy to manage, not to mention the volumizing effect.</li>
            <li>It looked so nice partially dry</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products for my oily hair, but nothing worked as much as NaturOli did.&lt;br /&gt;Great feeling to use an all natural product and also have some terrific results.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for normal or normal-to-oily hair; I always use Sulfate-free products and I do feel that it is much less damaging to my hair (less split ends!), and I&#x27;m happy to have added this one to the tried list.</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how silky and shiny my hair was.  </li>
            <li>For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene.</li>
            <li>My top area feels pretty coarse</li>
            <li>I have definitely been doing that and more to no noticeable results at all.</li>
            <li>My scalp is still more oily than I hoped but overall improved.</li>
            <li>I do not wash my hair every day, as I have found that it actually makes my hair even more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a million shampoos and some might work for most of the day and maybe into the next day some</li>
            <li>If I have styling products in, I rinse with this shampoo twice, if not, only one rinse will do. :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of using more to try to get the same slippery, foamy feel out of this shampoo - you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>I had to learn how to make everything myself, and it was pretty overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first bottle will go faster while it detoxes your scalp with multi washes per shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan, it does exactly as it says it does.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I read the instructions, and it does say that if your hair has been subjected to chemically induced shampoos that results may take a week.  </li>
            <li>I first tried &amp;#34;Silicone/Sulfate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I dove head first into the process of going without shampoo.  </li>
            <li>ready tosave the day if I start loosing hair!</li>
            <li>And you really can use it alone, without any conditioner!</li>
            <li>It worked after the first use.</li>
            <li>love that this shampoo actually foams.  </li>
            <li>It made me feel like it was working the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using these products for several months now, and am utterly in love.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Well, long story short, I haven&#x27;t experienced dandruff like that since, so I suppose (?)</li>
            <li>which would be the first time in my life..</li>
            <li>This shampoo is my first experience with soap nut &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was leery of this at first knowing</li>
            <li>First time in my life.</li>
            <li>Its so pretty and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Or I wish they could make bigger bottles :)</li>
            <li>but I cycle through 3 different shampoos and this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love all the extra benefits you get</li>
            <li>And it looks really pretty and shiny too.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding a good organic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but not really that much more amazing than any other natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves hair extremely clean and soft without use of more than a tiny drop of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>my hair looks healthy, doesn&#x27;t break and is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;For someone having scalp problems or for someone that just wants to use a natural product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use with my babies and the light scent is perfect - even for someone who typically looks for products without any essential oils.</li>
            <li>The original natural shampoo from from plants.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seriously can not believe how great this product is on my hair.</li>
            <li>early afternoon I can squeak two days of clean looking out of it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>although my hair still felt course while wet, the tangles became extremely easy to get rid of and my hair started becoming very soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many bottles of this shampoo and will never switch as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li>shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching to Morrocco Method&#x27;s shampoo which is working out better long term.</li>
            <li>think this shampoo helped me transition to better shampoo but long term</li>
            <li>At first, after about 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I wish it worked up into a better lather, but it does leave my hair really clean every time and I also deal with less frizz than I did before, even without any conditioner!</li>
            <li>Also, this leaves my hair frizzy, dry and prone to static.</li>
            <li>so your hair smells just like clean hair... if you are loosing hair, you can be sure that by your third or fourth wash it will stop falling...</li>
            <li>and she has beautiful, waist long dark blond hair -</li>
            <li>It certainly cleaned well, almost too well because it left my long, fine hair in so many tangles while trying to rinse it in the shower...</li>
            <li>I really do love it and think it would work great with anyone with average to thick hair or even curls.</li>
            <li>and my hair is manageble, i do smell some soapnuts and also feel slight dandruff, but overall it helped my hair fall problem, so i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I am now in love with my hair  :) I have very oily hair and for the first two weeks it seem as if the shampoo was making it worse.</li>
            <li>I have color treated (streaked blonde) hair that is cotton candy fine.  </li>
            <li>I used it for over a week with really good results, but then we had a water filter installed (we had REALLY hard water).</li>
            <li>I liked it well enough and will probably get more and mix up a little natural conditioner to use with it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not very sudsy so make sure your hair is drenched in water before you lather it on and do it fast because it&#x27;s like putting a runny gel.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this shampoo, and plan on using up the entire bottle, as I really like it.</li>
            <li>Since I was looking for something completely organic and natural, this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>that I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not going to put any product on it&amp;#34; which is a huge big deal for</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very well  packed and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I have very itchy skin after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t return, because I opened one</li>
            <li>I think this will work very well for you.</li>
            <li>I also have to add that the shipping is really reasonable.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that this shampoo balances secretion of oil glands very well in my scalp leaving it itch-free and</li>
            <li>This is a truly gentle and well cleansing product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really is everything everyone says it is.</li>
            <li>I only buy sulfate free shampoo and found this shampoo when looking for a clarifying shampoo w/out sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I have poker straight, medium brown untreated hair.</li>
            <li>So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>hair gets oily fast.</li>
            <li>I WOULD use some conditioner on the tips of my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t tangle so much.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not breaking as much either, even without conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>very recommend!Now</li>
            <li>and it is definitely very tangled after i wash it.  </li>
            <li>But i have come to realize if you dont wash the bottom ends of your hair very often (</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, who has oily hair, and she seems to really like the way it works.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but not a lot is required.</li>
            <li>I absolutely still have to use a conditioner with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>also it strips too much oil off my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very course straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten a bunch of compliments on how healthy my long dark hair looks and better than anything else,</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that any shampoo could make that much of a difference in a matter of one week</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li>For the price, this product is an absolute ripoff.</li>
            <li>It tangles my hair too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks NaturOli</li>
            <li>/&gt;To say that I am very please with this sulfate and dimethicone-free shampoo is an understatement.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very please with it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>, I hope you like it as much as I</li>
            <li>It also really helps in protecting my hair from dryness.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Nature.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>This shampoo gently cleanses the scalp, by removing EXCESS oil from it, and from the hair.</li>
            <li>And, since my hair does not get greasy, the dust etc. does not stick to it as much.</li>
            <li>I have always has very oily skin and hair.</li>
            <li>it did take about a week for my hair to adapt to the shampoo as noted in the instructions, but I highly recommend this product and will be ordering the laundry and kitchen products as well!</li>
            <li>Actually I really like this</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>We are trying to stay away from chemicals, there&#x27;s too much of that going on.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the smelling oil and keeps it very shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a real cheapskate</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it had more volume even though it was wet.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely be using this product for years to come and suggest it to friends.</li>
            <li>but regardless I&#x27;ve never had so much bounce and volume in my hair</li>
            <li>that keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair from looking oily so fast.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found a natural product that works and</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a pleasant, subtle scent, that does not stick to my hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, a company with an honest ingredient list that actually works and lives up to its advertising!</li>
            <li>Lets just say this: When I got my hair cut last, the hair salon stylist was AMAZED at how healthy and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>It stopped falling out (after the plain soapberry liquid) and is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several sulfate-free shampoos and this one is both gentle on my hair and gets it clean without leaving a build up.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the shampoo, so don&#x27;t try to work up a big lather, as that is not needed to clean the hair.</li>
            <li>If i wash every other day, I have much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other shampoos give you healthy LOOKING hair.</li>
            <li>Taking care of it and keeping it clean is a constant battle for me.</li>
            <li>I went on my cleansing adventure to find a way to score an extra day of clean looking hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I also tolerated the grease for long enough to see whether or not it was going to improve on its own.</li>
            <li>My hair fell quite naturally into the beautiful cut my stylist gave me, and the ends seemed sealed/thick (which I&#x27;ve never experienced).</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t lather quite like most shampoos we&#x27;re used to; however, I found that watering it down in your hands really brings out the sudsiness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say it has made a huge difference to my hair, but considering it is all natural with none of the nasty things some shampoos contain, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very, very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>so finding something that doesn&#x27;t leave hard water residue in my hair has been very challenging.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is totally natural and works better than the Progaine itself, leave my hair dry as I want.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and unruly ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absolute last straw was at my most recent salon visit when I was told my hair is thinning - a LOT.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t consider wanting real and natural products a trend.</li>
            <li>Glad to have one less step in the shower.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has no particular smell, but that&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li>sulfate free is the way to go when you have dry curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li>my expectations of this product are less oil, more health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to everything, from sound, smells, and chemicals, but a recent allergic reaction caused me to start reacting to almost everything in my life, from detergent, to shampoo, to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I still have most of the bottle, it does lather but it takes a bit of rubbing to get it going, and it doesn&#x27;t build up the same way with regular shampoo, not that I was expecting it to.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, if I can find a SUPER conditioner that is non-toxic, I may keep using this shampoo on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>My hair did not need a conditioner, was light and soft, and still felt that way they next day!</li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;I only need to wash my hair once every two to three days, and am guessing my bottle of shampoo will last me about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I know thinning of the hair happens as we get older, but I just don&#x27;t have any hair to spare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with the product because it gently cleans my hair without irritating my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but once it did, Wow!  Commercial shampoos never made my hair look half as good.</li>
            <li>I let it sit a few minutes and quickly rinse with cool water.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those of us with normal/oily hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>IF you are looking for an organic solution to your shampooing routine I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will not go back to the other kind.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally oily long hair.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean, my hair feels soft but by the next day my scalp is itchy and hair oily again.</li>
            <li>, the suds are soft and gentle, and not like one would expect from a shampoo, but it cleaned my hair &amp;#34;squeaky-clean&amp;#34;!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair became extremely soft and whispy, but now some strands stick straight up.</li>

            <li>Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair</li>
            <li>For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair</li>
            <li>first wash, I did one rinse and light shampoo, followed by one heavy lather and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My housemates (all guys who normally don&#x27;t pay attention to this sort of thing) compliment my hair and want to try this out.</li>
            <li>I have oily scalp with normal hair.</li>
            <li>, I decided to use Naturoli for normal to oily</li>
            <li>My hair is \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is recommended for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>more itching scalp after harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is because the first time it doesn&#x27;t latter much for me, however the second time, It lathers nicely.--Also, my hair gets very tangled, and at first I was inclined to buy another organic and natural detangler, but decided not to, I just learned to be patient and gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li>Not the case with NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo normal to oily hair.  </li>
            <li>ran out of this for about two days and had to use &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li>I immediately used a conditioner after that, in hopes to counter the drying effects of the normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair, it actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>have since switched to Carina Organics Pure &amp; Natural Daily Moisturizing Shampoo, Pure &amp; Natural Daily Light Conditioner and Pure &amp; Natural Dandruff Flake Removal Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just to keep down on the frizz that my hair naturally does, I also spray my hair with coconut oil. :)</li>
            <li>My hair would feel ultra soft and clean right after rinsing but by the next day, my scalp would be itchy and hair flat from all the oil.</li>
            <li>I tried using less shampoo, because some websites said that soft water doesn&#x27;t rinse as well, and I tried using MORE shampoo...</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product, because I was starting down the path to rid my life of as many chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li>It took build up off, my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy, my hair was soft and clean and it really surprised me that it actually worked.</li>
            <li>;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gluten free and have problems with other &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>In the oily formula it&#x27;s the only shampoo (and we&#x27;ve tried SO MANY, natural, not natural)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try some of NaturOli&#x27;s other products and highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>But this is my new shampoo</li>
            <li>The only problem it that I have to use so much to make it really lather on my head.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does what it says as far as balancing the natural oil secretion in your scalp.</li>
            <li>I carefully researched products that would be environmentally safe for water that could possibly reach our pond and thus the fish that we might eat.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling smooth after you wash off the shampoo, it actually feels the opposite.</li>
            <li>I liked the Castile soap, but it left my hair feeling somewhat heavy, perhaps from the glycerin.</li>
            <li>My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap.</li>
            <li>So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more.</li>
            <li>so I use it about every other time--but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Because this one is so expensive I&#x27;ve tried many others natural and synthetic fragrance free shampoos hoping I can switch to something cheaper</li>
            <li>Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then.</li>
            <li>I definitely lost more hair using this shampoo than the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo or other shampoos</li>
            <li>This is the first non-damaging shampoo I&#x27;ve found that I actually LIKE!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this shampoo, due to all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>We like it much better than the chemical washes we used in the past.</li>
            <li>but if anyone is struggling with hair that&#x27;s clean one day, extra oily the next, and always itchy</li>
            <li>I did not notice a smell other than clean from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>thought that this product might offer me an alternative to making my own shampoo (which had been disappointing and frustrating) and from all the product reviews I was sure that it would be safe for me.</li>
            <li>Not only a big saving but also a step in the right direction to help our environment!</li>
            <li>when light hits jet black hair, it&#x27;s shiny.</li>
            <li>and this is the only natural shampoo that consistently works for me.  </li>
            <li>I actually &#x27;felt&#x27; how much the &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo was stripping from my hair.</li>
            <li>once I dried my hair, it was so shiny, strong and manageable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick fine (Asian) hair and my roots/bangs area can get oily in a day and will show readily on day 2 if not washed again.</li>
            <li>Other shampoos are full of chemicals and fragrance that just seemed to aggrevate things.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left a bizarre film on my hair and made my head and face feel very strange.  </li>
            <li>I mix in a little 100% Pure brand kids shampoo to make it smell fun.</li>
            <li>I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of</li>
            <li>many other reviewers, once my hair was dry it felt soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using this shampoo, I was literally starting to bald from losing so much hair (for reference, I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>After making the switch to an all natural lifestyle, shampoo was the hardest for me to give up.</li>
            <li>Natural, no harsh chemicals, sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny, with not itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Left hair with a very greasy feeling, like it just took the oil off your scalp and redistributed it all over your hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I kept telling myself I needed time to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; from my old shampoos, but if a product cannot produce results after using it exclusively for months, then it&#x27;s not going to work for</li>
            <li>have tried the no-poo method (i.e. giving up shampoo completely)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the Holy Grail of natural, oily-hair shampoos.</li>
            <li>So, I started looking for a truly natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you want organic and natural..........</li>
            <li>When I switched to a natural shampoo I wanted something with suds.</li>
            <li>(darn you natural stuff)</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft and smells alright too.</li>
            <li>My hair is as soft and manageble as it is with the salon product.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea that its all natural.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural shampoo and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>The later isn&#x27;t very plentiful, but that&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it to make it overly sudsy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 74 years old, and do not want to become bald.  </li>
            <li>this product has cleared out all the chemicals from my hair with has been mistreated with every hair color under the sun since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has lathered up quite well and rinsed out</li>
            <li>My family purchased this product when we bought a cabin near a sensitive eco-system.  </li>
            <li>I let the product sit in my hair for 5 mins before rinsing out (in hope that my hair can absorb all the nutrients from the shampoo&#x27;s natural ingredients).</li>
            <li>I wanted to get away from chemicals in my beauty care products, and so began looking for things which claimed to be natural or organic.</li>
            <li>not too wild about his shampoo.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to go through a detox phase because i always use natural hair products.</li>
            <li>B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nut / Soapberry Shampoo 16oz Organic Natural Hair Care.</li>
            <li>B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nut / Soapberry Shampoo 16oz Organic Natural Hair Care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, has lots of volume (which has always been my #1 priority), and stays hydrated plus (no splint ends so far) and</li>
            <li>I have tried several organic, sulfate free, low chemical shampoos and they all left my hair clumpy and oily.  </li>
            <li>although arguably a chemical, this is the natural way to go.</li>
            <li>We also use coconut none scented soap and are in process of changing our underarm deodorant to be natural.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well with soft water.</li>
            <li>I am a &#x27;natural&#x27; girl when it comes to products.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t stop commenting on it and about five different people felt my hair that day (hahaha).  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural shampoo for my prepubescent daughter.</li>
            <li>I was VERY hesitant to buy it when I read a couple of reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional shampoo (again, my fear of dirty/flat hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed five times so far ....</li>
            <li>At the price I paid, I would have liked to go at least a day without my hair turning oily, especially because it states this shampoo is for normal/oily hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and clean (but hard to detangle) and it didn&#x27;t change my shower routine much.</li>
            <li>shampoo gets rid of the oiliness, but my hair now gets extremely frizzy and breaks more easily (possibly because Naturoli does such a thorough job of getting rid of all oil).</li>
            <li>I used this Great Sulfate free shampoo as a healthier base and added my essential oils to it to heal and naturally renew my Aunt Deve&#x27;s scalp,skin, and quality of life back to normal.</li>
            <li>First week was tangly and dry but it improved after that.</li>
            <li>the only thing that got my hair back to being clean and shiny was to go out and buy a regular Herbal Essences shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like a little bit of a clean smelling shampoo</li>
            <li>I like using soap nuts to clean with and do laundry, so I decided to try this soapberry shampoo since I wanted to get away from all the shampoos and conditioners with harsh chemicals and toxins in them.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves my hair and scalp clean without being dried out.  </li>
            <li>After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner for the first time ever and my hair actually still has bounce the next day.</li>
            <li>While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and order it as soon as the bottle becomes low</li>
            <li>Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time.</li>
            <li>I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and it feels clean, slightly textured, and soft.  </li>
            <li>If you brush your hair thoroughly before showering then you dont need an additional conditioner but otherwise its pretty rough.</li>
            <li>I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time.</li>
            <li>so I wash twice and the second lather is always nice and soapy like the first on a regular creepy chemical shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most other shampoos still contain harsh detergents that damage your hair, even though they claim to be organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes dry ends without making the scalp oily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dye my hair or over style it or even blow dry it much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap.</li>
            <li>oil managing ingredients, my hair does not get oily as the day winds down, nor right after shampooing with some shampoos.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, NO other conditioners needed.</li>
            <li>I will use no other.  </li>
            <li>No other conditioners, or products are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could barely pull my fingers out because it was so tangled!</li>
            <li>I always would resort back to a salon name brand shampoo which has so many toxins in it but would leave my hair feeling soft an not oily- at least till the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it lathered up in the shower just as much as any other shampoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost, as I have either eliminated or cut way back on all of the other styling products.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well, but leaves my hair very dry, and lifeless.</li>
            <li>Then, when I combed through my hair, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and thick it felt</li>
            <li>I think that plus the general goodness of the shampoo is helping my hair growth, as my hair is shinier, a bit stronger, and has no dandruff.</li>
            <li>but this bottle seems to last a long time since you don&#x27;t need to use a  whole lot.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily hair; with all other shampoos (even sulfate and gluten free shampoos), my hair is always oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I bought a trial size and got about 4 uses out of it and in that short amount of time it completely calmed my scalp.</li>
            <li>A natural, American made product that works as well as anything else.</li>
            <li>far the results are the same.</li>
            <li>but this.....this is by far different from the rest.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s been three weeks, and so far I don&#x27;t see anything different about my hair than when I was using Avalon shampoos.  </li>
            <li>: I definitely recommend this shampoo if you are conscious of the products you use on your hair and body, and know that nothing here will damage your hair.</li>
            <li>I try to use only organic, natural based products.</li>
            <li>I can tell that when I brush my wet hair after getting out of the shower, the brush goes straight through it...where before it would be tangled.</li>
            <li>they were just chasing what they would likely consider a trend to be natural.</li>
            <li>AND I had some of my natural curl back that I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft with no conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft and shiny and If I had thicker hair, this would be the only shampoo for me.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that waaay more of my hair than normal came out in the wash, which I noticed several other people complained about.</li>
            <li>Just trust that using a normal amount - I use about 2 quarter-size globs for my very long hair - will get the job done.</li>
            <li>So I will probably try their normal to dry formula</li>
            <li>I ordered the sample sizes of this one and the one for normal to dry hair from naturOli web-site.</li>
            <li>Normal to Dry.</li>
            <li>Normal to Dry.</li>
            <li>It got my hair clean with a small quarter size dollop--my hair is in a pixie cut--and lathered up like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>was after using Extreme Hair because it didn&#x27;t do much to soften it, however it worked wonders for my irritated scalp.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps the medical condition, but really takes care of the oily hair.  </li>
            <li>not of high quality, it is very thick and gelatinous, like jello, it takes about double to three times as much product as other shampoos I have used, just to get my hair soapy and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>To be clear though, this Soapnut/Soapberry shampoo has not entirely rid my hair of all oil or tiny flakes, so I took one star off.</li>
            <li>Not made for natural African American hair!</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your hair and it does not leave it oily either.  </li>
            <li>The first week of use, I was a little iffy.  </li>
            <li>I live in a place with a very dry climate (Arizona)</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again, but I&#x27;m glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, as it was a bit difficult to run a comb through my long hair when it was wet.</li>
            <li>At first I tried fundamental earth fundamental shampoo (lavender) but it made my hair too dry and extremely knotty.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft and shiny when dry.</li>
            <li>After using this in conjunction with my normal conditioner after a week, my hair is oily by the third day, but I guess that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty expensive, but definitely worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She normally washes her hair every other day.</li>
            <li>I started having to shower every day (normally I shower every other day), but it wasn&#x27;t helping...</li>
            <li>guess cause I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos for half a year now, there was no &amp;#34;buildup&amp;#34; for this one to clear away.  </li>
            <li>Also, definitely no conditioner needed - just as w/ any truly natural shampoo, let your hair dry before brushing.</li>
            <li>This really helps with static, tangles, and hard water residue (if you have hard water like we do!).</li>
            <li>But my hair is so fine and thin that this does not help at all.  </li>
            <li>but if you have fine thin hair like I do it will leave you with even thinner looking hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad though, and I actually learned that this is commonly mistaken as dandruff, but in reality, dandruff doesnt flake and is instead larger chunks (usually yellow not white) attached to the scalp.</li>
            <li>The normal to dry variation has guar gum, which I assume is used to protect dry hair.</li>
            <li>The shampooing experience isn&#x27;t quite as fun bc although it lathers it&#x27;s hard to get it all through your hair.</li>

            <li> With a sulfate free conditioner, Naturoli shampoo works wonderfully for my needs.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell really good, and they claimed I would not need conditioner.  </li>

            <li> I love the amount of great things that soap berries can do.</li>

            <li> But this shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is vegan and gluten free, so it&#x27;s great for those that are worried about allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing product for about a year now...</li>

            <li> Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is so shiny, &amp; full &amp; just beautiful.</li>
            <li> , I went and bought a bunch of soapberries and made my own liquid.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, no chemical smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave build-up on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast service.</li>
            <li> styled my hair and it looked nice and shiny!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a scent</li>
            <li> Like this shampoo, makes my hair nice, rinses out well</li>
            <li> so any kind of oil or build-up on my hair shows immediately.  </li>
            <li> voluminizers of all kind, root boosters, etc) ..</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so nice from using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hair looks wonderful and I save money by being very sparing with it.</li>
            <li> It lathers great even with the SLS and my hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li> While it does have a smell to it, which is very mild and pleasant (and I don&#x27;t smell it on my hair)</li>
            <li> The whites come out white, the colors bright, and even the jeans feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through every natural shampoo out there, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> So far, the best shampoo we have found for oily hair.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice sleek container, and has a separate cap that seals better for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best natural solution for oily hair, I have been using Progaine shampoo</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair and softens it without chemical buildup, the best all natural shampoo, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and looks great!</li>
            <li> My hair felt just amazing, to the point, that I couldnâ€™t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li> hair type is very fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> There is a great great diference between your regular shampoo no matter its brand...</li>
            <li> It was great at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cheap</li>
            <li> It has a very light smell to it.</li>
            <li> its pretty mindblowingly awesome worth every penny</li>
            <li> Then, my hair was easy to brush and comb, and stays nice for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first shampoo of  so ideally clears gives a fresh kind to the hair</li>
            <li> The label isn&#x27;t beautiful, and the original cap that they include isn&#x27;t the useful flip top.</li>
            <li> I have used soap nuts by themselves to wash my hair when I was young and they are very good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my now favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Seems to bring out the color of my hair leaving it shiner, tangle-free and better managed.</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have bot more afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different brands of organic shampoo and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> After my hair detoxed I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of \\&quot;Green\\&quot; products on the market - but many of them just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Also, there is not any static cling, even with some of the nylons and rayons.</li>
            <li> To summon it all up - I love this product and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love both of these shampoos.</li>
            <li> Reviewers have even cautioned to resort to having to use it more than 2x a week to see results.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, glossier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I never needed conditioner, after about a week I could feel and see the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and no, you don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li> With the exception that I&#x27;m able to brush my hair without the use of conditioner</li>
            <li> It was better than Avalon though, in that regard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for a daily shampoo!!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do the job.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels squeaky when I get out of the shower, and I&#x27;m always worried it won&#x27;t brush out, but it always brushes out easily, better than when I used conditioner.</li>
            <li> Buying this magnificent shampoo I finally both got or that needs me.it</li>
            <li> but it seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> But I gave it a try and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This feel more than that.</li>
            <li> I can tell my hair stays healthy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> no &#x27;poo method), but not any more.  </li>
            <li> I started using my favorite conditioner again, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since then.</li>
            <li> but it is what was advertised and  the company was fast with great service, well packed ..</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now and there are many things I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy ever.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t go more than 24 hours without washing without looking noticeably greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love.</li>
            <li> I am glad it worked for some people.</li>
            <li> but I love that I&#x27;m not dumping toxins into my scalp when I wash my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have to say, that I really love this.</li>
            <li> I also used to put mousse on my hair to give it more body.  </li>
            <li> I do have to use more shampoo than I&#x27;d like to get it to lather like I want.  </li>
            <li> The flip top is included though, although it just fell out of my package.</li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>

            <li> My hair  has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do need to use s conditioner still with it but even with using it my hair could have never felt better.</li>
            <li> I do alternate with another shampoo, but am impressed at how well this sulfate-free soap nut shampoo does!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t hesitate like I did - just buy it :)</li>
            <li> Than upon reading more about the product and learning it could take up to a week to see results, I continued use.</li>
            <li> and yet it performs better than any name brand s</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tangles easily and have not had any issues with tangles</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s gets my hair clean and has literally no &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> my hair feels nice and clean after each wash.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t be sudsy, and may not get the kind of clean that I&#x27;m used to PLUS keep the dandruff out.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very clean and seems to volumize my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair, which is fine, also has more volume and body with this shampoo, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo,natural and cleans great with out leaving heavy hair.great smell</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not lather up like a normal shampoo but is very effective in removing oil without over drying out your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have not washed my hair for 6 days and it still looks clean!</li>
            <li> While it cleans my hair very good, I get my hair oily the very next day.</li>
            <li> First, it arrived quickly and in very nice box.</li>
            <li> it is free from Fragrance, which is where many companies hide toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> yeah, this stuff is great so far.</li>
            <li> I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month, and I gotta say that It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is truly sulfate free, alcohol free and safe to use for people who are allergic to so many things that are put into shampoos today.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leaves hair looking great with a natural shine</li>
            <li> It really cleans her hair good and helps to keep the oils at a minimum.</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was super fast ... happy customer here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a natural shampoo without sulfates and this product is very nice.  </li>
            <li> (my teenage daughter even requested I buy it again after running out - impressive since kids are often more interested in chasing trends or what ever is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> clean and healthy product thank you</li>
            <li> love the clean.</li>
            <li> The whispy flyaways and easy breakage went away.</li>
            <li> But I had to stop using it very quickly because it was hurting a lot my scalp during all the day.</li>
            <li> You MADE IT ALL EASY AND</li>
            <li> NO other shampoo has ever made my hair feel this great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the bright idea to try this shampoo on the dogs (one of them having longer hair, about 2-3&amp;#34; long strands), and it worked even better on them!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the kind of shampoo I was looking for.</li>
            <li> One note: you have to make sure your hair is thoroughly wet before application to get the best sudsing activity (although not necessary for a good cleansing).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was packed and shipped fine</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been losing any more hair than normal, but I&#x27;m not seeing all the amazing stuff people have been raving</li>
            <li> If I were to switch to a more bubbly shampoo without sacrificing ingredients and was willing to pay more, I would try Living Libations shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is fine when used with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is plentiful but baby fine with no body at all.  </li>
            <li> My fine hair didn&#x27;t like that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> but I am totally fine with that.</li>
            <li> (I have really fine hair, so any grease shows up).</li>
            <li> I use zero products on my hair aside from shampoo, and my hair had been fine for a week.</li>
            <li> everything is fine, thx</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased the product and thanks to Prime, received VERY quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Most of us in America need to get smart and stop letting the media/corporate cheats that sell cheap chemicals to us for a huge profits and tell us what is acceptable and healthy for us, while in fact are selling us poisonous chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best natural shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> This was my &amp;#34;I think I made a huge mistake&amp;#34; purchase after trying to go &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and no cancer or thinning hair later on.</li>
            <li> my hair oil/dirt free.</li>
            <li> If only I could go two days without washing my hair, this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be switching up with another sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> If sulfate free stuff starts to not work then once</li>
            <li> Some people have commented that this isn&#x27;t fragrance free.</li>
            <li> free shampoos and figured why stop there?  </li>
            <li> Also, the downside of an oil free scalp is even drier ends.</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and did a light combing and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I now buy it for use at home.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the shampoo but could not justify the price when contemplating reordering.</li>
            <li> it was sulfate free thinking</li>
            <li> My hair, on its own volition, goes from curly to wavy to straight.</li>
            <li> , I added a sulfate free conditioner to my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> Gluten free.</li>
            <li> Gluten free.</li>
            <li> This product sounds great, but the only thing &amp;#34;EXTREME&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I&#x27;ve used this same shampoo since I purchased it and haven&#x27;t had to switch!</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;gulp&amp;#62; I used it several more times, but I always have to have some good conditioner to apply</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shampoo and the only one I have every found to make my hair look and feel amazing!</li>
            <li> It went through my hair pretty well with a good scalp massage, and washed out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> in all: Super duper great shampoo, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend for people with oily hair!</li>
            <li> I use the normal to oily formula, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super fine</li>
            <li> I was willing to spend this amount for shampoo every time if it worked because people have been claiming that they have been able to go longer days without washing their hair and suffering the oily roots.</li>
            <li> The price tag is too steep, but the good thing is you really do not need to use much to get a good wash.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, cleaning shampoo for someone with normal to oily hair who has to shampoo every day.  </li>
            <li> Soap nuts are good for laundry, too, and apparently work well for shampoos.</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair, doesn&#x27;t really have a (strong) smell and does the job!</li>
            <li> Simply the best natural shampoo</li>
            <li> I tried no poo, coconut milk and dr. bronners but my hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li> Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Gluten Free! -</li>
            <li> At this moment, I&#x27;m using it when I clean my hair before I henna it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say out of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (clarifying, traditional, natural), the one that does the best job is the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Hair is shiny and clean after wash, but if conditioner is not used don&#x27;t bother brushing your hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to no suds you will notice shine, softness, stays clean longer between shampoos because you are not putting grease in hair.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m getting all of my hair clean if it isn&#x27;t lathered.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have to use the product twice - wash - rinse - repeat but it leaves my hair squeaky clean</li>
            <li> (she spent so many years straightening it, we both though the curls were gone for good).</li>
            <li> So natural and lovely results!</li>
            <li> I was Pleasantly surprised, and Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair clean and full of body and there is no need for conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve be using this for the last six months and my hair is pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> I have dyed bright red hair.</li>
            <li> and it even smells pretty good, which is not always the case with natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> Look into it, soap berries from Greenwill are amazing and the whole reason I got into the Soap berry in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to reduce the number of chemicals in my body, so it is nice to have an all natural product that works as described.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased and tried many shampoos for my son who has very oily hair and seborreah</li>
            <li> I also have finally settled on a good soap too,</li>
            <li> I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> In that time, my hair got stonger and did a full detox, but over time it never stopped being oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there that promises to thicken and volumize but nothing has ever really ever worked leaving me with too many embarrassing &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; to count.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fit, eat right, take in plenty of exercise and water so my hair should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and usually my hair does great with sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> :) I do like how clean it gets my hair, though, so I will probably continue buying it, but only for an every now and then shampoo. :)</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my hair feel soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever found for my hair (thin, fine and oily).</li>
            <li> I really feel like my hair and scalp become very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go through a major &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34; phase and the first bottle was well loved.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, fresh smelling, and manageable without conditioner.</li>
            <li> price is comparable to what I was paying at the salon but this works better on my hair, is better for my hair, and it seems like it&#x27;s going to last longer!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shining, there is no need to wash them every day as after using this shampoo my hair does not get oily as quickly as before.</li>
            <li> Although they did helped to make my hair look decent, every time I had to do my hair, it worried me how many toxic chemicals i was putting in my scalp.</li>
            <li> Shipment is super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> So I had to have a second opinion because I couldn&#x27;t believe this stuff could really be this great.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as all the shampoos with detergents in them, but if you follow the directions it suds up well enough to be able to feel it throughout your hair (and I have a lot of it)!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She tried it and her hair was glorious - shiny and beautiful with all of the curls she had when she was a little girl</li>
            <li> but I was concerned about the healthy issues for using high alcohol based products.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt very clean, and looked white and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  </li>
            <li> I went a couple of weeks without a conditioner when first trying the product and my hair threw a fit.  </li>
            <li> but I was becoming very worried about the loss I was seeing</li>
            <li> I knew there had to be something better out there (products that were environmentally friendly and with natural ingredients).</li>
            <li> Wanting to find a good natural shampoo, I tried the NaturOli Normal to Oily.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather much when you first put it on, but if you rinse and repeat it works much better.  </li>
            <li> This stuff cleans y hair at a  good price and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved how little my hair changed when I switched to this product; it works as well as any chemically-laced shampoo, and you can feel safe that your hair isn&#x27;t soaking in cancerous gel ;D</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very soft and is more manageable.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this (the most REAL natural shampoo I could find), and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> and VERY hard for me to believe unless I actually experienced it!)</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t needed to use a conditioner, and very little styling products because my hair now lays in place beautifully.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist constantly reminds me how amazing my hair looks for my age.</li>
            <li> My scalp is amazing different!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I wish I had discovered it earlier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into my second bottle and it has continued to work amazingly for controlling my oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i compensate that later with my nubian heritage hair mousse, amazing scent.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product when I started looking into more natural products.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the purity of the product.  </li>
            <li> I love knowing that all the ingredients are all natural and there aren&#x27;t preservatives in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This one lathers nicely, has essentially no scent, and leaves my hair looking and feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, I used this shampoo twice and my scalp is already 95 % better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is worth the money.</li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li> It will take a month, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I missed the suds, they were nice to have back.  </li>
            <li> If I do use hairspray (rare occasions) I will have to wash and rinse through twice.  </li>
            <li> I would like to thanks Amazon for not only being a purchase tool but for become a great platform that really make a better world giving us the opportunity to discover natural products that saves lifes</li>
            <li> This shampoo is well worth it, and you can tell how well it works immediately after your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s results will vary depending on their body chemistry, but this shampoo&#x27;s worth a try, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive scalp that most shampoos cause to break out and itch, this shampoo seems to minimize problems.</li>
            <li> Well worth a try in my opinion.</li>
            <li> am sensitive to most skin and hair products.</li>
            <li> but this is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m back here at Amazon.com to buy a couple more bottles of this fantastic shampoo as I think mine is in danger of disappearing into the girls&#x27; apartment</li>
            <li> I tried going &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for three months and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results but still wanted a natural product and came by this.</li>
            <li> Hair gets oily pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> They screw right on your shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will notice right away that your hair and scalp are really and simply clean...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself as having oily hair, but because my hair was fine, I chose the normal to oily variation of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I have normal to oily fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very pure and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is the only natural and chemical free shampoo that I tried that made my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, not coarse at all</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair clean, dry, and healthy even with all the dirt and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for a week, my hair becomes incredibly soft and easy to manage, not to mention the volumizing effect.</li>
            <li> It looked so nice partially dry</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products for my oily hair, but nothing worked as much as NaturOli did.&lt;br /&gt;Great feeling to use an all natural product and also have some terrific results.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for normal or normal-to-oily hair; I always use Sulfate-free products and I do feel that it is much less damaging to my hair (less split ends!), and I&#x27;m happy to have added this one to the tried list.</li>
            <li> A real winner!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how silky and shiny my hair was.  </li>
            <li> For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene.</li>
            <li> My top area feels pretty coarse</li>
            <li> I have definitely been doing that and more to no noticeable results at all.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still more oily than I hoped but overall improved.</li>
            <li> I do not wash my hair every day, as I have found that it actually makes my hair even more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a million shampoos and some might work for most of the day and maybe into the next day some</li>
            <li> If I have styling products in, I rinse with this shampoo twice, if not, only one rinse will do. :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of using more to try to get the same slippery, foamy feel out of this shampoo - you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I had to learn how to make everything myself, and it was pretty overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first bottle will go faster while it detoxes your scalp with multi washes per shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vegan, it does exactly as it says it does.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I read the instructions, and it does say that if your hair has been subjected to chemically induced shampoos that results may take a week.  </li>
            <li> I first tried &amp;#34;Silicone/Sulfate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I dove head first into the process of going without shampoo.  </li>
            <li> ready tosave the day if I start loosing hair!</li>
            <li> And you really can use it alone, without any conditioner!</li>
            <li> It worked after the first use.</li>
            <li> love that this shampoo actually foams.  </li>
            <li> It made me feel like it was working the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using these products for several months now, and am utterly in love.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Well, long story short, I haven&#x27;t experienced dandruff like that since, so I suppose (?)</li>
            <li> which would be the first time in my life..</li>
            <li> This shampoo is my first experience with soap nut &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was leery of this at first knowing</li>
            <li> First time in my life.</li>
            <li> Its so pretty and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Or I wish they could make bigger bottles :)</li>
            <li> but I cycle through 3 different shampoos and this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> I love all the extra benefits you get</li>
            <li> And it looks really pretty and shiny too.</li>
            <li> The first lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a good organic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but not really that much more amazing than any other natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves hair extremely clean and soft without use of more than a tiny drop of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> my hair looks healthy, doesn&#x27;t break and is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;For someone having scalp problems or for someone that just wants to use a natural product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use with my babies and the light scent is perfect - even for someone who typically looks for products without any essential oils.</li>
            <li> The original natural shampoo from from plants.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seriously can not believe how great this product is on my hair.</li>
            <li> early afternoon I can squeak two days of clean looking out of it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> although my hair still felt course while wet, the tangles became extremely easy to get rid of and my hair started becoming very soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many bottles of this shampoo and will never switch as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching to Morrocco Method&#x27;s shampoo which is working out better long term.</li>
            <li> think this shampoo helped me transition to better shampoo but long term</li>
            <li> At first, after about 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish it worked up into a better lather, but it does leave my hair really clean every time and I also deal with less frizz than I did before, even without any conditioner!</li>
            <li> Also, this leaves my hair frizzy, dry and prone to static.</li>
            <li> so your hair smells just like clean hair... if you are loosing hair, you can be sure that by your third or fourth wash it will stop falling...</li>
            <li> and she has beautiful, waist long dark blond hair -</li>
            <li> It certainly cleaned well, almost too well because it left my long, fine hair in so many tangles while trying to rinse it in the shower...</li>
            <li> I really do love it and think it would work great with anyone with average to thick hair or even curls.</li>
            <li> and my hair is manageble, i do smell some soapnuts and also feel slight dandruff, but overall it helped my hair fall problem, so i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am now in love with my hair  :) I have very oily hair and for the first two weeks it seem as if the shampoo was making it worse.</li>
            <li> I have color treated (streaked blonde) hair that is cotton candy fine.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over a week with really good results, but then we had a water filter installed (we had REALLY hard water).</li>
            <li> I liked it well enough and will probably get more and mix up a little natural conditioner to use with it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not very sudsy so make sure your hair is drenched in water before you lather it on and do it fast because it&#x27;s like putting a runny gel.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this shampoo, and plan on using up the entire bottle, as I really like it.</li>
            <li> Since I was looking for something completely organic and natural, this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> that I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not going to put any product on it&amp;#34; which is a huge big deal for</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very well  packed and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have very itchy skin after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t return, because I opened one</li>
            <li> I think this will work very well for you.</li>
            <li> I also have to add that the shipping is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that this shampoo balances secretion of oil glands very well in my scalp leaving it itch-free and</li>
            <li> This is a truly gentle and well cleansing product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really is everything everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> I only buy sulfate free shampoo and found this shampoo when looking for a clarifying shampoo w/out sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I have poker straight, medium brown untreated hair.</li>
            <li> So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> hair gets oily fast.</li>
            <li> I WOULD use some conditioner on the tips of my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t tangle so much.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not breaking as much either, even without conditioner.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> very recommend!Now</li>
            <li> and it is definitely very tangled after i wash it.  </li>
            <li> But i have come to realize if you dont wash the bottom ends of your hair very often (</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has oily hair, and she seems to really like the way it works.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but not a lot is required.</li>
            <li> I absolutely still have to use a conditioner with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> also it strips too much oil off my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very course straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten a bunch of compliments on how healthy my long dark hair looks and better than anything else,</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that any shampoo could make that much of a difference in a matter of one week</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product is an absolute ripoff.</li>
            <li> It tangles my hair too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks NaturOli</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say that I am very please with this sulfate and dimethicone-free shampoo is an understatement.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very please with it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> , I hope you like it as much as I</li>
            <li> It also really helps in protecting my hair from dryness.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Nature.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> This shampoo gently cleanses the scalp, by removing EXCESS oil from it, and from the hair.</li>
            <li> And, since my hair does not get greasy, the dust etc. does not stick to it as much.</li>
            <li> I have always has very oily skin and hair.</li>
            <li> it did take about a week for my hair to adapt to the shampoo as noted in the instructions, but I highly recommend this product and will be ordering the laundry and kitchen products as well!</li>
            <li> Actually I really like this</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> We are trying to stay away from chemicals, there&#x27;s too much of that going on.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the smelling oil and keeps it very shiny.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a real cheapskate</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it had more volume even though it was wet.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely be using this product for years to come and suggest it to friends.</li>
            <li> but regardless I&#x27;ve never had so much bounce and volume in my hair</li>
            <li> that keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair from looking oily so fast.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found a natural product that works and</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a pleasant, subtle scent, that does not stick to my hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, a company with an honest ingredient list that actually works and lives up to its advertising!</li>
            <li> Lets just say this: When I got my hair cut last, the hair salon stylist was AMAZED at how healthy and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> It stopped falling out (after the plain soapberry liquid) and is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several sulfate-free shampoos and this one is both gentle on my hair and gets it clean without leaving a build up.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of the shampoo, so don&#x27;t try to work up a big lather, as that is not needed to clean the hair.</li>
            <li> If i wash every other day, I have much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other shampoos give you healthy LOOKING hair.</li>
            <li> Taking care of it and keeping it clean is a constant battle for me.</li>
            <li> I went on my cleansing adventure to find a way to score an extra day of clean looking hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I also tolerated the grease for long enough to see whether or not it was going to improve on its own.</li>
            <li> My hair fell quite naturally into the beautiful cut my stylist gave me, and the ends seemed sealed/thick (which I&#x27;ve never experienced).</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t lather quite like most shampoos we&#x27;re used to; however, I found that watering it down in your hands really brings out the sudsiness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say it has made a huge difference to my hair, but considering it is all natural with none of the nasty things some shampoos contain, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very, very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> so finding something that doesn&#x27;t leave hard water residue in my hair has been very challenging.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is totally natural and works better than the Progaine itself, leave my hair dry as I want.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and unruly ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The absolute last straw was at my most recent salon visit when I was told my hair is thinning - a LOT.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t consider wanting real and natural products a trend.</li>
            <li> Glad to have one less step in the shower.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has no particular smell, but that&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li> sulfate free is the way to go when you have dry curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> my expectations of this product are less oil, more health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to everything, from sound, smells, and chemicals, but a recent allergic reaction caused me to start reacting to almost everything in my life, from detergent, to shampoo, to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I still have most of the bottle, it does lather but it takes a bit of rubbing to get it going, and it doesn&#x27;t build up the same way with regular shampoo, not that I was expecting it to.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, if I can find a SUPER conditioner that is non-toxic, I may keep using this shampoo on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My hair did not need a conditioner, was light and soft, and still felt that way they next day!</li>
            <li> :-)&lt;br /&gt;I only need to wash my hair once every two to three days, and am guessing my bottle of shampoo will last me about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I know thinning of the hair happens as we get older, but I just don&#x27;t have any hair to spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the product because it gently cleans my hair without irritating my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but once it did, Wow!  Commercial shampoos never made my hair look half as good.</li>
            <li> I let it sit a few minutes and quickly rinse with cool water.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those of us with normal/oily hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> IF you are looking for an organic solution to your shampooing routine I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will not go back to the other kind.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally oily long hair.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean, my hair feels soft but by the next day my scalp is itchy and hair oily again.</li>
            <li> , the suds are soft and gentle, and not like one would expect from a shampoo, but it cleaned my hair &amp;#34;squeaky-clean&amp;#34;!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became extremely soft and whispy, but now some strands stick straight up.</li>

            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair</li>
            <li> first wash, I did one rinse and light shampoo, followed by one heavy lather and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My housemates (all guys who normally don&#x27;t pay attention to this sort of thing) compliment my hair and want to try this out.</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp with normal hair.</li>
            <li> , I decided to use Naturoli for normal to oily</li>
            <li> My hair is \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is recommended for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li> more itching scalp after harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is because the first time it doesn&#x27;t latter much for me, however the second time, It lathers nicely.--Also, my hair gets very tangled, and at first I was inclined to buy another organic and natural detangler, but decided not to, I just learned to be patient and gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li> Not the case with NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo normal to oily hair.  </li>
            <li> ran out of this for about two days and had to use &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I immediately used a conditioner after that, in hopes to counter the drying effects of the normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my hair, it actually worked really well.</li>
            <li> have since switched to Carina Organics Pure &amp; Natural Daily Moisturizing Shampoo, Pure &amp; Natural Daily Light Conditioner and Pure &amp; Natural Dandruff Flake Removal Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just to keep down on the frizz that my hair naturally does, I also spray my hair with coconut oil. :)</li>
            <li> My hair would feel ultra soft and clean right after rinsing but by the next day, my scalp would be itchy and hair flat from all the oil.</li>
            <li> I tried using less shampoo, because some websites said that soft water doesn&#x27;t rinse as well, and I tried using MORE shampoo...</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, because I was starting down the path to rid my life of as many chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li> It took build up off, my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy, my hair was soft and clean and it really surprised me that it actually worked.</li>
            <li> ;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gluten free and have problems with other &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In the oily formula it&#x27;s the only shampoo (and we&#x27;ve tried SO MANY, natural, not natural)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try some of NaturOli&#x27;s other products and highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> But this is my new shampoo</li>
            <li> The only problem it that I have to use so much to make it really lather on my head.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does what it says as far as balancing the natural oil secretion in your scalp.</li>
            <li> I carefully researched products that would be environmentally safe for water that could possibly reach our pond and thus the fish that we might eat.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling smooth after you wash off the shampoo, it actually feels the opposite.</li>
            <li> I liked the Castile soap, but it left my hair feeling somewhat heavy, perhaps from the glycerin.</li>
            <li> My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap.</li>
            <li> So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more.</li>
            <li> so I use it about every other time--but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Because this one is so expensive I&#x27;ve tried many others natural and synthetic fragrance free shampoos hoping I can switch to something cheaper</li>
            <li> Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then.</li>
            <li> I definitely lost more hair using this shampoo than the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo or other shampoos</li>
            <li> This is the first non-damaging shampoo I&#x27;ve found that I actually LIKE!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this shampoo, due to all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> We like it much better than the chemical washes we used in the past.</li>
            <li> but if anyone is struggling with hair that&#x27;s clean one day, extra oily the next, and always itchy</li>
            <li> I did not notice a smell other than clean from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> thought that this product might offer me an alternative to making my own shampoo (which had been disappointing and frustrating) and from all the product reviews I was sure that it would be safe for me.</li>
            <li> Not only a big saving but also a step in the right direction to help our environment!</li>
            <li> when light hits jet black hair, it&#x27;s shiny.</li>
            <li> and this is the only natural shampoo that consistently works for me.  </li>
            <li> I actually &#x27;felt&#x27; how much the &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo was stripping from my hair.</li>
            <li> once I dried my hair, it was so shiny, strong and manageable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick fine (Asian) hair and my roots/bangs area can get oily in a day and will show readily on day 2 if not washed again.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos are full of chemicals and fragrance that just seemed to aggrevate things.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left a bizarre film on my hair and made my head and face feel very strange.  </li>
            <li> I mix in a little 100% Pure brand kids shampoo to make it smell fun.</li>
            <li> I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of</li>
            <li> many other reviewers, once my hair was dry it felt soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this shampoo, I was literally starting to bald from losing so much hair (for reference, I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> After making the switch to an all natural lifestyle, shampoo was the hardest for me to give up.</li>
            <li> Natural, no harsh chemicals, sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, with not itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Left hair with a very greasy feeling, like it just took the oil off your scalp and redistributed it all over your hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I kept telling myself I needed time to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; from my old shampoos, but if a product cannot produce results after using it exclusively for months, then it&#x27;s not going to work for</li>
            <li> have tried the no-poo method (i.e. giving up shampoo completely)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for the Holy Grail of natural, oily-hair shampoos.</li>
            <li> So, I started looking for a truly natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you want organic and natural..........</li>
            <li> When I switched to a natural shampoo I wanted something with suds.</li>
            <li> (darn you natural stuff)</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft and smells alright too.</li>
            <li> My hair is as soft and manageble as it is with the salon product.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural shampoo and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> The later isn&#x27;t very plentiful, but that&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it to make it overly sudsy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old, and do not want to become bald.  </li>
            <li> this product has cleared out all the chemicals from my hair with has been mistreated with every hair color under the sun since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has lathered up quite well and rinsed out</li>
            <li> My family purchased this product when we bought a cabin near a sensitive eco-system.  </li>
            <li> I let the product sit in my hair for 5 mins before rinsing out (in hope that my hair can absorb all the nutrients from the shampoo&#x27;s natural ingredients).</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from chemicals in my beauty care products, and so began looking for things which claimed to be natural or organic.</li>
            <li> not too wild about his shampoo.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to go through a detox phase because i always use natural hair products.</li>

            <li> B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nut / Soapberry Shampoo 16oz Organic Natural Hair Care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, has lots of volume (which has always been my #1 priority), and stays hydrated plus (no splint ends so far) and</li>
            <li> I have tried several organic, sulfate free, low chemical shampoos and they all left my hair clumpy and oily.  </li>
            <li> although arguably a chemical, this is the natural way to go.</li>
            <li> We also use coconut none scented soap and are in process of changing our underarm deodorant to be natural.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well with soft water.</li>
            <li> I am a &#x27;natural&#x27; girl when it comes to products.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t stop commenting on it and about five different people felt my hair that day (hahaha).  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural shampoo for my prepubescent daughter.</li>
            <li> I was VERY hesitant to buy it when I read a couple of reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional shampoo (again, my fear of dirty/flat hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed five times so far ....</li>
            <li> At the price I paid, I would have liked to go at least a day without my hair turning oily, especially because it states this shampoo is for normal/oily hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and clean (but hard to detangle) and it didn&#x27;t change my shower routine much.</li>
            <li> shampoo gets rid of the oiliness, but my hair now gets extremely frizzy and breaks more easily (possibly because Naturoli does such a thorough job of getting rid of all oil).</li>
            <li> I used this Great Sulfate free shampoo as a healthier base and added my essential oils to it to heal and naturally renew my Aunt Deve&#x27;s scalp,skin, and quality of life back to normal.</li>
            <li> First week was tangly and dry but it improved after that.</li>
            <li> the only thing that got my hair back to being clean and shiny was to go out and buy a regular Herbal Essences shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like a little bit of a clean smelling shampoo</li>
            <li> I like using soap nuts to clean with and do laundry, so I decided to try this soapberry shampoo since I wanted to get away from all the shampoos and conditioners with harsh chemicals and toxins in them.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves my hair and scalp clean without being dried out.  </li>
            <li> After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner for the first time ever and my hair actually still has bounce the next day.</li>
            <li> While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and order it as soon as the bottle becomes low</li>
            <li> Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time.</li>
            <li> I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and it feels clean, slightly textured, and soft.  </li>
            <li> If you brush your hair thoroughly before showering then you dont need an additional conditioner but otherwise its pretty rough.</li>
            <li> I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time.</li>
            <li> so I wash twice and the second lather is always nice and soapy like the first on a regular creepy chemical shampoo.</li>
            <li> Most other shampoos still contain harsh detergents that damage your hair, even though they claim to be organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes dry ends without making the scalp oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dye my hair or over style it or even blow dry it much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap.</li>
            <li> oil managing ingredients, my hair does not get oily as the day winds down, nor right after shampooing with some shampoos.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, NO other conditioners needed.</li>
            <li> I will use no other.  </li>
            <li> No other conditioners, or products are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could barely pull my fingers out because it was so tangled!</li>
            <li> I always would resort back to a salon name brand shampoo which has so many toxins in it but would leave my hair feeling soft an not oily- at least till the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it lathered up in the shower just as much as any other shampoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost, as I have either eliminated or cut way back on all of the other styling products.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, but leaves my hair very dry, and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Then, when I combed through my hair, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and thick it felt</li>
            <li> I think that plus the general goodness of the shampoo is helping my hair growth, as my hair is shinier, a bit stronger, and has no dandruff.</li>
            <li> but this bottle seems to last a long time since you don&#x27;t need to use a  whole lot.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair; with all other shampoos (even sulfate and gluten free shampoos), my hair is always oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought a trial size and got about 4 uses out of it and in that short amount of time it completely calmed my scalp.</li>
            <li> A natural, American made product that works as well as anything else.</li>
            <li> far the results are the same.</li>
            <li> but this.....this is by far different from the rest.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been three weeks, and so far I don&#x27;t see anything different about my hair than when I was using Avalon shampoos.  </li>
            <li> : I definitely recommend this shampoo if you are conscious of the products you use on your hair and body, and know that nothing here will damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I try to use only organic, natural based products.</li>
            <li> I can tell that when I brush my wet hair after getting out of the shower, the brush goes straight through it...where before it would be tangled.</li>
            <li> they were just chasing what they would likely consider a trend to be natural.</li>
            <li> AND I had some of my natural curl back that I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft with no conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my hair soft and shiny and If I had thicker hair, this would be the only shampoo for me.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that waaay more of my hair than normal came out in the wash, which I noticed several other people complained about.</li>
            <li> Just trust that using a normal amount - I use about 2 quarter-size globs for my very long hair - will get the job done.</li>
            <li> So I will probably try their normal to dry formula</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample sizes of this one and the one for normal to dry hair from naturOli web-site.</li>
            <li> Normal to Dry.</li>
            <li> Normal to Dry.</li>
            <li> It got my hair clean with a small quarter size dollop--my hair is in a pixie cut--and lathered up like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> was after using Extreme Hair because it didn&#x27;t do much to soften it, however it worked wonders for my irritated scalp.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps the medical condition, but really takes care of the oily hair.  </li>
            <li> not of high quality, it is very thick and gelatinous, like jello, it takes about double to three times as much product as other shampoos I have used, just to get my hair soapy and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> To be clear though, this Soapnut/Soapberry shampoo has not entirely rid my hair of all oil or tiny flakes, so I took one star off.</li>
            <li> Not made for natural African American hair!</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your hair and it does not leave it oily either.  </li>
            <li> The first week of use, I was a little iffy.  </li>
            <li> I live in a place with a very dry climate (Arizona)</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again, but I&#x27;m glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, as it was a bit difficult to run a comb through my long hair when it was wet.</li>
            <li> At first I tried fundamental earth fundamental shampoo (lavender) but it made my hair too dry and extremely knotty.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft and shiny when dry.</li>
            <li> After using this in conjunction with my normal conditioner after a week, my hair is oily by the third day, but I guess that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive, but definitely worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She normally washes her hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I started having to shower every day (normally I shower every other day), but it wasn&#x27;t helping...</li>
            <li> guess cause I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos for half a year now, there was no &amp;#34;buildup&amp;#34; for this one to clear away.  </li>
            <li> Also, definitely no conditioner needed - just as w/ any truly natural shampoo, let your hair dry before brushing.</li>
            <li> This really helps with static, tangles, and hard water residue (if you have hard water like we do!).</li>
            <li> But my hair is so fine and thin that this does not help at all.  </li>
            <li> but if you have fine thin hair like I do it will leave you with even thinner looking hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad though, and I actually learned that this is commonly mistaken as dandruff, but in reality, dandruff doesnt flake and is instead larger chunks (usually yellow not white) attached to the scalp.</li>
            <li> The normal to dry variation has guar gum, which I assume is used to protect dry hair.</li>
            <li> The shampooing experience isn&#x27;t quite as fun bc although it lathers it&#x27;s hard to get it all through your hair.</li>
            <li> Whether due to stress, getting older, weather - whatever the reason, hair was coming out in the shower and combing out my long hair resulted in clumps.  </li>
            <li> I tried using less, more, multiple washes, hot or cold rinses -</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product very much, but it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> There was a less than to a normal amount of foam.</li>
            <li> The strands I find on my comb amount to what would probably be considered normal, maybe even less.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my hair feel like I just stepped out of an expensive salon, it feels soft and full of body three days later!  </li>
            <li> Before, with other products, I was just feeling that my hair was soft and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> All other gray water ran out near our pond.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this shampoo to work, but after 3 months of exclusive use, I have found that it performs no better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s All-in-one soap (which I also do not like for all the same reasons).  </li>
            <li> Only toilet water drained into our septic tank.  </li>
            <li> the second bottle my hair was feeling too dry (even with regular oil treatments) and my scalp was flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product like you would &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; - just small amounts, gently massaging into the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally coarse hair and an oily scalp</li>
            <li> I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to do some research on shampoos and thinning hair, long story short, I landed on Naturoli Soap Nuts shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive, kind of peeved that I spent all this money and it made my hair worse than before I started using it</li>
            <li> Left it dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Others either left my hair extremely dry or stopped working after a week.</li>
            <li> I felt like others left my hair feeling dirty/unwashed or way too dry.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better than I was doing, which was dirty looking by mid afternoon after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried reapplying it to see if that would help; and it slightly did, but was still far too tangled, so I had to grab for the trusty back-up, Pantene Conditioner to help de-knot my hair.</li>
            <li> Baking soda and vinegar left my hair dry and waxy, honey didn&#x27;t remove the oil</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it was like my previous natural shampoo</li>
            <li> Thus, less frequent washing required.</li>
            <li> I have super thin, baby-fine hair that needs a ton of products just to get it to look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I found it odd that the ingredient lists on these so-called natural products continued to be unnecessarily long with ingredients I didn&#x27;t recognize, or couldn&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed red, so I try to wash it as least often as possible and use natural products only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, Asian, male with short black hair.</li>
            <li> but I use much less of it than I did conventional shampoo and conditioner, and I only need to use it twice a week, as opposed to daily with the old stuff.  </li>
            <li> I may try the shampoo for dry hair and switch back and forth using the two, since my color treated hair tends to dry out--I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I need to do this.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issues with my hair is how oily it gets, how dull it looks without product, and how much I shed.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp does seem to itch less and there are much less white flakes near my scalp, in comparison (probably because my scalp used to be dry, or because there is a lot of buildup from other hair products).</li>
            <li> Over the past couple years I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different natural shampoos and I&#x27;ve even tried going</li>
            <li> No more heavy bottles of detergent to lift, which are mostly water anyway, no more fabric softeners, etc.</li>
            <li> I made this decision after carefully reviewing products as found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database found at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse.php?atatime&#x3D;50&amp;category&#x3D;shampoo&amp;order&#x3D;webscore_INC&amp;&amp;showmore&#x3D;products&amp;start&#x3D;0.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, my hair is quite long and it does tend to tangle.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that tends to be oily.</li>
            <li> have oily, thick, long hair and have tried different sulfate free shampoos, organic shampoos and have not liked any of them.  </li>
            <li> And as long as the product is on the market, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, with a combination of sometimes oily scalp and semi-dry ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and I either get gloss or sometimes, highlights.</li>
            <li> Give this product a couple weeks to start working as it will long term.  </li>
            <li> I only get my haircut every 2-3 months, so I was curious to see if my hairdresser would notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Well, it turns out that these products were not natural after all...</li>
            <li> After using this product for so long, I noticed an immediate difference when washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair daily and by mid day, my hair would feel weighed down and oily again.  </li>
            <li> But most of the time I felt like I was just pouring soap into my hair, and getting it to lather was next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> i mean like, once a week maybe) and just massage your scalp with the soap and ABSOLUTELY brush your hair before you shower</li>
            <li> Have tried only two other shampoos to see if any compare to this in quality</li>
            <li> Other shampoos regularly after a few washes (or less) get pimple like bumps on the scalp especially on the back of my neck when it apparently doesn&#x27;t wash out well or something.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird feeling; my scalp felt almost squeaky clean during the shower, but every evening it would feel greasy again.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how this does in winter time in the northeast when my scalp is usually horribly dry</li>
            <li> It gets tangled and a bit dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> My son had dry scalp and oily hair.</li>
            <li> After the shower it seems tangly and dry</li>
            <li> , I have a problem with dry ends</li>
            <li> did not use conditioner, but once my hair was dry, I put a dab of Christina Moss&#x27;s conditioner in my palm, rubbed my hands together, and ran them through my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any products, and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Aunt Deve who&#x27;s scalp was so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp but the hair tends to get oily (can&#x27;t figure it out).  </li>
            <li> It felt DRY while I was washing it.</li>
            <li> I even bought the norm to dry for my sister</li>
            <li> but I do wait to brush my hair until it is dry.</li>
            <li> but my hair never feels dry.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was not sure about not needing conditioner as I have long hair and have always put tons of conditioner in my hair to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> and I think it will make anyone&#x27;s hair better; thick, thin, dry, oily, etc.</li>
            <li> (single dad of 6)</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet if I like it, takes some getting used to a natural shampoo</li>
            <li> unbelievably, the amount of hair I was losing every day has come to almost a complete stop.  </li>
            <li> Applying a medium to small amount into my hair, lather, and rinsing, the shampoo leaves my hair soft and not overly dried-out like some shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of their claim that you &#x27;don&#x27;t need conditioner&#x27; but, to my surprise, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier, lighter weight and less likely to tangle.</li>
            <li> shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, and has no particular scent.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, but I feel like I am using a little less each time, as all the old residues are washed</li>
            <li> Talk about a tangled mess, but I wasn&#x27;t going back to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> having baby fine hair means there&#x27;s no way to cover up when it&#x27;s the slightest bit dirty or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally really dry, long, thin hair, but i still chose to purchase the one for normal to oily hair as the alternative leaves my hair feeling oily after drying.</li>
            <li> I only wash every other day because miraculously it helps keep my grease down.</li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s a little overpriced considering the size of the bottle, but for an organic option I guess you can expect some extra expense.</li>
            <li> At least this is a natural soap,</li>
            <li> Not much suds, but</li>
            <li> absolutely no itching or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I recommend for those who, like me, find commercial shampoos too harsh.  </li>
            <li> and I am not ready for that.</li>
            <li> I went crying back to, told me that whatever I was using was helping.</li>
            <li> I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower and just comb through my hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really no difference.  </li>
            <li> Which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> but it is a litter harder to brush/comb when wet.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair overly fluffy.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> You also must buy &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34; here on amazon to use with this product.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe I spent money on this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already spent the money so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> The first days were a bit weird, since it would make my hair &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; together while I was washing it (although it went away as soon as I got dry) but this feeling disappeared after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> two to three small latherings will do the trick (don&#x27;t do a single big lathering, it won&#x27;t work as well).  </li>
            <li> Unlike other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one lathers like crazy.</li>
            <li> I washed about 20 loads so far and the volume of the bottle has hardly gone down.</li>
            <li> When I first began my vegan journey I was shocked to find that my Natural Suave (Coconut) shampoo and conditioner had honey in it and, of course, tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that my sweet Angel of a Aunt has no more dry itching scalp and skin problems.</li>
            <li> ( which is not often because a little goes a LONG way)....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I do not use a conditioner on her hair, it is impossible to brush and knotts up easily which happens with any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Also, the shampoo leaves the hair feeling dry and definitely NOT TRUE that you don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner after.</li>
            <li> We live in Germany and have VERY hard water</li>
            <li> that does not leave my skin flaky and itchy like all the other soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> Even my daughter, who has scoffed at my other shampoos, loves this.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I am now washing my hair every other day because it&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t matter if I washed every other day, or once every 4 days</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and don&#x27;t shampoo the other days.</li>
            <li> - \\&quot;EXTREME</li>
            <li> It also rinses faster and cleaner than other shampoo</li>
            <li> I now have no problems just washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> It states you don&#x27;t need conditioner or other products....not.  </li>
            <li> No more finding hair following out in the shower either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that keeps my hair from looking horribly greasy for more than a day, and it only starts to get oily after two or three days.</li>
            <li> Switched from a semi-natural shampoo that I used every other day to this.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not absolutely in love with it</li>
            <li> If you miss a foamy or sudsy feeling, wash a second time with just a small bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit harsher than the other.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The sodium laurel sulfate and other chemicals in the liquid form of soaps are not helping her condition at ALL.  </li>
            <li> I also use Greenwill SoapBerries around the house for all kinds of other reasons.</li>
            <li> ; about it is the extreme price tag.</li>
            <li> I may look at some of this company&#x27;s other products as well.</li>
            <li> It takes two or three times to soap the hair to remove filth due to organic ingredients and a lot of oil extracts in shampoo.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no build up on the hair,  and even though my hair is long I have very little hair that falls out when I shampoo,  when I used to get handfuls with all other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is very greasy and dirty feeling by the next morning.</li>
            <li> No more mussing up the hair in a big lather - I keep the ends down at the bottom</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I am still losing much hair as before with other shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just remember that it can take at least 2 weeks for your hair to transition from any other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; - or especially unnatural shampoo.</li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves her her a little bit harder to comb.</li>
            <li> Use every other day or less.</li>
            <li> It left my hair waxy and no matter how hard I tried to scrub my scalp</li>
            <li> Which if you have red hair, you know how hard it is it keep the color.</li>
            <li> only it were little cheaper!!</li>
            <li> but it is much too expensive...</li>
            <li> For reference - I have a lot of hair, but it is thin, long and obviously oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used expensive yet gentle shampoos</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of Soapberry shampoo, as it leaves my hair lustrous and thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the product is quite pricy, it is thick and you only need to use a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of slathering on the these lab concoctions they call natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using organic and natural shampoo for years and have never experienced anything like this.  </li>
            <li> The one with the longer hair got little tangles in his hair, too, just like I did, but luckily his hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as mine because it wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as mine.</li>
            <li> but I let it dry a little and, once I got through the heavy tangles, my hair was as manageable as if I had used conditioner.</li>
            <li> You have to allow your hair at least a month to detoxify itself from the residue left from your typical shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t a bunch of stuff weighing it down.</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair even oiler and ways it down after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> and my wife started using the other one, so both are used a little.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and cleaner after using this product than any other shampoo+conditioner products!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other products with soapberries!</li>
            <li> EXTREME Hair is made with USDA organic soap nuts / soap berries!</li>
            <li> EXTREME Hair is made with USDA organic soap nuts / soap berries!</li>
            <li> I previously had to use a smoothing/straightening conditioner and plaster my hair down with styling products to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shampoo everyday due to climate and skin issue</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try it since I read some negative reviews, especially the one where a woman said she started losing her hair bec.</li>
            <li> bought nuclear waste or what ever they put in that other stuff.</li>
            <li> I also re-wet my hair half way through washing to help move the shampoo around to areas I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly oily, BUT, not noticeably.</li>
            <li> so my scalp can get flaky, sometimes half a day after shampooing.</li>
            <li> With that taken into consideration I spend less just using this one product.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing half the bottle away.</li>
            <li> so it gets less tangled and less need for any conditioner.</li>
            <li> Day by day I notice the hair is less oily.</li>
            <li> Ive also received compliments on how jet black</li>
            <li> but that are less expensive, and so far one other is a close tie with this in terms of quality, but still may buy this again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair in a tangled mess</li>
            <li> My scalp was left with a film that would cause it to itch, something that I never experienced with other shampoos</li>
            <li> Just a small note: it may take a week or so to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; hair and scalp of common chemical residue and buildup as stated on bottle which is true if you have used other shampoos that contain parabens, propylene, butylene glycols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances.</li>
            <li> This review might be a little premature, but I&#x27;ll update as time passes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> feels like it&#x27;s drying my hair a little bit</li>
            <li> It does lather a little so it helps to get it through your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little spendy but this is the way I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, aaaah thick shampoo that isn&#x27;t just liquid!</li>
            <li> Although typical conditioners helped tame the frizz, all I use now is a bit of Moroccan Argan Oil and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was a little hard to comb through wet</li>
            <li> you are used to using regular shampoo, you will have a bit of a tough time transitioning to NaturOli as it won&#x27;t get all foamy like you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> personally, i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought two and see now that wasted the money.</li>
            <li> If you value green living and don&#x27;t have horrid, unruly hair (like mine)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because sometimes natural products don&#x27;t work as well as chemical laden ones.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for my hair to detox</li>
            <li> They keep their shape without being limp or floppy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been missing the silken feel on all parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde colored hair and was hoping this would moisturize the ends as it cleansed</li>
            <li> Alright, well, I wanted to wait until I&#x27;ve used this product a few times before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also upset that I can not return this item, so I really wasted $20.</li>
            <li> but once it has dried a bit you can comb it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks of almost everyday use, I started having A LOT of dandruff...</li>
            <li> but hair felt coated and heavy after that.  </li>
            <li> Therefore the oil glands in the skin do not kick into overdrive to replace missing oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but still cheaper than some of the salon brands.</li>
            <li> Money wasted I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing my hair less (every three days or so) for the past year</li>
            <li> I also follow up with a vinegar rinse due to our hard water.</li>
            <li> I freaked out and before trying again with the plain berries and a thicker conditioner, I found NaturOli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to using this shampoo, I was experiencing hair loss at a dramatic rate.  </li>
            <li> It was just a greasy mess!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but on the plus side, I can go an embarrassingly long time without needing to wash it so it lasts longer than other products.  </li>
            <li> I hate writing a poor review on a good product, but I take serious issues with the price!</li>
            <li> this is daughters favorite..doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp..or leave a residue behind</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and made it hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> But I like the product, because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff that we really don&#x27;t need in it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this shampoo makes my hair oily, it kills the purpose of buying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used practically every brand in the past, from Tide to bargain ones, but none of them did the job as well.</li>
            <li> I usually go for volumizing shampoos, to give my hair fullness.</li>
            <li> It did work, but no more so than the olive oil soap I have resorted to.</li>
            <li> Only dawback is it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No more tangles, people compliment my hair for it&#x27;s softness, and shine.  </li>
            <li> only complaints are it&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Not sure yet on this item since I just started using it</li>
            <li> I was suffering from dandruff this past winter.  </li>
            <li> no more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is no better than any that you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I usually ALWAYS have to use a conditioner or else my hair will feel like straw after washing it.</li>
            <li> No more irritated skin.</li>
            <li> No more overwashed hair, that turns oily after couple of days.</li>
            <li> even my husband loves it and he usually just uses bar soap.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually have to wash it for another day.  </li>
            <li> no more oily scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a conditioner and moisturizer but not anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair has no body at all and falls very limp.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo for those that don&#x27;t want to expose your hair to nasty, harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I do find myself needing to use a bit of it since my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is that my hair is that by the end of the day, my hair is already getting greasy and my scalp is dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dull dirty-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I hardly EVER write reviews</li>
            <li> I had gotten a really bad perm and they screwed my hair up and my old hair dresser</li>
            <li> If I wash my hair in the late morning/</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy, colored hair, for the record.</li>
            <li> The build-up on my scalp was thick and you could feel the scabs and ridges as you rubbed across my scalp.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a bit slow) on the process of transitioning to baking soda washes and apple cider vinegar rinses.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I have used in the past, I was always scratching my head (and it got worse with the baking soda</li>
            <li> The salon sold me a couple of very expensive products for thinning hair, including a scalp serum to leave on between shampoos, with instructions to shampoo my hair only ONCE PER WEEK if I wanted to save my hair!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has way less cons than the soap nut shampoo in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I tried it without using a conditioner for about two weeks to give my hair time to adjust to it, but it became a ridiculous ordeal just trying to comb through my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> and I have tried for years to find a shampoo that wasn&#x27;t irritating and a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair look dull.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately our hard water (even though it is filtered) didn&#x27;t work well with the usual baking soda + apple cider vinegar combo.</li>
            <li> It is not good for ME.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about this product&#x27;s potential to take care of my hair during the crazy Arizona&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li> Do yourself and your hair/scalp a big favor and try this shampoo because you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more cloying, suffocating stench...  </li>
            <li> While the shampoo does not have sulfates or sulfides, which are a type of industrial frothing agent designed to strip grease, it does have a slightly less dangerous industrial frothing agent, lauryl glucoside, which is still a skin irritant.</li>
            <li> Got thin hair.</li>
            <li> but it was bad and has been that way for the past 18 years, probably longer.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this did NOT work for my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is on the expensive side</li>
            <li> and it is so difficult to find a shampoo for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I finally have a product that&#x27;s not causing terrible dermatitis break-outs on my scalp, neck, around my ears.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but even when I had longish hair (shoulder blades)</li>
            <li> It was also extremely difficult to brush my hair without conditioner, which I try not to use since my hair does tend to get oily</li>
            <li> than others, but not perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of shampoos from expensive salon products to cheapo dollar store products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This might seem expensive for shampoo</li>
            <li> Also it looks like it is soap based because after using it for 2 weeks, I can feel some buildup and weird feeling using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what went wrong</li>
            <li> That might not make much of a difference to some, but I&#x27;ve gotten sick of paying outrageous prices for teeny packages!</li>
            <li> Then once I use all my other stuff up that has the nasty sulfates in it, I will be using this and co-washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up so frustrated with my nasty, dry, dreadlocks I gave up.  </li>
            <li> I used to get a pinkish, itchy rash along the hairline at my neck and forehead that drove me CRAZY, but I saw a noticeable difference after using NaturOli.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it contains no parabens, propylene, butylene glycols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis in spots that drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> poo\\&quot; to reduce exposure to artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> a favor and get over dependence on artificial ingredients in hair care products.</li>
            <li> Panicking and desperate, I bought this shampoo upon the recommendation of my dad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> SO SAD :(</li>
            <li> very expensive too.</li>
            <li> Horrible :-/!</li>
            <li> I am still amazed that my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and isn&#x27;t impossible to comb through, or doesn&#x27;t feel like straw without using conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It leaves moisture and has none of that bad stuff in it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed</li>
            <li> You must give this a shot if you are disappointed in your hair care regime.  </li>
            <li> Very Disappointing!!!!</li>
            <li> gave this three stars because it didn&#x27;t smell terrible and my hair wasn&#x27;t like straw or anything.</li>
            <li> , my hair was terrible hours after it was washed.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s scalp was in terrible</li>
            <li> it was terrible for me.</li>
            <li> I figured the worst that could happen was I ended up with waxy hair.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my hair looked horrible after going without conditioner for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to deal with this horrible hair for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a year now and love it!  My son and daughter are using it (my teenage daughter even requested I buy it again after running out - impressive since kids are often more interested in chasing trends or what ever is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t let the price scare you off - I&#x27;m very cheap (single dad of 6) but this bottle seems to last a long time since you don&#x27;t need to use a  whole lot. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. Not much suds, but thats a good thing. That means no chemicals are in there to make it suds.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and no cancer or thinning hair later on. I mix in a little 100% Pure brand kids shampoo to make it smell fun.</li>
            <li> Very well  packed and arrived on time. very expensive too. I bought two and see now that wasted the money. It is not good for ME. I have very itchy skin after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t return, because I opened one and my wife started using the other one, so both are used a little. Found another organic product which cost 1/4 of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this did NOT work for my hair. Left it dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> I recently grew the hair dye out of my hair and the herbalist who helped me through this process recommended this shampoo. I use only the shampoo: my hair no longer requires a conditioner ( which is the claim on the bottle- and VERY hard for me to believe unless I actually experienced it!). My hair is fuller and SHINY and very healthy looking. My scalp is conditioned too- absolutely no itching or dandruff. I highly recommend this product and order it as soon as the bottle becomes low ( which is not often because a little goes a LONG way)....so that I always have it on hand!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not very sudsy so make sure your hair is drenched in water before you lather it on and do it fast because it&#x27;s like putting a runny gel. For something that doesn&#x27;t require a condition, this product is great! My hair feels softer and cleaner after using this product than any other shampoo+conditioner products! This shampoo is on the expensive side so I use it about every other time--but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was not sure about not needing conditioner as I have long hair and have always put tons of conditioner in my hair to keep it soft. I have to say, after 3 times of washing my hair with this shampoo, I am a believer. I love this shampoo and will continue to use it. A real winner!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and usually my hair does great with sulfate free products.  I was excited to try this.  It was great at first but I noticed after a couple of weeks that my hair was getting dryer with every wash.  Had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This is my now favorite shampoo. I had always bought my shampoos at the salon. And I wasn&#x27;t always happy. A friend told me about this product when I started looking into more natural products. So I ordered it and tried it. I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s super fine and I&#x27;m always trying &amp;#34;volumnizing&amp;#34; products. This shampoo did the trick AND made my hair shiny (which I didn&#x27;t realize until I got to work and people started commenting on it!). I can&#x27;t shampoo everyday due to climate and skin issue so I wash twice and the second lather is always nice and soapy like the first on a regular creepy chemical shampoo. I wish they made a conditioner too!&lt;br /&gt;The price is comparable to what I was paying at the salon but this works better on my hair, is better for my hair, and it seems like it&#x27;s going to last longer! YAY!</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally coarse hair and an oily scalp and I have tried for years to find a shampoo that wasn&#x27;t irritating and a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair look dull. I can&#x27;t say I was blown away by how wonderful and flaxen my hair was after using Extreme Hair because it didn&#x27;t do much to soften it, however it worked wonders for my irritated scalp. I used to get a pinkish, itchy rash along the hairline at my neck and forehead that drove me CRAZY, but I saw a noticeable difference after using NaturOli. My scalp felt very clean, and looked white and healthy. I bought a trial size and got about 4 uses out of it and in that short amount of time it completely calmed my scalp. I was really skeptical of their claim that you &#x27;don&#x27;t need conditioner&#x27; but, to my surprise, it&#x27;s true. My hair was a little hard to comb through wet but I let it dry a little and, once I got through the heavy tangles, my hair was as manageable as if I had used conditioner. I liked it well enough and will probably get more and mix up a little natural conditioner to use with it. If you value green living and don&#x27;t have horrid, unruly hair (like mine) I think this will work very well for you. I also have to add that the shipping is really reasonable. That might not make much of a difference to some, but I&#x27;ve gotten sick of paying outrageous prices for teeny packages!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now. And I can say my oily hair and scalp is well cleansed! Seems to bring out the color of my hair leaving it shiner, tangle-free and better managed. No soapy or waxy residue. I also noticed that this shampoo balances secretion of oil glands very well in my scalp leaving it itch-free and my hair oil/dirt free. Amazingly, NO other conditioners needed. The composition of this shampoo is excellent!  Simply the best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Will buy again. Highly recommended for those of us with normal/oily hair and scalp.  Just a small note: it may take a week or so to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; hair and scalp of common chemical residue and buildup as stated on bottle which is true if you have used other shampoos that contain parabens, propylene, butylene glycols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great. I use it alternately with Acure Organics almond. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointing!!!! It has NO lather, &amp; my hair looks &amp; feels more lifeless than before! Not Recomended at all!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because sometimes natural products don&#x27;t work as well as chemical laden ones. But this shampoo is amazing. I will not go back to the other kind. The test for me was asking my husband &#x27;have you noticed anything different about my hair?&#x27; after a week of use and he said &#x27;Not at all&#x27; SCORE! That is all I wanted. A natural, American made product that works as well as anything else. I will definitely be ordering this shampoo again when I am done with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was packed and shipped fine and the delivery was very quick. Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo daily for over a year.  I&#x27;m delighted with the product because it gently cleans my hair without irritating my scalp.  It leaves my hair feeling very clean and seems to volumize my hair.  I&#x27;m trying to reduce the number of chemicals in my body, so it is nice to have an all natural product that works as described.  Try a bottle.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My hair is so healthy and shiny. I get compliments on it all of the time. Additionally, if you color your hair, it prserves it so you don&#x27;t lose the color.</li>
            <li> I have color treated (streaked blonde) hair that is cotton candy fine.  I also have an oily scalp.  I have only used this shampoo once, but do like it. It got my hair clean with a small quarter size dollop--my hair is in a pixie cut--and lathered up like regular shampoo.  I did not notice a smell other than clean from the shampoo.  I felt that it acted just like regular shampoo you buy with all the petrol chemicals in it--but this doesn&#x27;t have any!!!!!  I will buy it again without a doubt. I may try the shampoo for dry hair and switch back and forth using the two, since my color treated hair tends to dry out--I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I need to do this.  Very good product and my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> This is a truly gentle and well cleansing product.</li>
            <li> My spouse likes it..I have bot more afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different brands of organic shampoo and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Others either left my hair extremely dry or stopped working after a week. This shampoo made my hair feel very healthy and manageable. The only downside is that I go through a bottle a month even if I wash my hair once every 2 days.</li>
            <li> clean and healthy product thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dull dirty-blonde hair.  Wanting to find a good natural shampoo, I tried the NaturOli Normal to Oily.  The first thing I noticed was how silky and shiny my hair was.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple months, and will continue to use it.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it for the purity of the product.  One note: you have to make sure your hair is thoroughly wet before application to get the best sudsing activity (although not necessary for a good cleansing).</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels after using it. The only problem it that I have to use so much to make it really lather on my head.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really is everything everyone says it is. After making the switch to an all natural lifestyle, shampoo was the hardest for me to give up. I tried no poo, coconut milk and dr. bronners but my hair never felt clean. I love knowing that all the ingredients are all natural and there aren&#x27;t preservatives in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Have purchased and tried many shampoos for my son who has very oily hair and seborreah (?). Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps the medical condition, but really takes care of the oily hair.  Thankfully it is also odorless.  The perfumes in all the grooming products, soaps, deodorents, shampoos, one walks around as a stinky perfume bomb.</li>
            <li> Gets build up out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair extremely clean and soft without use of more than a tiny drop of conditioner.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner  every time.  Everybody&#x27;s hair will differ with need for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Your water will determine your need for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend a good shower filter if you expect your hair to be the best it can be.  They screw right on your shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Dec 2014:  I&#x27;ve been through many bottles of this shampoo and will never switch as long as I can get it.  My hairstylist constantly reminds me how amazing my hair looks for my age. (going on 60)  This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  There is absolutely no build up on the hair,  and even though my hair is long I have very little hair that falls out when I shampoo,  when I used to get handfuls with all other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It seems like it is the only natural and chemical free shampoo that I tried that made my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo as I have oily hair and it is so difficult to find a shampoo for oily hair. I have used soap nuts by themselves to wash my hair when I was young and they are very good for your hair. Since I have thinning hair too, I thought this shampoo will be great for my hair. While it cleans my hair very good, I get my hair oily the very next day. I don&#x27;t have this problem with regular shampoos and can go without washing my hair for two days. I am not sure why this shampoo makes my hair oily, it kills the purpose of buying this shampoo. I like the fact that it contains no parabens, propylene, butylene glycols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances. Contains no animal products &amp; not tested on animals. It comes in a big bottle and I don&#x27;t need a lot to wash my hair. If only I could go two days without washing my hair, this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li> This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  I have all 3.  After my hair detoxed I fell in love.  Because this one is so expensive I&#x27;ve tried many others natural and synthetic fragrance free shampoos hoping I can switch to something cheaper but nothing compares.  It&#x27;s expensive but on the plus side, I can go an embarrassingly long time without needing to wash it so it lasts longer than other products.  It took a few weeks for my hair to detox but once it did, Wow!  Commercial shampoos never made my hair look half as good.</li>
            <li> I only buy sulfate free shampoo and found this shampoo when looking for a clarifying shampoo w/out sulfates.  I use this shampoo about once a month to remove all build up of conditioner/hair products and it works (and smells) great!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of \\&quot;Green\\&quot; products on the market - but many of them just don&#x27;t do the job. Yet this one does! I have been using it for just about a month now and can&#x27;t get over how wonderful my laundry comes out. The whites come out white, the colors bright, and even the jeans feel wonderful. I&#x27;ve used practically every brand in the past, from Tide to bargain ones, but none of them did the job as well. I&#x27;ve stopped using fabric softeners and dryer sheets, as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any need for those anymore. The clothes have a wonderful fresh feeling when I take them out of the dryer. They keep their shape without being limp or floppy. Also, there is not any static cling, even with some of the nylons and rayons. I washed about 20 loads so far and the volume of the bottle has hardly gone down. To summon it all up - I love this product and will keep buying it. No more heavy bottles of detergent to lift, which are mostly water anyway, no more fabric softeners, etc. Not only a big saving but also a step in the right direction to help our environment!</li>
            <li> very good I will recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;urOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Gluten Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair - &amp;#34;EXTREME Hair&amp;#34; - Unscented - 16oz. Made with USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC Soap Nuts / Soap Berrie</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best natural shampoo I have tried. I felt like others left my hair feeling dirty/unwashed or way too dry. This one lathers nicely, has essentially no scent, and leaves my hair looking and feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like i need to use just a tiny bit of conditioner though. So I will probably try their normal to dry formula next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably use about two teaspoons each time I wash my hair, but I feel like I am using a little less each time, as all the old residues are washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy, colored hair, for the record.</li>
            <li> For years I have been searching to find a shampoo that keeps the dermatitis flare ups on my scalp at bay. This is it! Other shampoos are full of chemicals and fragrance that just seemed to aggrevate things. I am so glad I finally found a natural product that works and my hair looks healthy, doesn&#x27;t break and is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;For someone having scalp problems or for someone that just wants to use a natural product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have poker straight, medium brown untreated hair. It is on the oily side. I usually go for volumizing shampoos, to give my hair fullness. I have only used this shampoo once. All I can say is, \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;. It was like I had a different head of hair. No kidding. It looked like I colored it. It is so shiny, &amp; full &amp; just beautiful. I cannot use scented products, so I settle for what I can get my hands on. I can&#x27;t imagine ever wanting to use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months so I could be fair with the results. I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of May. I also began using &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time. For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene. I did this for 7 days using both. After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights. Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then. I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time. The build-up on my scalp was thick and you could feel the scabs and ridges as you rubbed across my scalp. I forget the actual medical condition I had but it was bad and has been that way for the past 18 years, probably longer. I have tried every store brand I could get my hands on and started using products found at Trader Joe&#x27;s (Jason&#x27;s, Tea Tree Oil and Citrus Shampoos) all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos. I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue. I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it. So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me. The only itch I have now is sweat from throughout the day, but by the time I wash my scalp at night I finally have relief again. Now if only I can find something to stop me from sweating? &amp;#34;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of. I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap. All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good. My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap. While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little. I cannot wait to try the soap Nuts Soap to see how this works. I hope this review helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of 05/25/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the results are the same. I have not had one flake of dandruff for over a year and not one scab on my head. I still wash the same way. I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s. I love both of these shampoos. I also have finally settled on a good soap too, that does not leave my skin flaky and itchy like all the other soaps I have tried. After trying the Soap Nuts Soap I was not all that impressed for the price. It did work, but no more so than the olive oil soap I have resorted to. So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more. I now use this soap only and it seems to be working quite well with no skin irritation after using the soap. Again, I hope my brief comments are of use to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of 11/15/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched to Carina Organics Pure &amp; Natural Daily Moisturizing Shampoo, Pure &amp; Natural Daily Light Conditioner and Pure &amp; Natural Dandruff Flake Removal Shampoo. I made this decision after carefully reviewing products as found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database found at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse.php?atatime&#x3D;50&amp;category&#x3D;shampoo&amp;order&#x3D;webscore_INC&amp;&amp;showmore&#x3D;products&amp;start&#x3D;0.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets oily fast. I have pretty thick fine (Asian) hair and my roots/bangs area can get oily in a day and will show readily on day 2 if not washed again. So I tried this product for about 4-5 times a week. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. I would rub my scalp thoroughly. There was a less than to a normal amount of foam. I WOULD use some conditioner on the tips of my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t tangle so much. My top area feels pretty coarse and I&#x27;ve been missing the silken feel on all parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this three stars because it didn&#x27;t smell terrible and my hair wasn&#x27;t like straw or anything. I just didn&#x27;t think it helped my situation at all. I would use just this product if it did. I was willing to spend this amount for shampoo every time if it worked because people have been claiming that they have been able to go longer days without washing their hair and suffering the oily roots. Reviewers have even cautioned to resort to having to use it more than 2x a week to see results. I have definitely been doing that and more to no noticeable results at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! No cindutioner necessary! I recommend for those who, like me, find commercial shampoos too harsh.  Only dawback is it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Natural, no harsh chemicals, sulfate-free shampoo.  Made in the USA.  Very pure and cleansing.  One bottle lasts for quite a bit.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Thank you.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever tried. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, with not itchy scalp. I&#x27;ve been through every natural shampoo out there, and this is the best. Even my daughter, who has scoffed at my other shampoos, loves this.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever!!! I&#x27;m sold on it for life. I plan on trying other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I really like it but it is much too expensive... I try to dilute it between two bottles to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several weeks (5-6 weeks) without conditioner. My scalp is still more oily than I hoped but overall improved. I finally have a product that&#x27;s not causing terrible dermatitis break-outs on my scalp, neck, around my ears. My hair is softer, glossier and more manageable. It&#x27;s not breaking as much either, even without conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was drying to my hair. I have thin blonde colored hair and was hoping this would moisturize the ends as it cleansed but it did not. No smell either. I like a little bit of a clean smelling shampoo</li>
            <li> At this moment, I&#x27;m using it when I clean my hair before I henna it. Then once I use all my other stuff up that has the nasty sulfates in it, I will be using this and co-washing my hair. If it does start to not work like it has been then I&#x27;ll be switching up with another sulfate free shampoo. If sulfate free stuff starts to not work then once a month I&#x27;d use a sulfate shampoo to get rid of any build up. I am now washing my hair every other day because it&#x27;s summer. In winter I wash my hair maybe twice a week, depends on whats going on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this shampoo to work, but after 3 months of exclusive use, I have found that it performs no better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s All-in-one soap (which I also do not like for all the same reasons).  For reference - I have a lot of hair, but it is thin, long and obviously oily.  I do not dye or style/blow-dry my hair ever.  I do not wash my hair every day, as I have found that it actually makes my hair even more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All natural&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Left hair with a very greasy feeling, like it just took the oil off your scalp and redistributed it all over your hair&lt;br /&gt;- I definitely lost more hair using this shampoo than the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo or other shampoos&lt;br /&gt;- My scalp was left with a film that would cause it to itch, something that I never experienced with other shampoos&lt;br /&gt;- I tried using less, more, multiple washes, hot or cold rinses - nothing improved the texture of my hair&lt;br /&gt;- Pretty expensive, kind of peeved that I spent all this money and it made my hair worse than before I started using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t matter if I washed every other day, or once every 4 days, my hair was terrible hours after it was washed.  It&#x27;s a weird feeling; my scalp felt almost squeaky clean during the shower, but every evening it would feel greasy again.  As a bonus, I would have this gunk that would get underneath my fingernails if I scratched my head. I kept telling myself I needed time to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; from my old shampoos, but if a product cannot produce results after using it exclusively for months, then it&#x27;s not going to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the no-poo method (i.e. giving up shampoo completely) and I couldn&#x27;t make it for longer than two weeks.  I&#x27;d have to say out of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (clarifying, traditional, natural), the one that does the best job is the Desert Essence Lemon Tea Tree shampoo.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has way less cons than the soap nut shampoo in my opinion.  I&#x27;m still searching for the Holy Grail of natural, oily-hair shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for two weeks now. It leaves my hair in a tangled mess I cannot get a comb through unless I use a lot of conditioner. Will switch back to my regular sulfate-free organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wow, I used this shampoo twice and my scalp is already 95 % better. I have psoriasis in spots that drive me crazy.  I have tried a million shampoos and some might work for most of the day and maybe into the next day some but this.....this is by far different from the rest. My scalp is amazing different! No flakes, no dryness, no itching.  Thank you! I can&#x27;t wait to try other products with soapberries!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I kept seeing the no poo talk everywhere and I am not ready for that. I love this shampoo, I never needed conditioner, after about a week I could feel and see the difference in my hair. I had gotten a really bad perm and they screwed my hair up and my old hair dresser I went crying back to, told me that whatever I was using was helping. It is expensive but even when I had longish hair (shoulder blades) it lasted me quite a while. I can&#x27;t wait to see how this does in winter time in the northeast when my scalp is usually horribly dry</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and no, you don&#x27;t need conditioner. I have bleached platinum blonde hair and this isn&#x27;t over drying. It also didn&#x27;t cause any brassy tones. Use every other day or less. If I have styling products in, I rinse with this shampoo twice, if not, only one rinse will do. :)</li>
            <li> I tried to go \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; to reduce exposure to artificial ingredients. Unfortunately our hard water (even though it is filtered) didn&#x27;t work well with the usual baking soda + apple cider vinegar combo. So, I started looking for a truly natural shampoo. NaturOli to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to using regular shampoo, you will have a bit of a tough time transitioning to NaturOli as it won&#x27;t get all foamy like you&#x27;re used to. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of using more to try to get the same slippery, foamy feel out of this shampoo - you won&#x27;t get it. Just trust that using a normal amount - I use about 2 quarter-size globs for my very long hair - will get the job done. I also re-wet my hair half way through washing to help move the shampoo around to areas I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any conditioner with this shampoo either. I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower and just comb through my hair while it&#x27;s wet. As I mentioned, my hair is quite long and it does tend to tangle. But, I haven&#x27;t had any need for conditioner to detangle since using NaturOli. I use it twice a week and don&#x27;t shampoo the other days. My hair looks great and is as shiny as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your hair (and your wallet) a favor and get over dependence on artificial ingredients in hair care products.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work for me. It left my hair waxy and no matter how hard I tried to scrub my scalp I get having issues with flaking of what appeared to be dandruff.</li>
            <li> this is daughters favorite..doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp..or leave a residue behind</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, because I was starting down the path to rid my life of as many chemicals as possible. I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to everything, from sound, smells, and chemicals, but a recent allergic reaction caused me to start reacting to almost everything in my life, from detergent, to shampoo, to toothpaste. I had to learn how to make everything myself, and it was pretty overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this product might offer me an alternative to making my own shampoo (which had been disappointing and frustrating) and from all the product reviews I was sure that it would be safe for me. While the shampoo does not have sulfates or sulfides, which are a type of industrial frothing agent designed to strip grease, it does have a slightly less dangerous industrial frothing agent, lauryl glucoside, which is still a skin irritant. My skin and scalp (and my husband&#x27;s) were itchy for several days after only one use. I also noticed that waaay more of my hair than normal came out in the wash, which I noticed several other people complained about. I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Alright, well, I wanted to wait until I&#x27;ve used this product a few times before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of a background, I&#x27;ve been using Avalon Organic shampoos for the last 6 months.  But most of the time I felt like I was just pouring soap into my hair, and getting it to lather was next to impossible.  It was also extremely difficult to brush my hair without conditioner, which I try not to use since my hair does tend to get oily pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something different that&#x27;ll do more for my hair than what Avalon was doing, especially since spending $10 on an 8oz bottle was getting incredibly expensive, and I thought this was it.  I was a little nervous to try it since I read some negative reviews, especially the one where a woman said she started losing her hair bec. of this product (!) but I went ahead and ordered it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been three weeks, and so far I don&#x27;t see anything different about my hair than when I was using Avalon shampoos.  With the exception that I&#x27;m able to brush my hair without the use of conditioner (I brush it in the shower, my hair is curly, and I want them to stay XD) there&#x27;s really no difference.  I haven&#x27;t been losing any more hair than normal, but I&#x27;m not seeing all the amazing stuff people have been raving about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess cause I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos for half a year now, there was no &amp;#34;buildup&amp;#34; for this one to clear away.  So...idk.  Pretty disappointed.  I still have most of the bottle, it does lather but it takes a bit of rubbing to get it going, and it doesn&#x27;t build up the same way with regular shampoo, not that I was expecting it to.  It was better than Avalon though, in that regard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars bec. it&#x27;s okay, but not really that much more amazing than any other natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is worth the money. I have long hair that tends to be oily. Taking care of it and keeping it clean is a constant battle for me. I have tried several sulfate-free shampoos and this one is both gentle on my hair and gets it clean without leaving a build up. Perfect for a daily shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product very much, but it is a little expensive. The first bottle will go faster while it detoxes your scalp with multi washes per shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved how little my hair changed when I switched to this product; it works as well as any chemically-laced shampoo, and you can feel safe that your hair isn&#x27;t soaking in cancerous gel ;D</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shining, there is no need to wash them every day as after using this shampoo my hair does not get oily as quickly as before.</li>
            <li> If you want organic and natural..........NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME Hair\\&quot; - Unscented - 16oz. Made with USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC Soap Nuts / Soap Berries!.....They are a good line of products!~</li>
            <li> Hair is shiny and clean after wash, but if conditioner is not used don&#x27;t bother brushing your hair. #ouch</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been everything I hoped. My hair is oily so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do the job. It works well and I haven&#x27;t had to use conditioner since I started using it. My hair always feels squeaky when I get out of the shower, and I&#x27;m always worried it won&#x27;t brush out, but it always brushes out easily, better than when I used conditioner. Glad to have one less step in the shower. My hair, which is fine, also has more volume and body with this shampoo, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I think it&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t a bunch of stuff weighing it down. Some people have commented that this isn&#x27;t fragrance free. While it does have a smell to it, which is very mild and pleasant (and I don&#x27;t smell it on my hair) it is free from Fragrance, which is where many companies hide toxic ingredients. Really happy to be using a shampoo free from all the toxic stuff!</li>
            <li> When I switched to a natural shampoo I wanted something with suds. It makes it so much easier to wash my hair. I didn&#x27;t go through a major &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34; phase and the first bottle was well loved. My hair felt soft and clean (but hard to detangle) and it didn&#x27;t change my shower routine much. My husband loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the second bottle my hair was feeling too dry (even with regular oil treatments) and my scalp was flaking. My husband&#x27;s scalp was in terrible shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching to Morrocco Method&#x27;s shampoo which is working out better long term. I miss suds when I was my hair but I&#x27;m not wanting to sacrifice ingredient quality (a problem in &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos) and I don&#x27;t want to risk a flaky scalp again. If I were to switch to a more bubbly shampoo without sacrificing ingredients and was willing to pay more, I would try Living Libations shampoo. They are a Canadian company. I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this shampoo helped me transition to better shampoo but long term it was terrible for me.</li>
            <li> Buying this magnificent shampoo I finally both got or that needs me.it the first shampoo of  so ideally clears gives a fresh kind to the hair more than 3 days.he froths perfectly, smells.All I very recommend!Now I will be flattered only to them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vegan, it does exactly as it says it does.  I will use no other.  However, beware that you can&#x27;t just go from the &amp;#34;chemically based/animal by-product&amp;#34; shampoos expecting the same result.  You have to allow your hair at least a month to detoxify itself from the residue left from your typical shampoos and conditioners.  When I first began my vegan journey I was shocked to find that my Natural Suave (Coconut) shampoo and conditioner had honey in it and, of course, tested on animals.  I switched to using my toddler&#x27;s shampoo/body soap (vegan) and suffered through what I call &amp;#34;hair withdrawal&amp;#34;.  Talk about a tangled mess, but I wasn&#x27;t going back to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34;.  Then after a month, I found this product, purchased it and can I just say, &amp;#34;wow, amazing!&amp;#34;.  No more tangles, people compliment my hair for it&#x27;s softness, and shine.  The first time I used it I read the instructions, and it does say that if your hair has been subjected to chemically induced shampoos that results may take a week.  It will take a month, but it is well worth it.  Now onto my next vegan venture - hairspray......  Good luck to you and your own journey - your suffering will end and the reward will be for both your hair AND the animals.</li>
            <li> This was my &amp;#34;I think I made a huge mistake&amp;#34; purchase after trying to go &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34;.  I first tried &amp;#34;Silicone/Sulfate&amp;#34; free shampoos and figured why stop there?  That&#x27;s when I dove head first into the process of going without shampoo.  Sounds gross, I know, but bear with me.  I read for months (I&#x27;m a bit slow) on the process of transitioning to baking soda washes and apple cider vinegar rinses.  I figured the worst that could happen was I ended up with waxy hair.  Without softened/filtered water I did, so I switched to soapberries.  No, not this stuff yet, I went and bought a bunch of soapberries and made my own liquid.  Something was up with that and I started loosing a lot of hair.  I freaked out and before trying again with the plain berries and a thicker conditioner, I found NaturOli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, aaaaah suds again!  I missed the suds, they were nice to have back.  Second, aaaah thick shampoo that isn&#x27;t just liquid! I missed the gel consistency as well. I went on my cleansing adventure to find a way to score an extra day of clean looking hair.  This almost gets that for me, almost.  I&#x27;ve be using this for the last six months and my hair is pretty happy.  It stopped falling out (after the plain soapberry liquid) and is nice and shiny.  This shampoo has no particular smell, but that&#x27;s just fine, my hair just smells like...hair.  If I wash my hair in the late morning/early afternoon I can squeak two days of clean looking out of it.  That&#x27;s better than I was doing, which was dirty looking by mid afternoon after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are it&#x27;s a bit expensive (darn you natural stuff) and I still have to use a conditioner with it despite product claims.  I went a couple of weeks without a conditioner when first trying the product and my hair threw a fit.  It gets tangled and a bit dry at the ends.  I do think I&#x27;ll try my soapberry liquid again with a sturdier conditioner, but I&#x27;ll have a bottle of this in my cabinet ready tosave the day if I start loosing hair!</li>
            <li> personally, i have very thick hair and it is definitely very tangled after i wash it.  But i have come to realize if you dont wash the bottom ends of your hair very often (i mean like, once a week maybe) and just massage your scalp with the soap and ABSOLUTELY brush your hair before you shower or else youll be in a world of pain trying to comb it out if you choose not to use a separate conditioner.  If you brush your hair thoroughly before showering then you dont need an additional conditioner but otherwise its pretty rough.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo. This all-natural, organic shampoo has helped reduce hair fall to a great extent !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has oily hair, and she seems to really like the way it works. It really cleans her hair good and helps to keep the oils at a minimum. So far, the best shampoo we have found for oily hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo for those that don&#x27;t want to expose your hair to nasty, harsh chemicals. This shampoo is vegan and gluten free, so it&#x27;s great for those that are worried about allergies. Comes in a nice sleek container, and has a separate cap that seals better for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Will definitely be a repeat customer. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have not washed my hair for 6 days and it still looks clean! It also rinses faster and cleaner than other shampoo</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the super-expensive stuff I used to use - two to three small latherings will do the trick (don&#x27;t do a single big lathering, it won&#x27;t work as well).  It smells nice, no chemical smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave build-up on my hair.  And you really can use it alone, without any conditioner!</li>
            <li> everyone&#x27;s need is different.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t quite hit the spot I needed it to, but still looking.&lt;br /&gt;better than others, but not perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet on this item since I just started using it but it seems to work ok.  I hope so for the money.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from dandruff this past winter.  Nothing I used (including selsun blue and head and shoulders) ever worked.  I still had an itchy flaky scalp.  I tried this and like a miracle it worked!  no more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I have dyed bright red hair. I have been looking for an organic shampoo to help with the color. At first I tried fundamental earth fundamental shampoo (lavender) but it made my hair too dry and extremely knotty. I found this and thought it was a tad pricy. But I gave it a try and am so glad I did. This stuff makes my hair so soft and smells alright too. It leaves moisture and has none of that bad stuff in it. It also helps with the color a lot. Since there is no stripping chemicals in it, it preserves color. Which if you have red hair, you know how hard it is it keep the color. But anyway, this shampoo definitely did it for me. The only downside is it&#x27;s a bit pricy. Which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a good organic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw.  I like the way this shampoo cleans and rinses out.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My son had dry scalp and oily hair. This is the only shampoo that has ever helped. It worked after the first use. Will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> So after I bought the soap nuts for the laundry and facial soap- I figured I may as well plunge into the shampoo also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, thick, long hair and have tried different sulfate free shampoos, organic shampoos and have not liked any of them.  I have to wash my hair daily and by mid day, my hair would feel weighed down and oily again.  I always would resort back to a salon name brand shampoo which has so many toxins in it but would leave my hair feeling soft an not oily- at least till the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this shampoo actually foams.  It made me feel like it was working the first time I used it.  I do not use a lot of hair products.  If I do use hairspray (rare occasions) I will have to wash and rinse through twice.  My hair is as soft and manageble as it is with the salon product.  I can go with out a conditioner but it is a litter harder to brush/comb when wet.  I do use a pepermint conditioner still or a leave in bought from a health food store which is rated 2 on [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my kids (5 and 7).  My daughter has long fine hair.  If I do not use a conditioner on her hair, it is impossible to brush and knotts up easily which happens with any other shampoo.  It is fine when used with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the NaturOli conditioner. My hair is shinier, lighter weight and less likely to tangle. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as all the shampoos with detergents in them, but if you follow the directions it suds up well enough to be able to feel it throughout your hair (and I have a lot of it)! This is the first non-damaging shampoo I&#x27;ve found that I actually LIKE! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best natural solution for oily hair, I have been using Progaine shampoo but I was concerned about the healthy issues for using high alcohol based products. This shampoo is totally natural and works better than the Progaine itself, leave my hair dry as I want. I would like to thanks Amazon for not only being a purchase tool but for become a great platform that really make a better world giving us the opportunity to discover natural products that saves lifes</li>
            <li> Ive been using these products for several months now, and am utterly in love. I have naturally really dry, long, thin hair, but i still chose to purchase the one for normal to oily hair as the alternative leaves my hair feeling oily after drying. This shampoo is well worth it, and you can tell how well it works immediately after your hair dries. No other conditioners, or products are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but not a lot is required. I am in Florida, and always outside partaking in some activity and use about a nickel sized blob about once a day and it keeps my hair clean, dry, and healthy even with all the dirt and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, 10/10 , definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Got thin hair. It gives nice volume, very satisfied with the volume. And, I can feel my scalp can breathe after using this. Before, with other products, I was just feeling that my hair was soft and that&#x27;s all. This feel more than that. And my hair doesn&#x27;t pile up. It gets shape even after using this shampoo. I recommend it highly. I can tell my hair stays healthy with this shampoo. This is my second order I&#x27;ve just made on Amazon. And as long as the product is on the market, I will buy it. Hope Amazon and the manufacturer reads this comment and never curtails on the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of shampoos from expensive salon products to cheapo dollar store products.  Over the past couple years I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different natural shampoos and I&#x27;ve even tried going \\&quot;no &#x27;poo\\&quot;, but this is the first time I have EVER been so happy with a product!  My hair is plentiful but baby fine with no body at all.  I&#x27;ve been using NaturOli for a couple of months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Not only does my hair feel like I just stepped out of an expensive salon, it feels soft and full of body three days later!  It has also done wonders for my constantly itchy scalp.  No matter what I have used in the past, I was always scratching my head (and it got worse with the baking soda no &#x27;poo method), but not any more.  This is an amazing product and I wish I had discovered it earlier.  Do yourself and your hair/scalp a big favor and try this shampoo because you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that its all natural. Hair gets oily pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural shampoo and decided to try this. It works pretty well. The later isn&#x27;t very plentiful, but that&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it to make it overly sudsy. It cleans my hair, doesn&#x27;t really have a (strong) smell and does the job!</li>
            <li> Before switching to NaturOli I could wash my hair in the morning, and my scalp would be oily by lunchtime. This shampoo really does what it says as far as balancing the natural oil secretion in your scalp. I now have no problems just washing my hair every other day. There&#x27;s no build-up and it even smells pretty good, which is not always the case with natural beauty products. I&#x27;m into my second bottle and it has continued to work amazingly for controlling my oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the downside. I absolutely still have to use a conditioner with this shampoo. I tried it without using a conditioner for about two weeks to give my hair time to adjust to it, but it became a ridiculous ordeal just trying to comb through my hair after washing. I have wavy, slightly coarse hair and this shampoo didn&#x27;t do anything to help detangle it. Also, the downside of an oil free scalp is even drier ends. The ends of my hair looked horrible after going without conditioner for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started using my favorite conditioner again, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since then. My hair looks and feels healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, with a combination of sometimes oily scalp and semi-dry ends. After using this in conjunction with my normal conditioner after a week, my hair is oily by the third day, but I guess that&#x27;s expected. If i wash every other day, I have much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp does seem to itch less and there are much less white flakes near my scalp, in comparison (probably because my scalp used to be dry, or because there is a lot of buildup from other hair products). To be clear though, this Soapnut/Soapberry shampoo has not entirely rid my hair of all oil or tiny flakes, so I took one star off. It&#x27;s not bad though, and I actually learned that this is commonly mistaken as dandruff, but in reality, dandruff doesnt flake and is instead larger chunks (usually yellow not white) attached to the scalp. Well, long story short, I haven&#x27;t experienced dandruff like that since, so I suppose (?) this shampoo has prevented dandruff from happening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I definitely recommend this shampoo if you are conscious of the products you use on your hair and body, and know that nothing here will damage your hair. It&#x27;s pretty good for normal or normal-to-oily hair; I always use Sulfate-free products and I do feel that it is much less damaging to my hair (less split ends!), and I&#x27;m happy to have added this one to the tried list. Everyone&#x27;s results will vary depending on their body chemistry, but this shampoo&#x27;s worth a try, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like using soap nuts to clean with and do laundry, so I decided to try this soapberry shampoo since I wanted to get away from all the shampoos and conditioners with harsh chemicals and toxins in them. It certainly cleaned well, almost too well because it left my long, fine hair in so many tangles while trying to rinse it in the shower... I could barely pull my fingers out because it was so tangled! I tried reapplying it to see if that would help; and it slightly did, but was still far too tangled, so I had to grab for the trusty back-up, Pantene Conditioner to help de-knot my hair. &amp;#60;gulp&amp;#62; I used it several more times, but I always have to have some good conditioner to apply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the bright idea to try this shampoo on the dogs (one of them having longer hair, about 2-3&amp;#34; long strands), and it worked even better on them! The one with the longer hair got little tangles in his hair, too, just like I did, but luckily his hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as mine because it wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as mine. Anyway, if I can find a SUPER conditioner that is non-toxic, I may keep using this shampoo on a regular basis. :) I do like how clean it gets my hair, though, so I will probably continue buying it, but only for an every now and then shampoo. :)</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet if I like it, takes some getting used to a natural shampoo but it is what was advertised and  the company was fast with great service, well packed ..</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this shampoo, due to all the rave reviews. However, I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now and there are many things I don&#x27;t like. My major complaint is that my hair is that by the end of the day, my hair is already getting greasy and my scalp is dirty feeling. My hair is very greasy and dirty feeling by the next morning. At the price I paid, I would have liked to go at least a day without my hair turning oily, especially because it states this shampoo is for normal/oily hair. Also, this leaves my hair frizzy, dry and prone to static. I am also upset that I can not return this item, so I really wasted $20.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair and softens it without chemical buildup, the best all natural shampoo, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because of no SLS!  However, if you do color your hair, you might want to add a conditioner as well.  It lathers great even with the SLS and my hair feels clean.  I will keep buying this but will also look for a conditioner for occasional with it.</li>
            <li> i like this shampoo and appreciate that it is gluten free!! my hair feels nice and clean after each wash. but i must say i feel like it tangles my hair, which would be the first time in my life..</li>
            <li> not of high quality, it is very thick and gelatinous, like jello, it takes about double to three times as much product as other shampoos I have used, just to get my hair soapy and clean feeling. also it strips too much oil off my hair. I will not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it.... sulfate free is the way to go when you have dry curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been washing my hair less (every three days or so) for the past year and this is the only natural shampoo that consistently works for me.  It doesn&#x27;t lather much when you first put it on, but if you rinse and repeat it works much better.  I also follow up with a vinegar rinse due to our hard water.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive, but definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this shampoo, I was literally starting to bald from losing so much hair (for reference, I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s). Panicking and desperate, I bought this shampoo upon the recommendation of my dad. He said it helped his hair balding problems. After using it for just 2-3 weeks, there was a noticeable difference. The volume of my hair increased and it looked a lot fuller. I also felt like my hair felt lighter and cleaner after each wash. I only wash every other day because miraculously it helps keep my grease down.</li>
            <li> I think it is a very good shampoo and i think the price is also very fair.</li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair and I wash my hair and beard every day. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but compliments for this shampoo. The first days were a bit weird, since it would make my hair &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; together while I was washing it (although it went away as soon as I got dry) but this feeling disappeared after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap. With this shampoo however I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m covered with a film of soap/chemical residue afterwards: everything just goes away with the water. And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo. What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive scalp that most shampoos cause to break out and itch, this shampoo seems to minimize problems. i have repurchased several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a natural shampoo without sulfates and this product is very nice.  It lathers well and leaves my hair and scalp clean without being dried out.  It is a little pricey, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again, but I&#x27;m glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of Soapberry shampoo, as it leaves my hair lustrous and thick.  I am 74 years old, and do not want to become bald.  this product has cleared out all the chemicals from my hair with has been mistreated with every hair color under the sun since I was 15 years old.  You don&#x27;t need much of the shampoo, so don&#x27;t try to work up a big lather, as that is not needed to clean the hair.</li>
            <li> There is a great great diference between your regular shampoo no matter its brand... you will notice right away that your hair and scalp are really and simply clean... it is odorless so your hair smells just like clean hair... if you are loosing hair, you can be sure that by your third or fourth wash it will stop falling... this is something else !!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and clean feeling.  I previously had to use a smoothing/straightening conditioner and plaster my hair down with styling products to keep it in place.  Since using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t needed to use a conditioner, and very little styling products because my hair now lays in place beautifully.  Definitely worth the cost, as I have either eliminated or cut way back on all of the other styling products.</li>
            <li> Did not resolve my itchy scalp problem.  Left my hair overly fluffy.  It states you don&#x27;t need conditioner or other products....not.  So disappointed</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever found for my hair (thin, fine and oily). My hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy ever.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast service. Very satisfied!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this shampoo, I was experiencing hair loss at a dramatic rate.  Whether due to stress, getting older, weather - whatever the reason, hair was coming out in the shower and combing out my long hair resulted in clumps.  Having heard a lot about the side effects of SLS, I decided to start trying organic.  The first week of use, I was a little iffy.  My hair would come out of the shower in a tangle of knots that took quite a bit to undo.  My hair felt very course straight out of the shower.  I was not using conditioner at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a week, although my hair still felt course while wet, the tangles became extremely easy to get rid of and my hair started becoming very soft.  I have gotten a bunch of compliments on how healthy my long dark hair looks and better than anything else, unbelievably, the amount of hair I was losing every day has come to almost a complete stop.  The strands I find on my comb amount to what would probably be considered normal, maybe even less.  No more finding hair following out in the shower either.  Although typical conditioners helped tame the frizz, all I use now is a bit of Moroccan Argan Oil and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might seem expensive for shampoo but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t lather but I haven&#x27;t experienced that problem.  So far, it has lathered up quite well and rinsed out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that any shampoo could make that much of a difference in a matter of one week but I was becoming very worried about the loss I was seeing and this shampoo has made me think that it is something that can be corrected. I&#x27;ve used this for almost a month now and I plan on continuing to do so.  Well worth a try in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This review might be a little premature, but I&#x27;ll update as time passes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the product and thanks to Prime, received VERY quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was packaged nicely. Included a sheet with some info on the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is very fine, but I have a lot of it. My biggest issues with my hair is how oily it gets, how dull it looks without product, and how much I shed. I shed ALOT. And I can&#x27;t go more than 24 hours without washing without looking noticeably greasy. My hair almost get clumpy by day too, without a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO my expectations of this product are less oil, more health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first wash, I did one rinse and light shampoo, followed by one heavy lather and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t lather quite like most shampoos we&#x27;re used to; however, I found that watering it down in your hands really brings out the sudsiness. It went through my hair pretty well with a good scalp massage, and washed out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;As the directions suggest, I did not use conditioner- which I can never get away without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the shower, your hair seems tangled and unmanageable. You can&#x27;t really run your fingers through it. So I went ahead and did a light combing and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers, once my hair was dry it felt soft. It&#x27;s crazy. The texture and softness of my hair is very similar to how it used to be before I started coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I styled my hair and it looked nice and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to see how the oiliness factor played, and am currently on day three without a washing. My hair is slightly oily, BUT, not noticeably. SO yeah, this stuff is great so far.</li>
            <li> The woman who cuts my hair noticed a change immediately as to benefits of this shampoo.  Once you get used to no suds you will notice shine, softness, stays clean longer between shampoos because you are not putting grease in hair.  Color of hair stays truer because surfactants don&#x27;t strip color away!  Lasts longer than traditional shampoos (like 6 months)!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I use the normal to oily formula, and it&#x27;s amazing. I have extremely oily hair; with all other shampoos (even sulfate and gluten free shampoos), my hair is always oily by the end of the day. This is the only shampoo that keeps my hair from looking horribly greasy for more than a day, and it only starts to get oily after two or three days. This shampoo has been a life saver, and I don&#x27;t think anything else has ever made my hair feel softer, or look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: Super duper great shampoo, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend for people with oily hair!</li>
            <li> Love! Didn&#x27;t even need conditioner with this shampoo. My hair is long and I either get gloss or sometimes, highlights.</li>
            <li> Switched from a semi-natural shampoo that I used every other day to this. First week was tangly and dry but it improved after that. The shampooing experience isn&#x27;t quite as fun bc although it lathers it&#x27;s hard to get it all through your hair. After the shower it seems tangly and dry but once it has dried a bit you can comb it and it&#x27;s soft and shiny when dry. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks now and I was hoping this product would help solve or reduce my hair loss but unfortunately I am still losing much hair as before with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;So my search continues.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to avoid chemical products for your skin and hair, this is for you.  My family purchased this product when we bought a cabin near a sensitive eco-system.  Only toilet water drained into our septic tank.  All other gray water ran out near our pond.  I carefully researched products that would be environmentally safe for water that could possibly reach our pond and thus the fish that we might eat.  Back to the product--  I liked it so much that I now buy it for use at home.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;And good for your hair, i am happy to have found this.&lt;br /&gt;If only it were little cheaper!!</li>
            <li> It smells alright and spreads well through the hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of almost everyday use, I started having A LOT of dandruff... It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling smooth after you wash off the shampoo, it actually feels the opposite. Also, the shampoo leaves the hair feeling dry and definitely NOT TRUE that you don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner after. For the price, this product is an absolute ripoff. I&#x27;m sticking with the RenPure Keratin combo that&#x27;s been working for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say it has made a huge difference to my hair, but considering it is all natural with none of the nasty things some shampoos contain, it does a great job.  I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. I like the product. I searched for a shampoo wo chemicals not works great. Do not need a conditioner. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for a week, my hair becomes incredibly soft and easy to manage, not to mention the volumizing effect. My housemates (all guys who normally don&#x27;t pay attention to this sort of thing) compliment my hair and want to try this out. I have psoriasis so my scalp can get flaky, sometimes half a day after shampooing. But it&#x27;s not the case with this shampoo. I can go 3 days without feeling itchy and my scalp only becomes flaky after 2 days. The amount of flakes is greatly reduced too. I don&#x27;t think this can cure my psoriasis (if it is the case, the manufacturer must have struck a gold mine), but I appreciate that it helps with the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product is quite pricy, it is thick and you only need to use a bit at a time. I let the product sit in my hair for 5 mins before rinsing out (in hope that my hair can absorb all the nutrients from the shampoo&#x27;s natural ingredients). I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not absolutely in love with it and it is a bit pricey. I guess it just depends on the persons hair, I don&#x27;t know. Shipping and handling was super fast ... happy customer here.</li>
            <li> I have normal-to-dry, color-treated hair.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  After shampooing, my hair feels so clean, silky, shiny ... and beautiful.  My husband even noticed.  You don&#x27;t need a conditioner after using the product.</li>
            <li> We appreciate the low suds!  So natural and lovely results!</li>
            <li> I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product. It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love. It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Why bother?  This shampoo is no better than any that you can buy at the grocery store. Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> Give this product a couple weeks to start working as it will long term.  If you miss a foamy or sudsy feeling, wash a second time with just a small bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It tangles my hair too much. Feels like a regular shampoo. it feels like its stripping the oils out of my hair. Probably not, just how it feels. Wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for 1st couple of months but hair felt coated and heavy after that.  I have very fine hair, not coarse at all so maybe that&#x27;s why.  Also my head began to itch.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a bit on the drying side. I have oily scalp with normal hair. Also I saw a lot of hairfall with this shampoo and I have been using it for 2 weeks. I ordered the sample sizes of this one and the one for normal to dry hair from naturOli web-site. This one is a bit harsher than the other. It dried out my hair and made it hard to comb through. Also it looks like it is soap based because after using it for 2 weeks, I can feel some buildup and weird feeling using this. Will skip this one. I am glad it worked for some people. It did help with the itchiness of the scalp though.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked quite well in my hair. I wish it worked up into a better lather, but it does leave my hair really clean every time and I also deal with less frizz than I did before, even without any conditioner! It would be nice if it had a scent but I love that I&#x27;m not dumping toxins into my scalp when I wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s a little overpriced considering the size of the bottle, but for an organic option I guess you can expect some extra expense.</li>
            <li> Like this shampoo, makes my hair nice, rinses out well, I have a problem with dry ends but it is resolved with this shampoo</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels even without conditioner I always used conditioner because of fly away hair, that&#x27;s been solved with this product.  Thanks NaturOli</li>
            <li> Have to say, that I really love this. This shampoo is my first experience with soap nut &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34;. It leaves my hair very, very shiny and soft. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, as it was a bit difficult to run a comb through my long hair when it was wet. Once it dried a bit, it was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the suds are soft and gentle, and not like one would expect from a shampoo, but it cleaned my hair &amp;#34;squeaky-clean&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use conditioner, but once my hair was dry, I put a dab of Christina Moss&#x27;s conditioner in my palm, rubbed my hands together, and ran them through my hair. Then, my hair was easy to brush and comb, and stays nice for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say that I am very please with this sulfate and dimethicone-free shampoo is an understatement.</li>
            <li> The original natural shampoo from from plants.&lt;br /&gt;I love the clean. Best Ever!</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my hair feel soft, smooth, and clean. I wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is really a great shampoo! I try to use only organic, natural based products. My hair is naturally curly and unruly ;) but this shampoo does a good job on it. I usually ALWAYS have to use a conditioner or else my hair will feel like straw after washing it. BUT, using this shampoo I do not have to condition!!! I was amazed! It makes my hair feel very soft and is more manageable. I love it! Will definately be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> The shampoo definitely cleans well, but I need conditioner to detangle my longer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I only get my haircut every 2-3 months, so I was curious to see if my hairdresser would notice a difference.  As soon as she started to wash my hair, she commented that I must have washed my hair that morning.  It had actually been a couple of days since I had washed it.  She said that it felt healthier, like the shampoo stripped all the damaging stuff off my hair.  I can tell that when I brush my wet hair after getting out of the shower, the brush goes straight through it...where before it would be tangled. I also used to put mousse on my hair to give it more body.  I don&#x27;t need to use the mousse anymore. I do have to use more shampoo than I&#x27;d like to get it to lather like I want.  I just can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m getting all of my hair clean if it isn&#x27;t lathered.  Other than that, I&#x27;m very please with it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I adore this shampoo. I bought it because I was looking for a healthful, non-toxic shampoo. Most other shampoos still contain harsh detergents that damage your hair, even though they claim to be organic and all natural. I personally despise the product marketing. The label isn&#x27;t beautiful, and the original cap that they include isn&#x27;t the useful flip top. The flip top is included though, although it just fell out of my package. It came packed up in a lot of cushioning, which I liked.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, and has no particular scent. I added lots of peppermint essential oil along with tea tree essential oil, to promote scalp health. I think that plus the general goodness of the shampoo is helping my hair growth, as my hair is shinier, a bit stronger, and has no dandruff. I enjoy this shampoo, and plan on using up the entire bottle, as I really like it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from chemicals in my beauty care products, and so began looking for things which claimed to be natural or organic. I found it odd that the ingredient lists on these so-called natural products continued to be unnecessarily long with ingredients I didn&#x27;t recognize, or couldn&#x27;t pronounce. Well, it turns out that these products were not natural after all...they were just chasing what they would likely consider a trend to be natural. Then they label it as such in hopes of selling a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I certainly don&#x27;t consider wanting real and natural products a trend. I&#x27;m tired of slathering on the these lab concoctions they call natural. So I then turned to Castile soap as a body wash, shampoo, etc. I liked the Castile soap, but it left my hair feeling somewhat heavy, perhaps from the glycerin. My fine hair didn&#x27;t like that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had ordered this (the most REAL natural shampoo I could find), and tried it out right away. My hair did not need a conditioner, was light and soft, and still felt that way they next day! NO other shampoo has ever made my hair feel this great. I am amazed, and to me, this is proof that science can&#x27;t outdo nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t consider myself as having oily hair, but because my hair was fine, I chose the normal to oily variation of this shampoo. I noticed the ingredients in both formulations are identical except for one ingredient. The normal to dry variation has guar gum, which I assume is used to protect dry hair.</li>
            <li> I hate writing a poor review on a good product, but I take serious issues with the price! For that reason alone, I give it two stars because of the price gouge. I did enjoy the shampoo but could not justify the price when contemplating reordering.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, but leaves my hair very dry, and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I had been trying various \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; methods for 10 months before trying this shampoo.  We live in Germany and have VERY hard water so finding something that doesn&#x27;t leave hard water residue in my hair has been very challenging.  Baking soda and vinegar left my hair dry and waxy, honey didn&#x27;t remove the oil, egg works great but you can only use it a couple times a month.  Soap nuts worked but take some pre-planning and I wanted something fool proof for days when my hair has to look good.  I have baby fine hair so any kind of oil or build-up on my hair shows immediately.  This shampoo leaves my hair clean and full of body and there is no need for conditioner.  Yes, this stuff is pricey but I use much less of it than I did conventional shampoo and conditioner, and I only need to use it twice a week, as opposed to daily with the old stuff.  With that taken into consideration I spend less just using this one product.  My hair used to get greasy by the next morning when I washed my hair, now I can go 3-4 days before it looks greasy.  This shampoo does not lather up like a normal shampoo but is very effective in removing oil without over drying out your scalp.  I am still amazed that my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and isn&#x27;t impossible to comb through, or doesn&#x27;t feel like straw without using conditioner.  If you would like to rid your hair care routine of the harmful chemicals used in most products and still have great looking hair give this a try, I hope you like it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Some people have complained about tangled hair.  I have a spray bottle of 75% water and 25% apple cider vinegar I keep in the shower and I spray my hair with it after washing.  I let it sit a few minutes and quickly rinse with cool water.  This really helps with static, tangles, and hard water residue (if you have hard water like we do!).</li>
            <li> I have used them all!  From WEN to Alterna and all in between and this is the one! You also must buy &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34; here on amazon to use with this product.  It will astound you.  Also, you MUST get the serum that goes with the shampoo instead of conditioner.  You can get it at Naturoli.com.  It&#x27;s reasonable and lasts a long time.  You must give this a shot if you are disappointed in your hair care regime.  I love this and will be a life-long devotee!</li>
            <li> I was leery of this at first knowing it was sulfate free thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be sudsy, and may not get the kind of clean that I&#x27;m used to PLUS keep the dandruff out.  I was Pleasantly surprised, and Love this shampoo!  The price tag is too steep, but the good thing is you really do not need to use much to get a good wash.  Have tried only two other shampoos to see if any compare to this in quality but that are less expensive, and so far one other is a close tie with this in terms of quality, but still may buy this again.</li>
            <li> not too wild about his shampoo. feels like it&#x27;s drying my hair a little bit and I have to use a lot of it on my curly hair....</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally oily long hair. My hair, on its own volition, goes from curly to wavy to straight. I don&#x27;t use any products, and let my hair air dry. I was no shampoo method for over a year. In that time, my hair got stonger and did a full detox, but over time it never stopped being oily.&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to most skin and hair products. They make my hair fall out in clumps.&lt;br /&gt; Aftermuch debate, I decided to use Naturoli for normal to oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo gets rid of the oiliness, but my hair now gets extremely frizzy and breaks more easily (possibly because Naturoli does such a thorough job of getting rid of all oil). My hair became extremely soft and whispy, but now some strands stick straight up. The good news is that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Lter, I added a sulfate free conditioner to my hair care routine. The whispy flyaways and easy breakage went away. With a sulfate free conditioner, Naturoli shampoo works wonderfully for my needs. :-)&lt;br /&gt;I only need to wash my hair once every two to three days, and am guessing my bottle of shampoo will last me about 2 months.</li>
            <li> just as what is described.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that cleans my hair without the torment of an itchy scalp. The rest of the family uses it now too. We all love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed red, so I try to wash it as least often as possible and use natural products only. I bought this in hopes that it was like my previous natural shampoo I couldn&#x27;t find again.&lt;br /&gt;This left my hair so oily and greasy that I had to wash my hair within 24 hours! I usually wash my hair every other day! My hair has never been greasy or oily before, with any product. I ended up throwing half the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month, and I gotta say that It&#x27;s been great so far. I really feel like my hair and scalp become very clean after using it. It also really helps in protecting my hair from dryness. Since I was looking for something completely organic and natural, this fit the bill. If it makes any difference, I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo. Really moisturizes dry ends without making the scalp oily. Didn&#x27;t have to go through a detox phase because i always use natural hair products. One of my favorites. Only downside no scent after washing. However. i compensate that later with my nubian heritage hair mousse, amazing scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the review. I was at the beginning quite happy with the result. But I had to stop using it very quickly because it was hurting a lot my scalp during all the day.</li>
            <li> Soap nut shampoo is your answer to \\&quot;whats that?\\&quot; when looking at mainsteam shampoo ingredient lists. If you can&#x27;t pronounce it then you should not be rubbing it into your head, all up in your scalp, and all over your body.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, cleaning shampoo for someone with normal to oily hair who has to shampoo every day.  It washes out well and doesn&#x27;t build up.  Soap nuts are good for laundry, too, and apparently work well for shampoos.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Aunt Deve who&#x27;s scalp was so dry and itchy.She was always scaratching her head...  At her age the oil glands are worn out and skin and scalp surface are dry/ thinning. The sodium laurel sulfate and other chemicals in the liquid form of soaps are not helping her condition at ALL.  Most of us in America need to get smart and stop letting the media/corporate cheats that sell cheap chemicals to us for a huge profits and tell us what is acceptable and healthy for us, while in fact are selling us poisonous chemicals. Needless to say that my sweet Angel of a Aunt has no more dry itching scalp and skin problems. Thanks again Nature. I used this Great Sulfate free shampoo as a healthier base and added my essential oils to it to heal and naturally renew my Aunt Deve&#x27;s scalp,skin, and quality of life back to normal. Thanks again Amazon prime! You MADE IT ALL EASY AND AFFORDABLE.[[ASIN:B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nut / Soapberry Shampoo 16oz Organic Natural Hair Care. Sulfate Free! Normal to Dry.

            <li> My hair is \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot;. The shampoo is recommended for normal to oily hair. I have been using it for about a month now. And?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more itching scalp after harsh chemicals. No more irritated skin. No more overwashed hair, that turns oily after couple of days. I thought I always had problem with oily hair. Now it turned out, it wasn&#x27;t the hair. It was all those \\&quot;for oily hair\\&quot; shampoos that I was using. This shampoo gently cleanses the scalp, by removing EXCESS oil from it, and from the hair. Therefore the oil glands in the skin do not kick into overdrive to replace missing oil. It does not irritate my scalp. The sporadic dandruff that I had, is totally gone. The shampoo has a pleasant, subtle scent, that does not stick to my hair. No more cloying, suffocating stench...  And, since my hair does not get greasy, the dust etc. does not stick to it as much. Thus, less frequent washing required. Just like the nature intended. Other shampoos give you healthy LOOKING hair. This one gives you healthy hair and healthy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job exceedingly well, with only one wash. I do not have to \\&quot;rinse and repeat\\&quot;. It leaves my hair clean, fresh smelling, and manageable without conditioner. First time in my life. Wow!</li>
            <li> Love the purity. Hair stays cleaner and fuller longer. Will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I have always has very oily skin and hair. I can wash my hair at night and wake up in the morning and it needs to be washed again. I have been using Wen by Chaz Dean for like 6 months I like the fact that it is an all in one so it saves time and my hair does seem healthier but it makes my hair even oiler and ways it down after a couple of hours. So I got this soap nut shampoo and I am blown away. I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner for the first time ever and my hair actually still has bounce the next day. It has no smell what so ever but I am totally fine with that. It does lather a little so it helps to get it through your hair. But this is my new shampoo even my husband loves it and he usually just uses bar soap.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s gets my hair clean and has literally no &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in the ingredients. it did take about a week for my hair to adapt to the shampoo as noted in the instructions, but I highly recommend this product and will be ordering the laundry and kitchen products as well! Finally, a company with an honest ingredient list that actually works and lives up to its advertising!</li>
            <li> I have been converted! I love the amount of great things that soap berries can do. This is fantastic shampoo and the only one I have every found to make my hair look and feel amazing! I also use Greenwill SoapBerries around the house for all kinds of other reasons. Look into it, soap berries from Greenwill are amazing and the whole reason I got into the Soap berry in the first place.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell really good, and they claimed I would not need conditioner.  Well, I definitely still need conditioner.  But I like the product, because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff that we really don&#x27;t need in it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She normally washes her hair every other day. With this shampoo she has to wash it every day. It has caused her to get dandruff. It doesn&#x27;t leave her hair tangle-free. In fact, it leaves her her a little bit harder to comb. This product sounds great, but the only thing &amp;#34;EXTREME&amp;#34; about it is the extreme price tag. If you&#x27;re looking for a sulfate-free shampoo, you&#x27;ve found one. Buyer beware: it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your hair and it does not leave it oily either.  It is perfect.  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner with it (but I also do not dye my hair at all)</li>
            <li> Actually I really like this, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 9 months and the longer I use it the better it seems to get. My hair gets softer and grooms better and I don&#x27;t have the sores and itching I had with the over counter grocery story bought nuclear waste or what ever they put in that other stuff. It&#x27;s a little spendy but this is the way I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp get bumps on it!  Other shampoos regularly after a few washes (or less) get pimple like bumps on the scalp especially on the back of my neck when it apparently doesn&#x27;t wash out well or something.  I sometimes have to use the product twice - wash - rinse - repeat but it leaves my hair squeaky clean and I don&#x27;t usually have to wash it for another day.  I have a dry scalp but the hair tends to get oily (can&#x27;t figure it out).  I have short hair and it feels clean, slightly textured, and soft.  I am so happy that I&#x27;ve used this same shampoo since I purchased it and haven&#x27;t had to switch!</li>
            <li> I am now in love with my hair  :) I have very oily hair and for the first two weeks it seem as if the shampoo was making it worse. I decided to stick with it and give it more time, and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I live in a place with a very dry climate (Arizona) so when I moved here, I started buying  lots hair products to \\&quot;help my hair survive this climate\\&quot; (sun hair spray protector, living conditioners,  voluminizers of all kind, root boosters, etc) ..Although they did helped to make my hair look decent, every time I had to do my hair, it worried me how many toxic chemicals i was putting in my scalp. ..I knew there had to be something better out there (products that were environmentally friendly and with natural ingredients). That&#x27;s when i did my research through the Environmental Working Group and found this shampoo and I&#x27;m very happy I did. My hair now is very healthy, I don&#x27;t use anything else but this shampoo. Even though is summer and I was skeptical about this product&#x27;s potential to take care of my hair during the crazy Arizona&#x27;s summer. My hair  has never felt better. It&#x27;s shiny, has lots of volume (which has always been my #1 priority), and stays hydrated plus (no splint ends so far) and no more oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;P.s I do have to apply the shampoo twice when I wash my hair. This is because the first time it doesn&#x27;t latter much for me, however the second time, It lathers nicely.--Also, my hair gets very tangled, and at first I was inclined to buy another organic and natural detangler, but decided not to, I just learned to be patient and gentle with my hair. It works wonders. I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE! My hair has never felt so nice from using this shampoo. I do need to use s conditioner still with it but even with using it my hair could have never felt better. Its so pretty and smooth and soft. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I do find myself needing to use a bit of it since my hair is so long. Or I wish they could make bigger bottles :) but I cycle through 3 different shampoos and this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is exactly the kind of shampoo I was looking for. Something that would not just remove the oil and dirt from my hair, but be good for the hair and scalp. I have been using this product for over 6-8 months and will continue to use it for what it provides. Thanks</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the winner.  I have tried several organic, sulfate free, low chemical shampoos and they all left my hair clumpy and oily.  Not the case with NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo normal to oily hair.  My hair looks great... without all those chemicals and perfumes.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this product does as advertised. I use it daily and I have normal to oily fine hair. Applying a medium to small amount into my hair, lather, and rinsing, the shampoo leaves my hair soft and not overly dried-out like some shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With oil managing ingredients, my hair does not get oily as the day winds down, nor right after shampooing with some shampoos. IF you are looking for an organic solution to your shampooing routine I highly recommend this product. Give time to adjust to it. Then you will love it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this Shampoo for a year now and it cuts the oiliness in my hair so well that I only have to wash it every 3 days. I do alternate with another shampoo, but am impressed at how well this sulfate-free soap nut shampoo does!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use this shampoo. We like it much better than the chemical washes we used in the past. I may look at some of this company&#x27;s other products as well. We are trying to stay away from chemicals, there&#x27;s too much of that going on. At least this is a natural soap, although arguably a chemical, this is the natural way to go. We also use coconut none scented soap and are in process of changing our underarm deodorant to be natural. Good luck a keep chems our of your life as much as possible, we are being bombarded by them.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best i have ever tried. My hair is smooth and shiny. It takes two or three times to soap the hair to remove filth due to organic ingredients and a lot of oil extracts in shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well with soft water. I used it for over a week with really good results, but then we had a water filter installed (we had REALLY hard water). After the filter was installed, my hair started getting greasier and greasier (I have really fine hair, so any grease shows up). I started having to shower every day (normally I shower every other day), but it wasn&#x27;t helping... I&#x27;d shower at night, and wake up with greasy hair. I tried using less shampoo, because some websites said that soft water doesn&#x27;t rinse as well, and I tried using MORE shampoo... I even tried an apple cider vinegar rinse... the only thing that got my hair back to being clean and shiny was to go out and buy a regular Herbal Essences shampoo. Probably if we hadn&#x27;t have gotten a water filter, it would have been alright, but it just wasn&#x27;t working for me after the fact. My husband has short, wavy hair, and he hasn&#x27;t noticed any difference, though. It might be alright if you have really short hair. And this was not any sort of detox scenario... I use zero products on my hair aside from shampoo, and my hair had been fine for a week. I also tolerated the grease for long enough to see whether or not it was going to improve on its own.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is truly sulfate free, alcohol free and safe to use for people who are allergic to so many things that are put into shampoos today.</li>
            <li> I am a &#x27;natural&#x27; girl when it comes to products. I don&#x27;t dye my hair or over style it or even blow dry it much. I have been using this amazing product for about a year now... I will never ever ever go back.  This is AMAZING.  Lets just say this: When I got my hair cut last, the hair salon stylist was AMAZED at how healthy and soft my hair was. She couldn&#x27;t stop commenting on it and about five different people felt my hair that day (hahaha).  My hair is not radiant or naturally beautiful, it is just something that the majority of women&#x27;s hair is not: Healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this for about two days and had to use &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo. I wanted to die. After using this product for so long, I noticed an immediate difference when washing my hair. I actually &#x27;felt&#x27; how much the &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo was stripping from my hair. It felt DRY while I was washing it. I immediately used a conditioner after that, in hopes to counter the drying effects of the normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, you do not need a conditioner. I repeat: YOU DO NOT NEED A CONDITIONER. Become skillful at how you wash your hair in the shower, and you won&#x27;t end up with lots of tangles either (if you are use to using a conditioner for this purpose, you will need to relearn how to wash your hair properly so you don&#x27;t knot it up).</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos - some of which should not even be in that category. I really love this shampoo! It&#x27;s gentle enough to use with my babies and the light scent is perfect - even for someone who typically looks for products without any essential oils. I&#x27;m excited to try some of NaturOli&#x27;s other products and highly recommend this one. Just remember that it can take at least 2 weeks for your hair to transition from any other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; - or especially unnatural shampoo. Also, definitely no conditioner needed - just as w/ any truly natural shampoo, let your hair dry before brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gluten free and have problems with other &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34;. This stuff cleans y hair at a  good price and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left a bizarre film on my hair and made my head and face feel very strange.  I have been using organic and natural shampoo for years and have never experienced anything like this.  Just prior to trying the Soap Nut shampoo, I was using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s unscented soap to shampoo with.  I will not use this again.</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff a good college try.  I am allergic to what seems every shampoo/conditioner I try.  It started with redken about 2 yrs ago and its been purology, bed head, and anything in between.  I was hopeful that this would cure it.  I found that it also made me itch and I couldn&#x27;t get a pick through my hair. I ended up so frustrated with my nasty, dry, dreadlocks I gave up.  I cant believe I spent money on this.  SO SAD :(</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural shampoo for my prepubescent daughter. It takes care of the smelling oil and keeps it very shiny.  Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made and I&#x27;m a real cheapskate but this is so worth the price. Hair looks wonderful and I save money by being very sparing with it. I save the old empty bottle and then dilute the shampoo - that helps it last. It is so good to know I am not using detergents on my hair or body anymore. My blonde hair used to always get frizzy and damaged at the ends. I&#x27;ve been using this product like you would &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; - just small amounts, gently massaging into the scalp. No more mussing up the hair in a big lather - I keep the ends down at the bottom so it gets less tangled and less need for any conditioner. Sometimes I do still use conditioner but only a tiny amount that I don&#x27;t rinse out. I seem to get about 2-3 months out of 1 bottle by only washing my hair twice a week.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works for me. after trying several shampoo&#x27;s, i switched to organic soap nuts shampoo, and my hair fall has reduced to some extent. and my hair is manageble, i do smell some soapnuts and also feel slight dandruff, but overall it helped my hair fall problem, so i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo,natural and cleans great with out leaving heavy hair.great smell</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products for my oily hair, but nothing worked as much as NaturOli did.&lt;br /&gt;Great feeling to use an all natural product and also have some terrific results.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars product with 5 stars service.  Shipment is super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have super thin, baby-fine hair that needs a ton of products just to get it to look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there that promises to thicken and volumize but nothing has ever really ever worked leaving me with too many embarrassing &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; to count. I&#x27;ve always used expensive yet gentle shampoos so I never stopped taking care of my hair nor have I ever abused it. And back when it was in style, I would perm my hair to get volume, but I haven&#x27;t done that for about 12 years so I&#x27;ve had to deal with this horrible hair for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute last straw was at my most recent salon visit when I was told my hair is thinning - a LOT. I know thinning of the hair happens as we get older, but I just don&#x27;t have any hair to spare. The salon sold me a couple of very expensive products for thinning hair, including a scalp serum to leave on between shampoos, with instructions to shampoo my hair only ONCE PER WEEK if I wanted to save my hair!! I don&#x27;t know about you, but that just won&#x27;t work for me; having baby fine hair means there&#x27;s no way to cover up when it&#x27;s the slightest bit dirty or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to do some research on shampoos and thinning hair, long story short, I landed on Naturoli Soap Nuts shampoo. I was VERY hesitant to buy it when I read a couple of reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional shampoo (again, my fear of dirty/flat hair) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it lathered up in the shower just as much as any other shampoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as soon as I rinsed it out of my hair, I could feel a difference!  My hair felt like it had more volume even though it was wet. Then, when I combed through my hair, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and thick it felt AND I had some of my natural curl back that I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages. It looked so nice partially dry that I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not going to put any product on it&amp;#34; which is a huge big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once I dried my hair, it was so shiny, strong and manageable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My hair fell quite naturally into the beautiful cut my stylist gave me, and the ends seemed sealed/thick (which I&#x27;ve never experienced). So I had to have a second opinion because I couldn&#x27;t believe this stuff could really be this great. So I asked my daughter to try it. She&#x27;s living at home while attending graduate school and she has beautiful, waist long dark blond hair - but it&#x27;s a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it and her hair was glorious - shiny and beautiful with all of the curls she had when she was a little girl (she spent so many years straightening it, we both though the curls were gone for good). So now I&#x27;m back here at Amazon.com to buy a couple more bottles of this fantastic shampoo as I think mine is in danger of disappearing into the girls&#x27; apartment downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT and I think it will make anyone&#x27;s hair better; thick, thin, dry, oily, etc. and you actually get a lot for the price.  It&#x27;s not like you have to use a ton of it every time you wash your hair. So don&#x27;t hesitate like I did - just buy it :)</li>
            <li> everything is fine, thx</li>
            <li> Seriously can not believe how great this product is on my hair. At first, after about 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair. Than upon reading more about the product and learning it could take up to a week to see results, I continued use. And low behold, after a week or so of use, my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been! I usually use a conditioner and moisturizer but not anymore. My hair feels soft and looks great! Will absolutely be using this product for years to come and suggest it to friends.</li>
            <li> My hair is detoxing so its still getting used to the oils but regardless I&#x27;ve never had so much bounce and volume in my hair its pretty mindblowingly awesome worth every penny I even bought the norm to dry for my sister cause I love all the extra benefits you get and it is not harmful to ourselves and yet it performs better than any name brand s*** shampoo.  I have finer hair and it almost feels thicker. I&#x27;ve washed five times so far ....</li>
            <li> This product definitely exceeded my expectations. First, it arrived quickly and in very nice box. The shampoo could be given as a gift in its own box! Once I tried it, I absolutely loved it. My hair felt just amazing, to the point, that I couldnâ€™t stop touching it. I was so impressed with quality of NaturOli that I would happily convert all my household products to NaturOli brand. Nevertheless, I am only a student and I canâ€™t afford the brand long-term.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd time purchasing it. Best shampoo I have ever used so far. Hair feels great!! Just to keep down on the frizz that my hair naturally does, I also spray my hair with coconut oil. :)</li>
            <li> I tried going &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for three months and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results but still wanted a natural product and came by this. And its the best I have ever used. Left my hair soft with no conditioners.  I have very fine hair that tangles easily and have not had any issues with tangles but I do wait to brush my hair until it is dry. This will be the only shampoo I ever use again.  UPDATE: Though I still think it is a great product for most people it isn&#x27;t working the greatest for me any more.  It does leave my hair soft and shiny and If I had thicker hair, this would be the only shampoo for me.  But my hair is so fine and thin that this does not help at all.  My hair has no body at all and falls very limp.  It cleans well and leaves hair looking great with a natural shine but if you have fine thin hair like I do it will leave you with even thinner looking hair.  Still looking for my perfect product.  I wish it could be this.  I really do love it and think it would work great with anyone with average to thick hair or even curls.</li>
            <li> In the oily formula it&#x27;s the only shampoo (and we&#x27;ve tried SO MANY, natural, not natural) that keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair from looking oily so fast. She can actually go a day between washes when she uses this. And it looks really pretty and shiny too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this. The first time I washed my hair, it actually worked really well. It took build up off, my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy, my hair was soft and clean and it really surprised me that it actually worked. The second time on after? It was like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair at all. I don&#x27;t know what went wrong but I didn&#x27;t do anything differently. It was just a greasy mess!</li>
            <li> Horrible :-/! Strips my hair of all oils and gives it a waxy plastic texture! Will never buy again.. Complete waste of money! Not made for natural African American hair!</li>
            <li> I hardly EVER write reviews but if anyone is struggling with hair that&#x27;s clean one day, extra oily the next, and always itchy then hear me out. I&#x27;m 34, Asian, male with short black hair. I&#x27;m fit, eat right, take in plenty of exercise and water so my hair should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands and salon brands. Besides the smells, they all do the same things. My hair would feel ultra soft and clean right after rinsing but by the next day, my scalp would be itchy and hair flat from all the oil. Where did the oil come from?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I come online and order this. It&#x27;s not cheap but still cheaper than some of the salon brands. It has a very light smell to it. Unlike other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one lathers like crazy. A little goes a long way. It performs like regular shampoo. Rinses clean, my hair feels soft but by the next day my scalp is itchy and hair oily again. Money wasted I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already spent the money so I keep using it. Day by day I notice the hair is less oily. The itchiness is gone. By week 4, all my scalp issues were gone. It wasn&#x27;t until I went in for a haircut when my stylist mentioned my hair texture has changed. It&#x27;s stiffer. The strands seem thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m back to order my second bottle. The first lasted 3 months. I don&#x27;t use conditioner because I&#x27;m a guy and can&#x27;t be bothered but my hair never feels dry. Ive also received compliments on how jet black my hair is now and when light hits jet black hair, it&#x27;s shiny. SCORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
            <li> Thos product is WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
