            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>He swears it is simply the best, so I tried it</li>
            <li>I purchased this on subscribe and save to get a better deal -- its way cheaper than buying floss retail in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li>I love this floss and have used it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have continued to use this brand and type and love it, and this was a great price for a whole lot of them.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly to get all that extra stuff out.</li>
            <li>My favorite floss.</li>
            <li>I floss many times per day, this is the best floss available for my specific needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best one, others aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>it shreds easily.     </li>
            <li>This floss moves easily between even my tightest molars and never snags on any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is very mild and</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best floss if you have tight teeth  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST EVER floss for tightly packed teeth.</li>
            <li>This floss meets all 3 requirements: great price, slim enough to fit in between teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers.</li>
            <li>They glide smoothly on my gum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively cheap    </li>
            <li>The packaging here with multiples was a fantastic deal compared to grocery stores and I will never run out of dental floss again.</li>
            <li>Now I have enough for a lifetime LOL.</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>dispenser is straightforward and the floss never jams when pulling it</li>
            <li>mint flavor is pleasant, but not a big deal with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I bought 3 of these floss--one per family member, not cause they&#x27;re good-- and only one was off the dispenser).  </li>
            <li>Seems price was the only good things about this floss.</li>
            <li>My finger tips were pseudo-covered from just holding the floss (I do hold pretty snug), and they&#x27;d be around my teeth too!</li>
            <li>However, it turns out the 24-pack seems of a higher quality than the original I had.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We find the floss itself to be decent; the wax is a bit dry and does kind of crumble off sometimes, but its way better than \\&quot;store brand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>24-pack from Amazon is economical.     </li>
            <li>Again, an irritant if and when it happens, but fairly rare event for me to not worry about it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of floss over the years, and none have been really satisfactory until this particular floss.</li>
            <li>Leaves white bits of wax that EASILY come off, everywhere!</li>
            <li>Quick to do the whole mouth.</li>
            <li>We have tried many brands of floss, but this is the only one that does the job right.</li>
            <li>Good between tight contacts.</li>
            <li>Not only does this floss come in a very convenient, small, attractive, round case, but it turned out to be the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would pay more to get sturdier floss that I can buy in smaller quantity.  </li>
            <li>Such a better value than buying glide or</li>
            <li>I have only missed one day of flossing in years (probably 7 or 8 by now, maybe more).</li>
            <li>They are thinner, mint flavor, great to keep everywhere and not too thick.  </li>
            <li>overall, i&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and if you want to take care of your teeth</li>
            <li>Great floss - waxed and strong, this is still pretty thin so as to easily fit between tight teeth.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fairly easy to open it</li>
            <li>If you have a large family, this may be the quantity you need.  </li>
            <li>The large quantity was my fault.  </li>
            <li>We have tried any number of varieties from the dentist and nothing works as well, stays on our fingers as nicely or slides between our tight teeth without breaking.</li>
            <li>The price for a name brand like Oral B is very appealing, but it is thinner than the CVS brand I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>i am very content with the product and delivery</li>
            <li>My wife has very close contacts between her teeth.</li>
            <li>It tastes like mint and cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I would never have lasted with flossing this long if we didn&#x27;t have floss that made the job so easy.</li>
            <li>most other reviewers, my teeth are closer together.</li>
            <li>Besides all that, it ends up being cheaper than any of the other flosses I was buying - and has just many feet or meters of floss within.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold on to when dry, and when slobbered you can sill get a grip  4)</li>
            <li>It must have been my lucky day when I found this floss, because I only chose it from among the dozens of choices in the drugstore purely by chance.</li>
            <li>price is good (though it&#x27;s slightly cheaper at my local Walmart and Target).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No other brand works for my tight gaps, love this brand!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other floss, but they don&#x27;t seem to slide in between my teeth as easily as this one does.</li>
            <li>When I was no longer able to find my favorite floss—Oral B Essential Floss Waxed Mint—in any local store for the past year,  I resigned myself to the fact that companies always seem to “fix” a product when it ain’t broke.  </li>
            <li>Love this floss for narrow spaced/tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no fun getting those cavities filled so always</li>
            <li>The wax coating is a little flaky and comes off quite easily</li>
            <li>Dental hygienists have trouble flossing them, but with the Oral B essential floss, I can do it pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Although he hasn&#x27;t been as consistent as I, we have both seen considerable improvement in our gum health since flossing regularly.</li>
            <li>The tapes are too slippery (slide off the fingers), and are also tougher to fit in between tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>This floss is fantastic for getting into tight spots between teeth.  </li>
            <li>have no qualms at all about buying this floss in a large quantity such as this pack of 24.</li>
            <li>This is the only floss that really works for me.</li>
            <li>Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together and this floss is the ONLY one that I have found that works for this situation.</li>
            <li>Thought it&#x27;d be good, but WRONG.</li>
            <li>well worth the price compare to other products.</li>
            <li>I have tried different flosses during the years and this is the only one that really works.</li>
            <li>Very smooth - perfectly thin.</li>
            <li>This floss is thin enough to slide between my tight teeth and strong enough not to rip nor break when I remove the floss from between the tightly fitting teeth.</li>
            <li>I like that it is compact enough to fit in a small purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>I was initially hesitant to buy such a large quantity, which will likely last me 2 years.  </li>
            <li>these work well for me - get the job done without causing trouble of breaking; just the right thickness for me</li>
            <li>Less than a buck at Target, 97cents to be exact.</li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive, but  it doesn&#x27;t break or shred and fits between my crowded teeth where other flosses invariably shred or break.  </li>
            <li>Oral B, I don&#x27;t care much about your other products.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite dental floss for a long time - round and small packaging, thin with nice mint wax but not too much, goes into the tiniest crevices of my teeth and never EVER breaks unlike  some other dental floss......</li>
            <li>No other floss I&#x27;ve found meets these (very basic) requirements.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are placed tightly together, try this, you will certainly be well-satisfied.</li>
            <li>Sadly, they don&#x27;t have it available in normal supermarket anymore.</li>
            <li>The first few uses, I broke the floss several times, but soon learned a \\&quot;work around\\&quot; so it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and extra thin.</li>
            <li>have very tightly spaced teeth, and this is the first brand I&#x27;ve ever found that goes between all my teeth without shredding.</li>
            <li>ALL other floss I have tried either does not fit in between my teeth, or quickly shreds in the attempt.  </li>

            <li> Oral B, I don&#x27;t care much about your other products.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite dental floss for a long time - round and small packaging, thin with nice mint wax but not too much, goes into the tiniest crevices of my teeth and never EVER breaks unlike  some other dental floss......</li>
            <li> No other floss I&#x27;ve found meets these (very basic) requirements.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are placed tightly together, try this, you will certainly be well-satisfied.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they don&#x27;t have it available in normal supermarket anymore.</li>
            <li> The first few uses, I broke the floss several times, but soon learned a \\&quot;work around\\&quot; so it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and extra thin.</li>
            <li> have very tightly spaced teeth, and this is the first brand I&#x27;ve ever found that goes between all my teeth without shredding.</li>
            <li> ALL other floss I have tried either does not fit in between my teeth, or quickly shreds in the attempt.  </li>
            <li> The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I&#x27;ve tried, I won&#x27;t bother deducting points for that.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the other brand I tried is the only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; floss on the market, and since this stuff does all I expect of dental floss, I&#x27;ll not waste time trying other products.</li>
            <li> (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out.</li>
            <li> Also, the pictured item was not exactly the same as the last pack of floss that I have, which indicates “50 m/55 yd.”  </li>
            <li> I dislike their thick, broad tape floss which seems to have replaced the thin precise thread which fits between my teeth</li>
            <li> Essentials floss is simply the ONLY floss that works for the tight spaces in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only ones that fits (the other one is a colgate, that I get as a sample from my dentist but haven&#x27;t tried to buy it</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t rip or get caught between my extremely close teeth.  </li>
            <li> But this one feels quite gentle for my gums and is thin enough to pass between the teeth without having to tug or pull at it.  </li>
            <li> Also, this Oral-B floss was off dispenser once, like the other reviewer said, and I did have to pry the tiny round container open.</li>
            <li> Bought the Target store brand floss with the same price, and 99.9% LESS wax comes off, thought still some.    </li>
            <li> It is thinner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different varieties of floss and this one works well for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Other flosses broke and shredded several times during EACH flossing round.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep this product on the market, because I don&#x27;t have any other options.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They glide smoothly on my gum. I love it. Sadly, they don&#x27;t have it available in normal supermarket anymore. I have to buy it from Amazon only.</li>
            <li> Bought from Target cause it was the cheapest one and brand name. Thought it&#x27;d be good, but WRONG. Leaves white bits of wax that EASILY come off, everywhere! My finger tips were pseudo-covered from just holding the floss (I do hold pretty snug), and they&#x27;d be around my teeth too! Boooo!  Floss should take things OFF your teeth, NOT PUT them THERE!    Bought the Target store brand floss with the same price, and 99.9% LESS wax comes off, thought still some.    Also, this Oral-B floss was off dispenser once, like the other reviewer said, and I did have to pry the tiny round container open. Quite frustrating.  But mine was like that out of the box, and I think it stayed once I placed it correctly(btw, I bought 3 of these floss--one per family member, not cause they&#x27;re good-- and only one was off the dispenser).  Though I have bought &gt;20 flosses (Target store brand, brand names, etc) and only this one had that situation.    Seems price was the only good things about this floss. Less than a buck at Target, 97cents to be exact. I&#x27;m starting to lose faith in OralB.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this floss.  He swears it is simply the best, so I tried it and I too agree.  This floss will get the job done!  ctlp</li>
            <li> I prefer sturdy, but not ribbon, floss.  Oral B is a respected brand, but don&#x27;t feel this floss is sturdy enough for me.  It is thinner than I expected.  The first few uses, I broke the floss several times, but soon learned a \\&quot;work around\\&quot; so it wouldn&#x27;t break. The price for a name brand like Oral B is very appealing, but it is thinner than the CVS brand I usually buy.  It will take me at least two years to use the 24 54-yard packs, but I doubt I will buy this again.  I would pay more to get sturdier floss that I can buy in smaller quantity.  If you have a large family, this may be the quantity you need.  The large quantity was my fault.  I was too influenced by the low price.</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. Wax will glide between the teeth effortlessly, and won&#x27;t leave your hand sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss that really works for me. My teeth are tight together. Dental hygienists have trouble flossing them, but with the Oral B essential floss, I can do it pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Why do I like this floss?  Because:    1) It doesn&#x27;t break  2) It gets in between my tight teeth without getting stuck  3) It&#x27;s easy to hold on to when dry, and when slobbered you can sill get a grip  4) It&#x27;s relatively cheap    No other floss I&#x27;ve found meets these (very basic) requirements.</li>
            <li> Great floss - waxed and strong, this is still pretty thin so as to easily fit between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth is crowded, and I have multiple crowns.    ALL other floss I have tried either does not fit in between my teeth, or quickly shreds in the attempt.  This includes: Oral B Ultra, the entire Reach line and all others.    Essentials floss is simply the ONLY floss that works for the tight spaces in between my teeth.  I am thrilled to see the 24 pack offered.  I hope they keep this product on the market, because I don&#x27;t have any other options.    I have tried them all, and only Essentials works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on subscribe and save to get a better deal -- its way cheaper than buying floss retail in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, 24 packs is alot of floss, so unless you don&#x27;t mind stockpiling it, this might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We find the floss itself to be decent; the wax is a bit dry and does kind of crumble off sometimes, but its way better than \\&quot;store brand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers. This is my favorite floss. It is very inexpensive, but  it doesn&#x27;t break or shred and fits between my crowded teeth where other flosses invariably shred or break.  Such a better value than buying glide or similar plastic tape flosses which are expensive and I hate the way they feel. This is great and I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> i am very content with the product and delivery&lt;br /&gt;Tony Pagano</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around &amp; around w/ floss, trying all sorts.  The tapes are too slippery (slide off the fingers), and are also tougher to fit in between tight teeth.  This floss meets all 3 requirements: great price, slim enough to fit in between teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers.</li>
            <li> It works. Actually, it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.    Unlike other dental floss, they actually mean it when they decided to describe their product as \\&quot;shed-resistant\\&quot;.  24-pack from Amazon is economical.     Oral B, I don&#x27;t care much about your other products. But this one is irreplaceable.   If you would consider stop manufacturing something, please let this one be the very last.</li>
            <li> I love this floss and have used it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most other reviewers, my teeth are closer together. This is one of the only ones that fits (the other one is a colgate, that I get as a sample from my dentist but haven&#x27;t tried to buy it yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax does come off, which is an irritant but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good (though it&#x27;s slightly cheaper at my local Walmart and Target).&lt;br /&gt;I saw one reviewer had some issue with the floss receding into the dispenser. I have used at least 40/50 of these over the years. That has happened twice to me. But it&#x27;s fairly easy to open it (you need to pry it open with something sharp enough) and get the floss out. Again, an irritant if and when it happens, but fairly rare event for me to not worry about it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I started a &amp;#34;contest&amp;#34; after we both started seeing the dentist regularly again. Although he hasn&#x27;t been as consistent as I, we have both seen considerable improvement in our gum health since flossing regularly. I have only missed one day of flossing in years (probably 7 or 8 by now, maybe more). This is the only floss we buy. We have tried any number of varieties from the dentist and nothing works as well, stays on our fingers as nicely or slides between our tight teeth without breaking. I would never have lasted with flossing this long if we didn&#x27;t have floss that made the job so easy.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite dental floss for a long time - round and small packaging, thin with nice mint wax but not too much, goes into the tiniest crevices of my teeth and never EVER breaks unlike  some other dental floss......The packaging here with multiples was a fantastic deal compared to grocery stores and I will never run out of dental floss again. Remember to floss your teeth AT LEAST twice a day! It&#x27;s no fun getting those cavities filled so always floss!!</li>
            <li> Best floss you can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Have always used these.  They are thinner, mint flavor, great to keep everywhere and not too thick.  Huge fan!!</li>
            <li> Great floss. Good between tight contacts.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss we buy in my house. It&#x27;s strong and extra thin. My wife has very close contacts between her teeth. We have tried many brands of floss, but this is the only one that does the job right.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss if you have tight teeth  ten nine eight seven six five four three two one</li>
            <li> No other brand works for my tight gaps, love this brand!</li>
            <li> Good price and is the type of floss that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Delivery – great&lt;br /&gt;Cheap but extremely good product.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good using it!&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> i wish amazon sold a pack smaller than 24. that&#x27;s a lot of floss...    pros:  nice and minty. thinner than the colgate brand i switched from. it&#x27;s easier to get in between my tightly-packed teeth.     cons:  it shreds easily.     overall, i&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I will buy. My teeth are very tightly crowded. I&#x27;ve used other brands that would get stuck once in between the teeth - making me feel like I&#x27;d pull a tooth out removing it. Some brands were so thick, I felt I was trying to shove a thick wedge between my teeth, and never managed to slide them in. Tape types were beyond hopeless in my mouth since the tape twists. The winner for me is Oral B Essentials. Very smooth - perfectly thin. Gets between the teeth with no trouble at all. Quick to do the whole mouth. Never cuts my gums. The floss can shred a little bit, but no worse than any other I&#x27;ve tried, I won&#x27;t bother deducting points for that. Besides all that, it ends up being cheaper than any of the other flosses I was buying - and has just many feet or meters of floss within. What&#x27;s not to like? I hope they make it forever.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST EVER floss for tightly packed teeth. But Amazon - PLEASE provide a smaller quantity option for those of us who cannot afford the 24pk price. This would be a great ADD-ON item.</li>
            <li> Very good product . I will order it again when it runs out and also recommend my friends to buy it</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of floss over the years, and none have been really satisfactory until this particular floss. It must have been my lucky day when I found this floss, because I only chose it from among the dozens of choices in the drugstore purely by chance. I was looking for a dental floss in a small container to carry in my purse. Not only does this floss come in a very convenient, small, attractive, round case, but it turned out to be the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very tightly spaced teeth, and this is the first brand I&#x27;ve ever found that goes between all my teeth without shredding. It is a thin-but-strong, lightly waxed floss which slides between every tooth with delightful ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no qualms at all about buying this floss in a large quantity such as this pack of 24.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time funding this floss in Tucson, AZ. Now I have enough for a lifetime LOL.</li>
            <li> I have tried different flosses during the years and this is the only one that really works. It tastes like mint and cleans your teeth very well. It&#x27;s seriously the best one, others aren&#x27;t as good. It&#x27;s not expensive and if you want to take care of your teeth then you definitely need it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local drug store, not Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have crowded teeth which caused a big-name competitor&#x27;s floss to fray. This floss moves easily between even my tightest molars and never snags on any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is straightforward and the floss never jams when pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor is pleasant, but not a big deal with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people, including me initially, probably would not expect to see such a difference in performance for what is basically waxed string, but there is. Perhaps the other brand I tried is the only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; floss on the market, and since this stuff does all I expect of dental floss, I&#x27;ll not waste time trying other products.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to use. If you don&#x27;t like to floss, this makes it easier. I use it nightly and have for years. Recommended.</li>
            <li> these work well for me - get the job done without causing trouble of breaking; just the right thickness for me</li>
            <li> We have continued to use this brand and type and love it, and this was a great price for a whole lot of them.</li>
            <li> This floss is fantastic for getting into tight spots between teeth.  The mint flavor is very mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss glides well without being too slippery... I have found that with the &#x27;silk&#x27; style floss, it is not abrasive enough to get the plaque out.  This floss has the best of both worlds, it is smooth but also gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to buy this floss in bulk via Amazon is great - allows for a good discount over buying it one pack at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other floss, but they don&#x27;t seem to slide in between my teeth as easily as this one does. Works perfectly to get all that extra stuff out. And it&#x27;s got a great mint after taste!</li>
            <li> Great product. well worth the price compare to other products. Does a great &amp; clean job. My favorite floss. I used to buy them in Walmart for $0.97/each. However, they don&#x27;t carry them anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t rip or get caught between my extremely close teeth.  I highly recommend checking it out.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different varieties of floss and this one works well for my teeth.  Others have been quite thick or too stiff.  But this one feels quite gentle for my gums and is thin enough to pass between the teeth without having to tug or pull at it.  The wax coating is a little flaky and comes off quite easily (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant to be this way or not).  I like that it is compact enough to fit in a small purse or pocket.  I have ordered this pack because it worked out cheaper than buying from a store and also I have found It difficult to find it in stores at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of floss that does not shred or break for me.  It is hard to find in stores.  Ordered it on Amazon and just flossed without breakage.  Yee-Haw.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss that works for me. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Not sure why. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I use dental floss before I brush my teeth. Some of my teeth press together tightly. I have tried other dental floss, and they always rip or break apart when I floss my tight teeth. This floss is thin enough to slide between my tight teeth and strong enough not to rip nor break when I remove the floss from between the tightly fitting teeth. Finally a dental floss that works for me.</li>
            <li> When I was no longer able to find my favorite floss—Oral B Essential Floss Waxed Mint—in any local store for the past year,  I resigned myself to the fact that companies always seem to “fix” a product when it ain’t broke.  I dislike their thick, broad tape floss which seems to have replaced the thin precise thread which fits between my teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it occurred to me to check online, where I found the 24-pack on Amazon.  I was initially hesitant to buy such a large quantity, which will likely last me 2 years.  Also, the pictured item was not exactly the same as the last pack of floss that I have, which indicates “50 m/55 yd.”  However, it turns out the 24-pack seems of a higher quality than the original I had.  It is smoother, without any obvious waxy patches.  I am happy I have a stash of exactly what I need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would make a plea to Oral-B to re-instate the thin floss, and even consider bringing back the 100 m length.</li>
            <li> Love this floss for narrow spaced/tight teeth.  Very worth it.</li>
            <li> Best Floss, doesn&#x27;t shred when teeth are closely placed. I have tried every floss on the market, this is the only floss that works with my dental structure. My teeth are very close together and this floss is the ONLY one that I have found that works for this situation. This floss has not shredded or broken once during my 3 month test period. Other flosses broke and shredded several times during EACH flossing round. I floss many times per day, this is the best floss available for my specific needs. If your teeth are placed tightly together, try this, you will certainly be well-satisfied.</li>
