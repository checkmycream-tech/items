            <li>I love opening it.</li>
            <li>But that might just be a me problem since it happens with most mascaras i buy.</li>
            <li>If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li>so I would say it&#x27;s more for teenagers than adults.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>again I ordered two more quantities for them.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>But for the most part you get what you pay for and that&#x27;s a box of makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this way of shopping</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I will be ordering one for me!</li>

            <li>what&#x27;s on the inside you might enjoy it.</li>

            <li>Its def worth 10 bucks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality for such a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Teens can be hard to buy for, she said it was awesome.</li>
            <li>It made a nice gift for a young woman who has about everything.</li>
            <li>Some nice colors but made with cheap materials and low quality make up.  </li>
            <li>Received this just in time for my nephews wedding, it was nice having everything in such a compact container, no way to misplace anything.</li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>The case attractive, and makes it look more expensive.</li>
            <li>Full make up set, pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend and she was only ok with it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly titillate her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely smaller than it looks, but it has all the components that it&#x27;s supposed to. :)</li>
            <li>Price was right and shipping fast.</li>
            <li>They like this so much.</li>

            <li>Very pleased with the long lasting wear of this make up.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the main reasons I picked this one...</li>
            <li>I wish the make up stayed on a little better, and the mascara rubs off onto my face.</li>
            <li>Mascara, eye liner, and a few brushs, Its so cute and</li>
            <li>her make up and each time she emerges, I am wowed by her new look.</li>

            <li>The compact is very small and easy to travel with on business trips!</li>
            <li>like the old fashioned dime store makeup</li>
            <li>As for an adult, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my 7 year old niece for a just because gift.</li>
            <li>because it is &amp;#34;a complete kit&amp;#34</li>

            <li> The compact is very small and easy to travel with on business trips!</li>
            <li> like the old fashioned dime store makeup</li>
            <li> As for an adult, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my 7 year old niece for a just because gift.</li>
            <li> because it is &amp;#34;a complete kit&amp;#34</li>
            <li> old niece.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not huge.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten year old daughter as play make-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who is just starting into makeup.  </li>
            <li> One of the try sliders was broken but still works ok</li>
            <li> The first kit I got on amazon was a few dollars less and super small.</li>
            <li> I got this make up set for my wife who is generally not into using make up</li>
            <li> Rated only four stars because not sure about how long it stays on since I didn&#x27;t personally use it.</li>
            <li> it was a little smaller than i thought it would be,but it does have a variety of makeup and works well for her.</li>
            <li> only thing is the case could be a little sturdier</li>
            <li> and since then she has spent time and time in the bathroom putting on</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO mascara in this kit.  </li>
            <li> I got it reading the other reviews</li>
            <li> They show this kit to other family and friend.</li>
            <li> I was reading through past posts about this item being smaller than the picture..</li>
            <li> The count on all the other pieces is way off too.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, at first, I was scared they sent me the wrong one</li>
            <li> If I was to have kept it, I would have ran out in less then a month.</li>
            <li> but the product is entirely bad because I got the entire kit damaged, there are certain portions missing inside.</li>
            <li> This like the other I bought was a little disappointing because the mascara was dried up and one of the eye shadow brushes broke after first use.</li>
            <li> But the kit doesn&#x27;t seem too sturdy and it&#x27;s a little clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Also, it was very hard to even get open</li>
            <li> And a little bit of the powder was creeping out of the sides which I call a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this kit while traveling but after using it at home, I&#x27;ve found it to be messy;  the blush and eye powders tend to mix together.  </li>
            <li> She uses it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> It measures about 6 3/4&amp;#34; wide and 2&amp;#34; thick.  </li>
            <li> Soo much in a small case.</li>
            <li> I carry a sepreate set of brushes as the included set is too small for me to handle.</li>
            <li> The compact is a little awkward to carry and open.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, however-- I do have to say, that my daughter who just turned 13 years old, LOVES IT!!</li>
            <li> but man when it got here its very small compared to picture</li>
            <li> Delecate though and box can be broken while shipment.</li>
            <li> The different drawers and fold out sections had everything from a powder base, to eye-liner, mascara, rouge, lipstick, and eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> For $13, you can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> It has all the basics and with it you can be flashy or casual.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s broken :(</li>
            <li> 3 blush, eye base cream, 6 lip stain.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this for my ten year old daughter as play make-up. I find myself borrowing it more and more. The eye shadow colors are so pretty. I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> My girls absolutely loved it, this product is perfect for my teens. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I got it but..it&#x27;s broken :(</li>
            <li> i bought this for my daughter and she loves it but man when it got here its very small compared to picture</li>
            <li> quality is not the best, so like everybody says. you get what you pay for.. not big a big deal</li>
            <li> Full make up set, pretty decent. Many colors avaliable for eyeshadow and blusher. The colours are very light when applied, so its best if you like light makeup. Delecate though and box can be broken while shipment.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling. It is compact and has everything you need. The color choices are good as well.</li>
            <li> This thing is very cute. Comes with tons of eyeshadow, even directions on the side of the box. Has one powder foundation. 3 blush, eye base cream, 6 lip stain. Mascara, eye liner, and a few brushs, Its so cute and I love opening it. I wish the make up stayed on a little better, and the mascara rubs off onto my face. But that might just be a me problem since it happens with most mascaras i buy. Its def worth 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and have already used it 3 times. Great product, came in perfect shape. I would recommend this to anyone. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. It&#x27;s good quality for such a cheap product. The only thing is that the eyeshadows are all glittery so I would say it&#x27;s more for teenagers than adults. I love it.</li>
            <li> Received this just in time for my nephews wedding, it was nice having everything in such a compact container, no way to misplace anything.</li>
            <li> This was for me. I like the size. It is great for traveling. This like the other I bought was a little disappointing because the mascara was dried up and one of the eye shadow brushes broke after first use.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the long lasting wear of this make up.  It feels like and airy on m skin and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two make kits for my wife and sister. They like this so much. it is so compact kit and all the items/material and colors are of very good quality. They show this kit to other family and friend. They also liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again I ordered two more quantities for them. They all are completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for daughter, she loved everything about ,the size was perfect,and everything inside was great quality product,thank you</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for my daughter. she loves it, fits in her purse, or travel bag, makeup is perfect. the size is great. A winner!The price is reasonable also.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift. The person was pleased. Lots of variety in one package for different looks. Rated only four stars because not sure about how long it stays on since I didn&#x27;t personally use it.</li>
            <li> daughter loved it, perfect for her.  she carries it everywhere.  only thing is the case could be a little sturdier</li>
            <li> The colors are great!  The compact is very small and easy to travel with on business trips! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this kit while traveling but after using it at home, I&#x27;ve found it to be messy;  the blush and eye powders tend to mix together.  Rather than take it on the road I&#x27;ll use it at home.</li>
            <li> It is very  nice product to buy..&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend others to buy it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again thanks</li>
            <li> Very good product and my niece loves it.  never realised its bigger than it looks from online.  i am planning to buy some friends in the future.  Nice goodies for a smart price.</li>
            <li> My niece loved it.I gave as a Christmas gift. Teens can be hard to buy for, she said it was awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy!! It exceeded expectations!! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Very nice set.  Only drawback is all the eyeshadow is frosted.  I could do without the glittery look.  But all in all, it&#x27;s a very nice set, gorgeous box, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these as gifts for a bunch of tween girls at a slumber party. They were a hit. Not the best quality of makeup, but for a girls night in of beauty it did the trick.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teenage grandaughter to play around with.  As for an adult, I don&#x27;t think so.  Price was right and shipping fast.</li>
            <li> For $13, you can not go wrong with this product. It has all the basics and with it you can be flashy or casual. It is compact and easy to travel with. Although the make up might not be the best quality, for this price, it&#x27;s completely worth it. Mine came in the mail and was not damaged at all, and I have not had a problem with anything breaking. The case attractive, and makes it look more expensive. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this make up set for my wife who is generally not into using make up and since then she has spent time and time in the bathroom putting on her make up and each time she emerges, I am wowed by her new look. I will recommend it to anyone who likes putting on make up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who is just starting into makeup.  Perfect! Everything she needs is all in one package.  It folds up easily and fits in her overnight bag!</li>
            <li> she said it was so cute and could fit right in her purse and the colors were to die for. lol No powders wre damaged at all. great shipping.</li>
            <li> This make up kit was more then I expected. I purchased three of them.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the quality of the make up and would definetely reccomend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller than I thought. I gave it to my 7 year old niece for a just because gift. I would like to search for something for a grown woman instead. If I was to have kept it, I would have ran out in less then a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend and she was only ok with it. It didn&#x27;t exactly titillate her and it was also a lot smaller than what the descriptions bring you to believe.</li>
            <li> Makee me look like beyonce twin girl, u better work!!! Okayyyy!!! Snap snap. Get this if you wnt to spend 8 mins in the mirror looking sexay!!!</li>
            <li> I was reading through past posts about this item being smaller than the picture.. I&#x27;m not sure if we are looking at the same thing, but it was exactly the size I thought it would be. I love everything about this cute makeup kit. I&#x27;m glad I decided to get it.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO mascara in this kit.  This is one of the main reasons I picked this one...because it is &amp;#34;a complete kit&amp;#34;.  It isn&#x27;t even listed on the box.  The count on all the other pieces is way off too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. If you are someone who thinks size matters than this is not the product for you. But if you think it&#x27;s all about the quality and  what&#x27;s on the inside you might enjoy it. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not huge. And a little bit of the powder was creeping out of the sides which I call a bit messy. But for the most part you get what you pay for and that&#x27;s a box of makeup. Also, it was very hard to even get open and then when you try to slide the drawers that&#x27;s another challenge. Will I buy again? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is one feel good moment provided by my niece who is the owner. She does want to point out there is a great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> I liked this make-up set because it has everything you need to refresh your make-up in one package.  The different drawers and fold out sections had everything from a powder base, to eye-liner, mascara, rouge, lipstick, and eye shadow.  It also contains applicators.  It made a nice gift for a young woman who has about everything.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this.  She uses it almost everyday.  She finally knows what a difference it is to use a quality product instead of using cheap stuff from the discount stores.</li>
            <li> One of the try sliders was broken but still works ok</li>
            <li> When I received the product, at first, I was scared they sent me the wrong one till I opened it up. It&#x27;s definitely smaller than it looks, but it has all the components that it&#x27;s supposed to. :)</li>
            <li> This kit was perfect for my tween daughter!  She loves it and it is the perfect size. It is nice and compact to travel nicely.</li>
            <li> My young granddaughter is experimenting with her new &#x27;glamor face.&#x27; But the kit doesn&#x27;t seem too sturdy and it&#x27;s a little clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, it&#x27;s worth it and it gives her a chance to &#x27;find her style.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! And it was here in jus two days! keep it up guys, you make me look beautiful!</li>
            <li> The price is great and this has everything I needed and it came in right on time. I love this way of shopping</li>
            <li> The compact is a little awkward to carry and open. Suits its purpose for basic colors to choose from. I carry a sepreate set of brushes as the included set is too small for me to handle.</li>
            <li> Some nice colors but made with cheap materials and low quality make up.  Had to return and look for different brand.</li>
            <li> loved it, use it every day</li>
            <li> This is a really nice make up kit. I got this for my 11 yr. old niece. The first kit I got on amazon was a few dollars less and super small. Pay the extra $ and get this one. It measures about 6 3/4&amp;#34; wide and 2&amp;#34; thick.  Cant wait to give this to her.</li>
