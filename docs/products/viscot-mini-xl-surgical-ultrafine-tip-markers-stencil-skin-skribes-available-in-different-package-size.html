            <li>These markers have always worked great for  me.</li>
            <li>They were great &amp; came earlyüëè</li>
            <li>Works great good deal great seller</li>
            <li>Got here slower than I thought but good markers</li>
            <li>and then you are good to go.</li>
            <li>These minnies mark very fine lines which is great.</li>
            <li>these markers work wonderful and delivery was right on time also</li>
            <li>Transfers onto the skin smoothly!</li>
            <li>These are great fine line markers but it doesn&#x27;t take much to kill the tip.</li>
            <li>And love the fine tip.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to make detailed corrections with this.</li>
            <li>JUST FOR FREE HAND DRAWING, EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>some were dried up but the rest were great thanks</li>
            <li>It writes good at first then dies down like it ran out of ink.</li>
            <li>NOT EXTRA FINE PENS!</li>
            <li>Otherwise..super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t complete free hand drawing for tattooing.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need them to do.</li>
            <li>These are good for the first and second use then they dry up immediately.</li>
            <li>Be sure to write on completely dry skin after you wipe with alcohol.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but item did not work like I thought it would.</li>

            <li>Other then that they are ok..</li>
            <li>Only good for two lines literally a waste of money</li>
            <li>the other 2 worked ok not a big thing</li>
            <li>They were great at the start, but within a day I went threw all 5 because they dried right up, so I took of the back and noticed they hardly had any ink in them?!</li>
            <li>and they actually don&#x27;t work on the skin very well at all.</li>
            <li>Dry out FAST</li>
            <li>They dry out so fast</li>
            <li>Only problem is they bleed out of the line when marked on the skin.</li>

            <li> These markers do not work. They will wipe off as soon as you go to wipe of where you just tattooed and they actually don&#x27;t work on the skin very well at all. I would definitely not buy these.</li>

            <li> Very nice pens! Transfers onto the skin smoothly! Best product I&#x27;ve bought to go along with tattooing!</li>
            <li> The ink in the marker bleeds trough the skin making it harder to outline</li>
            <li> This product states that it is a &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; tip marker. When I opened the marker to examine it, it was different than the picture shown. In the picture the marker tip looks &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but the makers I received were not. It was the size of a regular marker. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again for I can just use regular markers. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to make detailed corrections with this.</li>
            <li> These are good for the first and second use then they dry up immediately. I would not recommend these at all, a total waste of money.</li>
