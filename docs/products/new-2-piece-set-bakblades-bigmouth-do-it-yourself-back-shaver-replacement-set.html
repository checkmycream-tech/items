            <li>This is the best back shaver ever invented.  </li>
            <li>ALOT BETTER THAN GETTING WAXED EVERY MONTH.</li>

            <li>seems that im just keep covering more and more territory.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!!</li>
            <li>Bakblade works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job then the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>You get many uses out of each blade and it works SO MUCH BETTER than any razor and shaving cream combo.</li>
            <li>bakBLADE is the best of the bunch--it basically is a big shave blade that cleanly shaves the back,but</li>
            <li>I used it dry, no shaving cream or anything - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>In using this blade with the bakblade handle (see my review under this product for a more detailed explanation)</li>
            <li>This works much better than the original blade they came out with.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Feeling like a nice light back scratch , it was pleasant and effortless .</li>
            <li>NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO EASY</li>
            <li>Easy to replace</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to install and use.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly easy to use and does the job well.</li>
            <li>Love the back blade and this is a great deal for the blades.</li>
            <li>I used to use a electric man groomer and hands down, this is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>A Fine Seller who sells Merchandise that does what is advertised to</li>
            <li>It arrived today - quick shipping!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>Finally something that works great for me.</li>
            <li>These blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li>None of these cut as close and smooth as&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;BakBlade&amp;#34; Shaver.</li>
            <li>It is still a great buy if you want to get rid of that unwanted back hair.</li>
            <li>Great product and I will tell my hairy back friends.</li>
            <li>Since I do not have the product yet, I cannot comment on the product, however, I would like to say that Matt seems like a fantastic person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>how smooth a shave it is.</li>
            <li>Great way to shave your back.  </li>
            <li>same as the original, the refill works great, and causes no razor bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li>I have yet to have use them because the original blade is still doing its job.</li>
            <li>Had a battery operated one for many years and every tile I used it, I was left with many many cuts and bleeding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I can do it myself and not have to depend on some body else.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love the product and would love it more if they could put a soap strip on it, similar to the Intuition razor although I realize that is a trademarked product.</li>
            <li>The shaver I originally bought was no longer available but this product was even better, trust me@  Would certainly buy again</li>
            <li>are the most cost effective way to keep your back hairless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gotta have my clean look</li>
            <li>I am not one to write  reviews so this product is good enough to make me do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m have fairly sparse back hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>, I got a call from Matt, he said he wants to send me one more bakBalde via fedex 1-day priority the moment he saw my feedback.</li>
            <li>But Matt wasn&#x27;t too worried about the money and said he wants me to have the product and make sure I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the Bigmouth device and the blades do really well.</li>
            <li>Good simple quick solution.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quick and easy and shaves very close!  </li>
            <li>In the past, I have tried many things, but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>but it is a great product and should be used by any guy who wants to remove the hair on their back.</li>
            <li>Decent product, make sure you have adequate mirrors to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and look forward to using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a good long while.  </li>
            <li>It really cleaned easily as well.  </li>
            <li>They are much sharper and dont clog as easily.</li>
            <li>This one is very smooth and no cuts so far.</li>
            <li>Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a overall good product (The whole set up).</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it for maintaining a beach body.</li>
            <li>With this, I&#x27;m able to clean my back up quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Hands down, THE best back groomer out there -</li>
            <li>Shipping is kinda high, esp since I&#x27;m used to getting it free with prime.</li>
            <li>love it so much did not want to be without new blades to replace when the time comes</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product which is great not only for use on my back, but also general \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you suffered from the Cro-Mag disease that had you resemble the &amp;#34;missing link&amp;#34; more than a human on the beach, this device is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding.</li>
            <li>I used the man groomer and that was alright, but took forever with the smaller head and wasn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought the original BakSpa model and now the new Bigmouth blades.</li>
            <li>But the baKblade really works well!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li>Only suggestion is a bit more curve to its shaft.</li>
            <li>It may be better to hold off purchasing additional blades until you actually need them, unless you can store them in humid-free areas.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think of it first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first blade ..</li>
            <li>First time it takes some getting used to</li>
            <li>We purchased a replacement pack when we originally purchased the bakblade in mid July 2013, my HAIRY husband has used the ORIGINAL RAZOR</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you have to make sure no bumps or back acne because it will go along with the hair and bleed.</li>
            <li>I used the first blade for over a year - probably 2 times per month -</li>
            <li>Outstanding blade,  I would recommend this product to any man who needs to groom their back.</li>
            <li>I got 4 shaves out of my first blade.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip -</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough on how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works great and feels just like a high grade back scratcher (comfortable) but remove hair extremely well!</li>
            <li>It will give you a clean sharp shave, very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The new blades fit in the original handle, and are a big improvement.</li>
            <li>If you have the hairy back problem as most men do, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Two bases for $13 is pretty high, but I&#x27;m willing to pay that for a product that works.</li>
            <li>If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it..  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like the feeling of a freshly shorn back--free of the fur that embarrassed me, made my clothes fit weird...and now, I am like a normal human again, and I can turn in my ape-card.</li>
            <li>They do a great job wet or dry .  </li>
            <li>But after about use three on a new blade, it settles in to almost like a back scratcher and is good for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Great for the bak blade, they don&#x27;t stay sharp for as long as i&#x27;d like them too</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well it removed hair with no discomfort, actually with a pleasant feeling of getting your back scratched.</li>
            <li>and i have to say it has been a much needed tool.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Takes only a couple of minutes to get a smooth shave without having to ask for help.</li>
            <li>These blades work very well and they seem very durable.</li>
            <li>This was a real find.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The razor and blades are very well thought out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to change the blade.</li>
            <li>They really shaves close</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>&#x27;ll real</li>
            <li>Thanks baKBlade</li>
            <li>And I really don&#x27;t have to touch up as often as I thought.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a very durable product and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairy beast and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that gives a nice clean look and that I can do myself without missing spots.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s intended shave, but it works, and is probably better and cheaper than other options out there.</li>
            <li>Product was easy to use - the change out with the old blades was simple and fast - I recommend.</li>
            <li>for 10-15 good shaves is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Then again they may have a special rust-proof coating I am unaware of.</li>
            <li>They give a much more thorough shave in less time.</li>
            <li>but after multiple uses, it has proven itself worthy of praise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hairy guy and the longevity for me has been decent.</li>
            <li>and I have still been unable to injure myself which is pretty remarkable because I can cut myself with any razor.</li>
            <li>(More at my review for the back SPA Big Mouth handle.)&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve find you want to go easy on the first few uses of this thing...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get.</li>
            <li>Unlike normal razor blades, these won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>but I still have to occasionally get fresh ones.  </li>
            <li>Amazing grooming tool for your back, say goodbye to &amp;#34;honey can you please shave my back&amp;#34; The blade is extremely sharp, I won&#x27;t recommend using it without applying shaving cream to your back first.</li>
            <li>After using several products that claimed to be easy to reach the middle of my back...I was resigned to the thought that I&#x27;d be sitting in the window of Mr. Peebles Pet shop for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>I got the replacement blades for the obvious reason and they came quickly and are completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just placed an order for the new 3 pack blade set.</li>
            <li>Priced very reasonable given how well they are built and last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21, have pretty gnarly back hair, and this product removed it with ease.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just have a means to quickly replace the blades in my new shaver, however I have slight concerns regarding them lasting long enough (e.g. not rusting)</li>
            <li>perhaps the best feature is the ease with which I can shave my back; no longer do I need to rely on either other people (which can be awkward) or trying other products that have so many moving parts.  </li>
            <li>Updated design slightly less friction than original.</li>
            <li>Its so large that I can shave my whole back within about 5 minutes, and I only have to replace the blades after about eight uses.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I have a very hairy back</li>
            <li>but I still get razor burn no matter how gentle a shave my back.</li>
            <li>and this is only product that I&#x27;ve found that really works.</li>
            <li>confirmed delivery but could not give me the information on who collected it as our office has two buildings adjacent to each other and different people collect packages all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it dry and still on the first blade.</li>
            <li>AT LEAST 7 times and STILL does not feel he needs to change the ORIGINAL blade out yet!</li>
            <li>Only back shaving product that really works!</li>
            <li>The blades last a decent while, they&#x27;re a bit pricey but</li>
            <li>I would have been content to pay around $5 total per blade, but the high prices have given me a reason to re-design the cartridge using a 3D printer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big guy and very hairy back.</li>
            <li>Only takes a few seconds and clean as a whistle.  </li>
            <li>so the blade doesn&#x27;t get wet from shower moisture (even stainless steel rusts).</li>
            <li>You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li>It is so much quicker and easier that other shaving methods or chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my whole upper body and did it in half the time it took with electric clippers.</li>

            <li> if they had something that would clip my tail.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bakBlade is the best back shaver, PERIOD!  </li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver ever invented.  </li>
            <li> ALOT BETTER THAN GETTING WAXED EVERY MONTH.</li>
            <li> He said it still shaves as smooth &amp; close as the 1st use and until it doesn&#x27;t, he sees no point in changing it!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the product.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s grown up now and doesn&#x27;t want to do it any more.</li>

            <li> have not seen this type of a customer service in many products that we buy these days.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I will be go ahead and purchase one more just to make sure</li>
            <li> now, I can only rate the customer service and it is definitely excellent!</li>
            <li> seems that im just keep covering more and more territory.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!!</li>
            <li> Bakblade works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job then the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> You get many uses out of each blade and it works SO MUCH BETTER than any razor and shaving cream combo.</li>
            <li> bakBLADE is the best of the bunch--it basically is a big shave blade that cleanly shaves the back,but</li>
            <li> I used it dry, no shaving cream or anything - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> In using this blade with the bakblade handle (see my review under this product for a more detailed explanation)</li>
            <li> This works much better than the original blade they came out with.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Feeling like a nice light back scratch , it was pleasant and effortless .</li>
            <li> NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO EASY</li>
            <li> Easy to replace</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to install and use.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly easy to use and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Love the back blade and this is a great deal for the blades.</li>
            <li> I used to use a electric man groomer and hands down, this is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> A Fine Seller who sells Merchandise that does what is advertised to</li>
            <li> It arrived today - quick shipping!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Fast and effective.  </li>
            <li> Finally something that works great for me.</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li> None of these cut as close and smooth as&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;BakBlade&amp;#34; Shaver.</li>
            <li> It is still a great buy if you want to get rid of that unwanted back hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and I will tell my hairy back friends.</li>
            <li> Since I do not have the product yet, I cannot comment on the product, however, I would like to say that Matt seems like a fantastic person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how smooth a shave it is.</li>
            <li> Great way to shave your back.  </li>
            <li> same as the original, the refill works great, and causes no razor bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have use them because the original blade is still doing its job.</li>
            <li> Had a battery operated one for many years and every tile I used it, I was left with many many cuts and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I can do it myself and not have to depend on some body else.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the product and would love it more if they could put a soap strip on it, similar to the Intuition razor although I realize that is a trademarked product.</li>
            <li> The shaver I originally bought was no longer available but this product was even better, trust me@  Would certainly buy again</li>
            <li> are the most cost effective way to keep your back hairless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gotta have my clean look</li>
            <li> I am not one to write  reviews so this product is good enough to make me do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m have fairly sparse back hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> , I got a call from Matt, he said he wants to send me one more bakBalde via fedex 1-day priority the moment he saw my feedback.</li>
            <li> But Matt wasn&#x27;t too worried about the money and said he wants me to have the product and make sure I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the Bigmouth device and the blades do really well.</li>
            <li> Good simple quick solution.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quick and easy and shaves very close!  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried many things, but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> but it is a great product and should be used by any guy who wants to remove the hair on their back.</li>
            <li> Decent product, make sure you have adequate mirrors to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and look forward to using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a good long while.  </li>
            <li> It really cleaned easily as well.  </li>
            <li> They are much sharper and dont clog as easily.</li>
            <li> This one is very smooth and no cuts so far.</li>
            <li> Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a overall good product (The whole set up).</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it for maintaining a beach body.</li>
            <li> With this, I&#x27;m able to clean my back up quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best back groomer out there -</li>
            <li> Shipping is kinda high, esp since I&#x27;m used to getting it free with prime.</li>
            <li> love it so much did not want to be without new blades to replace when the time comes</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product which is great not only for use on my back, but also general \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you suffered from the Cro-Mag disease that had you resemble the &amp;#34;missing link&amp;#34; more than a human on the beach, this device is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I used the man groomer and that was alright, but took forever with the smaller head and wasn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought the original BakSpa model and now the new Bigmouth blades.</li>
            <li> But the baKblade really works well!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li> Only suggestion is a bit more curve to its shaft.</li>
            <li> It may be better to hold off purchasing additional blades until you actually need them, unless you can store them in humid-free areas.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think of it first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first blade ..</li>
            <li> First time it takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> We purchased a replacement pack when we originally purchased the bakblade in mid July 2013, my HAIRY husband has used the ORIGINAL RAZOR</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you have to make sure no bumps or back acne because it will go along with the hair and bleed.</li>
            <li> I used the first blade for over a year - probably 2 times per month -</li>
            <li> Outstanding blade,  I would recommend this product to any man who needs to groom their back.</li>
            <li> I got 4 shaves out of my first blade.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip -</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough on how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works great and feels just like a high grade back scratcher (comfortable) but remove hair extremely well!</li>
            <li> It will give you a clean sharp shave, very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The new blades fit in the original handle, and are a big improvement.</li>
            <li> If you have the hairy back problem as most men do, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Two bases for $13 is pretty high, but I&#x27;m willing to pay that for a product that works.</li>
            <li> If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it..  </li>
            <li> There is nothing like the feeling of a freshly shorn back--free of the fur that embarrassed me, made my clothes fit weird...and now, I am like a normal human again, and I can turn in my ape-card.</li>
            <li> They do a great job wet or dry .  </li>
            <li> But after about use three on a new blade, it settles in to almost like a back scratcher and is good for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Great for the bak blade, they don&#x27;t stay sharp for as long as i&#x27;d like them too</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it removed hair with no discomfort, actually with a pleasant feeling of getting your back scratched.</li>
            <li> and i have to say it has been a much needed tool.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Takes only a couple of minutes to get a smooth shave without having to ask for help.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well and they seem very durable.</li>
            <li> This was a real find.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The razor and blades are very well thought out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to change the blade.</li>
            <li> They really shaves close</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> &#x27;ll real</li>
            <li> Thanks baKBlade</li>
            <li> And I really don&#x27;t have to touch up as often as I thought.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly a very durable product and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy beast and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that gives a nice clean look and that I can do myself without missing spots.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s intended shave, but it works, and is probably better and cheaper than other options out there.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use - the change out with the old blades was simple and fast - I recommend.</li>
            <li> for 10-15 good shaves is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Then again they may have a special rust-proof coating I am unaware of.</li>
            <li> They give a much more thorough shave in less time.</li>
            <li> but after multiple uses, it has proven itself worthy of praise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy and the longevity for me has been decent.</li>
            <li> and I have still been unable to injure myself which is pretty remarkable because I can cut myself with any razor.</li>
            <li> (More at my review for the back SPA Big Mouth handle.)&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve find you want to go easy on the first few uses of this thing...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get.</li>
            <li> Unlike normal razor blades, these won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> but I still have to occasionally get fresh ones.  </li>
            <li> Amazing grooming tool for your back, say goodbye to &amp;#34;honey can you please shave my back&amp;#34; The blade is extremely sharp, I won&#x27;t recommend using it without applying shaving cream to your back first.</li>
            <li> After using several products that claimed to be easy to reach the middle of my back...I was resigned to the thought that I&#x27;d be sitting in the window of Mr. Peebles Pet shop for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> I got the replacement blades for the obvious reason and they came quickly and are completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just placed an order for the new 3 pack blade set.</li>
            <li> Priced very reasonable given how well they are built and last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21, have pretty gnarly back hair, and this product removed it with ease.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just have a means to quickly replace the blades in my new shaver, however I have slight concerns regarding them lasting long enough (e.g. not rusting)</li>
            <li> perhaps the best feature is the ease with which I can shave my back; no longer do I need to rely on either other people (which can be awkward) or trying other products that have so many moving parts.  </li>
            <li> Updated design slightly less friction than original.</li>
            <li> Its so large that I can shave my whole back within about 5 minutes, and I only have to replace the blades after about eight uses.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back</li>
            <li> but I still get razor burn no matter how gentle a shave my back.</li>
            <li> and this is only product that I&#x27;ve found that really works.</li>
            <li> confirmed delivery but could not give me the information on who collected it as our office has two buildings adjacent to each other and different people collect packages all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it dry and still on the first blade.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 7 times and STILL does not feel he needs to change the ORIGINAL blade out yet!</li>
            <li> Only back shaving product that really works!</li>
            <li> The blades last a decent while, they&#x27;re a bit pricey but</li>
            <li> I would have been content to pay around $5 total per blade, but the high prices have given me a reason to re-design the cartridge using a 3D printer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy and very hairy back.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few seconds and clean as a whistle.  </li>
            <li> so the blade doesn&#x27;t get wet from shower moisture (even stainless steel rusts).</li>
            <li> You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li> It is so much quicker and easier that other shaving methods or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my whole upper body and did it in half the time it took with electric clippers.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a little high</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about a lot of things, but this Back shaving device really works, it&#x27;s simple to use and very fast with no skin irritation even when dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> It even works pretty well when the blades start to get dull...</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the blades don&#x27;t last very long ..</li>
            <li> The new blades are sharp enough that you have to be a bit careful with them.</li>
            <li> I just hope the blades last long.</li>
            <li> How long the blades will last has yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> Animal\\&quot; Steele, it will not last that long.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I found that if I shave dry the blades last longer and store it in a drawer</li>
            <li> and they last a long long time.</li>
            <li> do!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hair Cutting device will work on most skin types.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it looked really cheap when it showed up</li>
            <li> $7.95 for shipping is absurd - this weighs about 6 ounces and shipping should be $3-$4 tops or even free with Prime</li>
            <li> Personal grooming typically isn&#x27;t the highlight of any given day and cleaning up unwanted hair is one probably on the low end of this process.  </li>
            <li> It has a large cutting head; doesn&#x27;t need batteries or electricity, and works fast.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it with water,  must be used dry.</li>
            <li> Also a word of advice: you will get goose bumps if you shave dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin also and dry shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single cut.  </li>
            <li> Helps to clear ou t clippings with any small brush.</li>
            <li> Works just as well wet or dry</li>
            <li> Removes all hair painlessly, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> the unit is so easy to use is silly!</li>
            <li> I found that I actually got at least double that amount.</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t careful and watch out for your fingers on the hand not holding the shaver, it will do damage if you get too close.</li>
            <li> I only get a few shaves out of the blades though.</li>
            <li> And to think I spent $60 a month on waxing and endured all that pain, plus having to drive 30 minutes each way.  </li>
            <li> I use it wet while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> I hope it sells because I would hate to order more blades only to find out they went out of business.  </li>
            <li> not that it will cut you, but it can leave you feeling a big raw.  </li>
            <li> this replacement blade keeps your Bakblade sharp and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that the blades become dull after 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the blades dull after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades on average have lasted me three-four months with using it 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> In fact, if the baKblade company continues to sell its product &amp; replacement blades with such ridiculous markup, as well as charge additional for shipping, I hope some other company comes along to compete for this market space.</li>
            <li> but once you have it down you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
            <li> DO NOT pull that blade along your skin until the goose bumps go down.</li>
            <li> Like the subject says.</li>
            <li> SO NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> Just so darn expensive for new blades.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tricky to shave the area</li>
            <li> So getting a lot of miles out of each blade, which helps to justify the cost since they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> About every 2 weeks just a little touch up.</li>
            <li> I have used it a dozen different ways and it is impossible to cut myself (so far).</li>
            <li> Keeps me groomed and less shaggy!</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on here that said the blade was dull after 2-5 shaves but this is not my experience.</li>
            <li> expensive and someone is making some big $$ on this gadget.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> no more embarrassment wearing a tank or being shirtless</li>
            <li> Not many company owners do that here in America.  </li>
            <li> and i would suggest these razors to any man that has nasty back hair and wants it gone</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> This thing seriously changed my life.</li>
            <li> Nothing serious or anything that would stop me from using this product over and over.</li>
            <li> $8 extra for shipping is just the manufacturer&#x27;s way of telling you that they think you&#x27;re stupid.</li>
            <li> but it has a small cutting head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> USE.THANKS ALOT ILL</li>
            <li> no risk of cutting myself and cuts close with no shaving cream or even water.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use and tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li> Always pleased with the refills for my baKblade.  Keeps me groomed and less shaggy!</li>
            <li> After using several products that claimed to be easy to reach the middle of my back...I was resigned to the thought that I&#x27;d be sitting in the window of Mr. Peebles Pet shop for the rest of my life.  But the baKblade really works well!  There is nothing like the feeling of a freshly shorn back--free of the fur that embarrassed me, made my clothes fit weird...and now, I am like a normal human again, and I can turn in my ape-card. If you suffered from the Cro-Mag disease that had you resemble the &amp;#34;missing link&amp;#34; more than a human on the beach, this device is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they had something that would clip my tail.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invent something to get rid of my ear-hair.  I can&#x27;t hear too good either.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it. Ive used it several times a week for the last 6 months and i have to say it has been a much needed tool. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT.  Now I can finally do my back by myself.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.  Fast and effective.  Will nick you if you aren&#x27;t careful and watch out for your fingers on the hand not holding the shaver, it will do damage if you get too close.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write  reviews so this product is good enough to make me do it. In 15 minutes , with no pain at all, I shaved everything off . Feeling like a nice light back scratch , it was pleasant and effortless . Perfect results ! Waxing was killing me with pain and I am so happy with this . I highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li> same as the original, the refill works great, and causes no razor bumps or irritation. now I use it on my back, shoulders, neck.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works great for me. Only suggestion is a bit more curve to its shaft.</li>
            <li> Only back shaving product that really works!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews....  Simply put...  If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it..  Just get this,  don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get. This product is great...  Don&#x27;t use it with water,  must be used dry.</li>
            <li> Best product for dudes that have a hairy situation going on. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I purchase these blade on June of 2013. I have yet to have use them because the original blade is still doing its job.</li>
            <li> Have an electric back groomer but it has a small cutting head and it takes for ever to remove hair.  The Bigmouth is great.  It has a large cutting head; doesn&#x27;t need batteries or electricity, and works fast.  I just hope the blades last long.</li>
            <li> Like the subject says. this replacement blade keeps your Bakblade sharp and it gets the job done. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Comes with its own storage pouch.  Nice Design and works amazing.  I am very glad I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just have a means to quickly replace the blades in my new shaver, however I have slight concerns regarding them lasting long enough (e.g. not rusting) before I get a chance to use them.  It may be better to hold off purchasing additional blades until you actually need them, unless you can store them in humid-free areas.  Then again they may have a special rust-proof coating I am unaware of.</li>
            <li> It is great.  I have used it for about 9 months and it is the best invention of the year.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t think of it first.  I hope it sells because I would hate to order more blades only to find out they went out of business.  buy this and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first blade .. Use it twice a week&lt;br /&gt;Unless going out that night then I use it before shower&lt;br /&gt;But love it so much did not want to be without new blades to replace when the time comes</li>
            <li> This product worked AWESOME!!! Guys, if you have a hairy back and need something to remove the hair this is the solution. Takes only a couple of minutes to get a smooth shave without having to ask for help. First time it takes some getting used to but once you have it down you&#x27;ll never use anything else. If you have the hairy back problem as most men do, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In using this blade with the bakblade handle (see my review under this product for a more detailed explanation) I was pleasantly surprised how well it removed hair with no discomfort, actually with a pleasant feeling of getting your back scratched. I had nor worries about scrapes or cuts with the way the blade is designed, and it never snagged or pulled hair. I don&#x27;t know how they designed it but it is a great product and should be used by any guy who wants to remove the hair on their back.</li>
            <li> bakBlade is the best back shaver, PERIOD!  This is the best back shaver ever invented.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anything else</li>
            <li> These blades work very well and they seem very durable. Good price and I should get lots of use out of these replacements. All in all this is a overall good product (The whole set up).</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use - the change out with the old blades was simple and fast - I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for the bak blade, they don&#x27;t stay sharp for as long as i&#x27;d like them too but the bak blade is amazing for do it yourself shaving.</li>
            <li> Decent product, make sure you have adequate mirrors to use</li>
            <li> Had a battery operated one for many years and every tile I used it, I was left with many many cuts and bleeding. This one is very smooth and no cuts so far.</li>
            <li> If you get the rake, you&#x27;ll need replacements.&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive and someone is making some big $$ on this gadget.&lt;br /&gt;But if you count the cost of a back wax, $25?, then this gadget pays for itself in two uses.&lt;br /&gt;Each blade lasts 7-8 uses.Go figure.</li>
            <li> Never bought a back blade before. Finally read all the reviews and decided on this one. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to and don&#x27;t need to. but I&#x27;ll buy this again if I ever need to as it works great with or without gel/cream. Good buy. Stop looking.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works as advertized</li>
            <li> excellent, recommend using in shower.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the original blade they came out with.  It really cleaned easily as well.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Great and they last a long long time. 5 or 6 shaves which is about 5 or 6 months for me.</li>
            <li> What can I say, but WOW. A must have for any man what body hair in undesirable placed. Quick and easy! Also, the merchant baKblade has AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Would definitely recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO EASY ALOT BETTER THAN GETTING WAXED EVERY MONTH. VERY EASY TO USE.THANKS ALOT ILL LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic. Priced very reasonable given how well they are built and last.  They hold up well are the most cost effective way to keep your back hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades on average have lasted me three-four months with using it 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> This was a real find.  I tried all sorts of electric razors that never lasted or worked well.  This is much simpler, faster, cheaper, and works the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever tried without any irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li> I recommend to obtain these blades with the priginal purchase to reduce the cost of your overall shipping.  Highly recommend the shaver.</li>
            <li> We purchased a replacement pack when we originally purchased the bakblade in mid July 2013, my HAIRY husband has used the ORIGINAL RAZOR AT LEAST 7 times and STILL does not feel he needs to change the ORIGINAL blade out yet! He said it still shaves as smooth &amp; close as the 1st use and until it doesn&#x27;t, he sees no point in changing it! Had we went with another similar Shaver, we already would have had to purchase additional disposable razors WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding Product. A Fine Seller who sells Merchandise that does what is advertised to do!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hair Cutting device will work on most skin types. I have been on the lookout for years, just for the&lt;br /&gt;right one. I have several different rechargeable body shavers. None of these cut as close and smooth as&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;BakBlade&amp;#34; Shaver.</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do in the least amount of time. Gotta have my clean look and this take care of matters in the shower in no time</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product. the only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that the blades become dull after 5 shaves. It is still a great buy if you want to get rid of that unwanted back hair. if you buy it you will love it.</li>
            <li> Personal grooming typically isn&#x27;t the highlight of any given day and cleaning up unwanted hair is one probably on the low end of this process.  The bakBlade works well and does the job.  It is so much quicker and easier that other shaving methods or chemicals.  The fact is, it does feel like scratching your back and you&#x27;re done.  This is a high quality product that does what it says; the customer service from bakBlade is excellent as well.  This product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product works great and feels just like a high grade back scratcher (comfortable) but remove hair extremely well! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This works AWESOME! I used it on my whole upper body and did it in half the time it took with electric clippers. How long the blades will last has yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and does job well without any problems. In the past, I have tried many things, but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when you use the blades.  Absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I have recommended it to both family and friends and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> These blades work amazingly well and I have not had a single cut.  The razor and blades are very well thought out. You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li> I bought the original BakSpa model and now the new Bigmouth blades. The new blades fit in the original handle, and are a big improvement. They are much sharper and dont clog as easily. The new blades are sharp enough that you have to be a bit careful with them. They give a much more thorough shave in less time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. However, 12.95 (and 7.95 shipping?!?) for 10-15 good shaves is ridiculous. Check your prices.</li>
            <li> bakBLADE is the best of the bunch--it basically is a big shave blade that cleanly shaves the back,but&lt;br /&gt;you have to make sure no bumps or back acne because it will go along with the hair and bleed. Have&lt;br /&gt;your wife or girl friend navigate the touch areas or get out the ointment and the bandaids!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!!! +++</li>
            <li> The shaver I originally bought was no longer available but this product was even better, trust me@  Would certainly buy again</li>
            <li> The literature states that you should get about seven shaves from a blade. I found that I actually got at least double that amount. Great!</li>
            <li> Good simple quick solution. I get many more uses than some reviewers.  Helps to clear ou t clippings with any small brush. Updated design slightly less friction than original. Good product.</li>
            <li> this razor is the best razor I ever had I totally love it I have a very hairy back and I was able to use this product myself totally love it.</li>
            <li> LOL  I used the first blade for over a year - probably 2 times per month - so 12 shaves total.  Also kept it in the shower many times - never any rust.  Love it.  But it&#x27;s time to upgrade / refresh my blades.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works great. Shipping is a little high but I just order 4 at a time and the shipping is the same.</li>
            <li> Brilliant product. But cost me £56 to ship to uk for one and two spare blades. But product is brill shav&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you set up a uk distributer please!</li>
            <li> Ok. Wish it would last beyond 3-4 uses</li>
            <li> Outstanding blade,  I would recommend this product to any man who needs to groom their back. This is an awesome product.  I used to use a electric man groomer and hands down, this is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Definitely recommended for hairy backs.  Unlike normal razor blades, these won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using it, but it works. It can be a little tricky to shave the area it&#x27;s intended shave, but it works, and is probably better and cheaper than other options out there. I think it&#x27;s worth it for maintaining a beach body.</li>
            <li> This shaver works better than anything I have ever used before. Its so large that I can shave my whole back within about 5 minutes, and I only have to replace the blades after about eight uses. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a life saver no more embarrassment wearing a tank or being shirtless</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found until I can afford to laser it off!</li>
            <li> The blades came when they said it would. I don&#x27;t like that I only get a few shaves out of the blades though.</li>
            <li> The blades are awesome!! The only issue I have is the blades don&#x27;t last very long ..</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was skeptical because it looked really cheap when it showed up but after multiple uses, it has proven itself worthy of praise. If you are a body builder doing shows or just want to avoid the mohair carpet back, this unit is for you. I have used it a dozen different ways and it is impossible to cut myself (so far). I&#x27;m have fairly sparse back hair and I have used this until about 20 time and it&#x27;s still sharp. I took off one star for the cost of shipping. $7.95 for shipping is absurd - this weighs about 6 ounces and shipping should be $3-$4 tops or even free with Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 months post purchase. I use this about 3 times a week. I&#x27;m ready to change the blade. I&#x27;m not a hairy guy and the longevity for me has been decent. But if you are like George \\&quot;The Animal\\&quot; Steele, it will not last that long. This is a versatile shaver and I have still been unable to injure myself which is pretty remarkable because I can cut myself with any razor. I&#x27;m still irritated by the shipping cost on these products and I&#x27;ve been purposely putting off a blade reorder.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Top Notch Seller</li>
            <li> It arrived today - quick shipping!  I used it and I have to say this product is a MUST!  Works as advertised!  I used it dry, no shaving cream or anything - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the bakblade for several months now.  Flawless performance.  Only takes a few seconds and clean as a whistle.  And to think I spent $60 a month on waxing and endured all that pain, plus having to drive 30 minutes each way.  This is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Lasts for a good long while.  I&#x27;ve find you want to go easy on the first few uses of this thing...not that it will cut you, but it can leave you feeling a big raw.  But after about use three on a new blade, it settles in to almost like a back scratcher and is good for several weeks.  Update on 18 June: I&#x27;m just now putting on the second blade of my two blade replacement pack. So getting a lot of miles out of each blade, which helps to justify the cost since they are a little pricey. But they sure do work!  I&#x27;m a hairy beast and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that gives a nice clean look and that I can do myself without missing spots.   I&#x27;ve just placed an order for the new 3 pack blade set. Shipping is kinda high, esp since I&#x27;m used to getting it free with prime. But the shipping was the same for 3 as it was 2, so might as well save where you can.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. A product that delivers on its promise. Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing seriously changed my life. The blades last a decent while, they&#x27;re a bit pricey but certainly worth it as they really do a great job. With this, I&#x27;m able to clean my back up quickly and efficiently. Water and shaving cream are a must, however.</li>
            <li> A great product.  Works perfectly! !</li>
            <li> They really shaves close and i would suggest these razors to any man that has nasty back hair and wants it gone</li>
            <li> Works great! Extremely happy with this product, easy to use and lasts me quite awhile before having to order more. I&#x27;m very happy with bakblade!</li>
            <li> Great blades but I still get razor burn no matter how gentle a shave my back. The company says you shave without cream.</li>
            <li> Great replacement razors for perfect back hair removal product</li>
            <li> I got 4 shaves out of my first blade. I only shave every couple of months. I&#x27;m a big guy and very hairy back. Probably would get more uses from blade if you shave while hair is shorter. This thing is awesome. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;ve tried all the options out there and this is only product that I&#x27;ve found that really works. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use to pay my son 5 dollars to shave my back. He&#x27;s grown up now and doesn&#x27;t want to do it any more. I would beg my wife to do it but she hates it. So I ordered one and I recieved  it in the mail today. I tried it and it worked great!. I&#x27;m so excited that I can do it myself and not have to depend on some body else. Great product and I will tell my hairy back friends.</li>
            <li> As always, baKblade makes great products!  I use it once per week and it&#x27;s quick and easy and shaves very close!  It even works pretty well when the blades start to get dull...but I still have to occasionally get fresh ones.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and I can reach all areas of my back.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Tried everything including waxing, the Bakblade works the best and it&#x27;s also the fastest. Works just as well wet or dry</li>
            <li> If you buy a baKBlade back shaver, you must get extra blades. Just get the blades and that way you don&#x27;t have to think about it for several months.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent. Dose the job brilliantly. I will sure to be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> Since I do not have the product yet, I cannot comment on the product, however, I would like to say that Matt seems like a fantastic person.&lt;br /&gt;There was a delivery issue from USPS and I wrote a feedback on Amazon that I did not receive the product and I was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;However, tracking number showed it is delivered. I called USPS and USPS confirmed delivery but could not give me the information on who collected it as our office has two buildings adjacent to each other and different people collect packages all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, I got a call from Matt, he said he wants to send me one more bakBalde via fedex 1-day priority the moment he saw my feedback. Also, earlier, I had canceled my order and initiated a refund assuming product was not delivered. But Matt wasn&#x27;t too worried about the money and said he wants me to have the product and make sure I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen this type of a customer service in many products that we buy these days.&lt;br /&gt;Once I receive the product tomorrow I will be go ahead and purchase one more just to make sure, I dont get this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I can only rate the customer service and it is definitely excellent!</li>
            <li> I love my baKblade (all except for the squirrelly capitalization) and am very happy with it. I got the replacement blades for the obvious reason and they came quickly and are completely satisfactory. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Had it for a couple months now. Never let&#x27;s me down. I use it every other day.  I use it dry and still on the first blade. The only regret I have about the product is that I should a had one years ago. It&#x27;s a god send for a man with a hairy back and a wife or girlfriend who fe fuses yo shave it. Buy Asap!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and even better experience with the Product !  This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip - the unit is so easy to use is silly! No water no foam needed ! It works fantastic!!  Very pleased with purchase I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used the man groomer and that was alright, but took forever with the smaller head and wasn&#x27;t very smooth. These no BS I can shave my back in 1 minute just starting with it and as soon as you put a shirt on you&#x27;ll real how smooth a shave it is. I have sensitive skin also and dry shave with very little irritation. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t last very long. I am going back the Men&#x27;s Groomer</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on your dongles but it appears to work on frontside as well as it does on backside. seems that im just keep covering more and more territory. Thanks baKBlade</li>
            <li> Amazing grooming tool for your back, say goodbye to &amp;#34;honey can you please shave my back&amp;#34; The blade is extremely sharp, I won&#x27;t recommend using it without applying shaving cream to your back first. It will give you a clean sharp shave, very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price! Must have for any man looking to be well groomed during the summer months!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t praise this product enough.  Easy to install and use.  Hands down, THE best back groomer out there - and I&#x27;ve used them all.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My only issue is the blades dull after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Incredibly easy to use and does the job well. Simplicity of design is brillant. I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Love the product and would love it more if they could put a soap strip on it, similar to the Intuition razor although I realize that is a trademarked product. Has to be a way to do it so you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough on how much I love this product.  For the amount of hair I had on my back these blades remove it all.  And I really don&#x27;t have to touch up as often as I thought.  About every 2 weeks just a little touch up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about a lot of things, but this Back shaving device really works, it&#x27;s simple to use and very fast with no skin irritation even when dry shaving.  BIGMOUTH BakBlade is the way to go if you&#x27;re not gonna pay the big bucks for laser and with its ease of use I don&#x27;t mind shaving with it once or twice per week.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but effective! (The blades are pricey PLUS, you have to pay extra for shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, but not the pricing. In fact, if the baKblade company continues to sell its product &amp; replacement blades with such ridiculous markup, as well as charge additional for shipping, I hope some other company comes along to compete for this market space.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said this product is garbage. SO NOT TRUE. I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!! I had some issues with the local post office here so I contacted bakblade and the owner responded. He was awesome. He stayed in contact with me until I received my purchase. Not many company owners do that here in America.  That should say a lot about a guy. He didn&#x27;t have to do anything because it wasn&#x27;t his fault but he when out of his way to help me. For that I am thankful. Bakblade works better than I thought. Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher. Removes all hair painlessly, wet or dry. I use it wet while I&#x27;m in the shower. My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding. Nothing serious or anything that would stop me from using this product over and over. I LOVE IT!!! Great product and an even better owner.</li>
            <li> Works great going to buy more</li>
            <li> Love the back blade and this is a great deal for the blades. I read a few reviews on here that said the blade was dull after 2-5 shaves but this is not my experience. I shave 2 to 3 times a week and I use these blades for about a month each. I found that if I shave dry the blades last longer and store it in a drawer so the blade doesn&#x27;t get wet from shower moisture (even stainless steel rusts). Also a word of advice: you will get goose bumps if you shave dry. DO NOT pull that blade along your skin until the goose bumps go down. It will tear you up.</li>
            <li> They do a great job wet or dry .  Does a much better job then the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Love the Bigmouth device and the blades do really well. Just so darn expensive for new blades. Plus, shipping is up there too.</li>
            <li> Great way to shave your back.  Works well, no risk of cutting myself and cuts close with no shaving cream or even water.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product came as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Must have if you have a forrest growing on your back.</li>
            <li> These work incredibly  well - A big surprise at how well. (More at my review for the back SPA Big Mouth handle.)&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Bought along with the Bigmouth do it yourself back hair shaver.. says he loves it</li>
            <li> Two bases for $13 is pretty high, but I&#x27;m willing to pay that for a product that works. $8 extra for shipping is just the manufacturer&#x27;s way of telling you that they think you&#x27;re stupid. I would have been content to pay around $5 total per blade, but the high prices have given me a reason to re-design the cartridge using a 3D printer. I can now re-load the cartridge with my own safety razor blades.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! You get many uses out of each blade and it works SO MUCH BETTER than any razor and shaving cream combo. I&#x27;m 21, have pretty gnarly back hair, and this product removed it with ease.    I absolutely LOVE this product which is great not only for use on my back, but also general \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly a very durable product and perhaps the best feature is the ease with which I can shave my back; no longer do I need to rely on either other people (which can be awkward) or trying other products that have so many moving parts.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and look forward to using it in the future.</li>
