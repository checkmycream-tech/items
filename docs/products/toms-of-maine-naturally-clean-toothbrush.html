    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s is the best!</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a really awesome nature material brush</li>
            <li>So, I was happy to find this.</li>
            <li>These are great no colors.</li>
            <li>On the surface great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice grip on the handle which perfectly conforms to your thumb and fingers.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This brush is great.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush without all of the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>toothbrush feels good.</li>
            <li>Hippos probably need a good brushing once in a while...</li>
            <li>It is superior in every way to the Oral B toothbrush that it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be some hippie unusable toothbrush, but it turned out to be surprisingly practical.</li>
            <li>It has an angled neck, ergonomic with multi-height bristles that are designed for good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I suspect you could do more good by buying a cheaper toothbrush and donating the difference to a good environmental cause.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>The reality seems to be, buy this for the effective design, but not to be a conscientious consumer.</li>

            <li>This is a nice toothbrush</li>
            <li>I also love it because it is ecology-friendly; the package tells all the good things about it</li>
            <li>Of course that was a completely adequate, and even very good toothbrush, but this is a better one.</li>
            <li>Teeth are very important and should be given much more credit than we give them, and they should be taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has very nice tight bristles, a very good ergonomic handle, and is not neon colored.  </li>
            <li>Things I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles take more getting used to.  </li>
            <li>(The castor oil plant is also the source of the dreaded toxin Ricin, though I&#x27;m fairly confident they&#x27;ve worked out that kink, since you place this thing in your mouth every day.)  </li>
            <li>I gave 2 stars rather than more for this reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of an Oral-B fan.</li>
            <li>I want to start my review by saying that I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for deodorant for a year or so, and have always bought their product because I think that their company is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, but do a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>But if it makes you feel better, by all means go for it.</li>
            <li>- wait is this an Olympic sport?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots and lots of toothbrushes out there, and there&#x27;s nothing magical about this one.</li>
            <li>I like that it is more sustainable, dye-free, and plant based.  </li>
            <li>Much better then 99% of the brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>All in all, satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>My grandmother lived in Maine for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I found Tom&#x27;s and learned that a toothbrush is not just a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush because it has bristles of assorted sizes; I prefer those type of toothbrushes over the ones that have all one even size.  </li>
            <li>love toothbrushes and dental products.  </li>
            <li>I think our teeth do so much more for us than we give them credit for:  </li>
            <li>I think maybe they&#x27;re closer together than the Preserve bristles--they seem to get food caught in them more easily.  </li>
            <li>I think the head is way too big(comparing it to an Oral-B 60, which is huge) in length, --you&#x27;ll clean your teeth more effectively with</li>
            <li>I got a light blue and it fits wonderfully in my hand and reaches all of my wisdom</li>
            <li>I love for my teeth to be clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love clean and healthy</li>
            <li>Other wise a really good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Flimsy, best to just go outdoors, pick a stem from a tree- pound it down and brush your teeth with that.</li>
            <li>This is a fine, well-designed toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is light weight and has a grip and shape that makes it easy to get to all portions of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>a smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great and has a really comfortable grip so all in all if you choose not to use a power toothbrush (which is the way to go)</li>
            <li>Works as great as a regular toothbrush but has the advantage of being made by recyclable materials.  </li>
            <li>this is nice brush with a reasonable price</li>
            <li>With the attention that&#x27;s been given to BPA, the concerns and the change in a lot of baby and kid products, I never thought about whether the toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used and continue to use are BPA free.</li>
            <li>and that just wouldn&#x27;t fit in the space on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap Kroger brush has those too.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush, the bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh, which is good because I have sensitive gums which can bleed with stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and my mouth feels good after using it.</li>
            <li>Again, if you have sensitive gums or gum recession, this will probably be good for you.</li>
            <li>By far the best tooth brush I have used, doesn&#x27;t go flat after a months time like most.</li>
            <li>I like that the materials are recycled and the color is very nice, too (I got a light blue).  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold and since it has no rubbery grip, it stays clean.</li>
            <li>It definitely is a very soft toothbrush and gentle on my gums, but I don&#x27;t think it did a great job of cleaning...</li>
            <li>Twigs and even porcupine quills were logical go-to tools for the ancients, and bristle toothbrushes were in use 1600 B.C., but the toothbrush went into mass production in 1780; the brainchild of a prisoner who cobbled one together in his cell and went on to become a wealthy businessman.  </li>
            <li>It helps to be backed by the Tom&#x27;s of Maine namebrand as we are all familiar with the company producing quality eco-friendly products.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable handle and soft, but effective bristles.  </li>
            <li>every one that I tried never got my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine wants you to enjoy a time-tested toothbrush design in a slightly more eco-friendy package (recyclable petroleum-free handle, dye-free bristles...).</li>
            <li>The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Bristle Toothbrush is a nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush as far as toothbrushes go.</li>
            <li>The overall shape of them is good for brushing the fronts of teeth, but the curve in their arrangement gets in my way a bit when doing sides or backs of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So companies are now offering more responsible, renewable alternatives as this one by Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job and is a good solid toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Nice to know it is made with natural materials.</li>
            <li>I can buy 2 premium brand toothbrushes with plastic handles for the price of one of these, and I&#x27;d feel just as good about all the little animals - and even better about the plants.</li>
            <li>There was also a flat spot on the handle for my thumb, which coupled with the flexibility of the handle made it fairly ergonomic.</li>
            <li>Good product that would be a perfect substitute for commercial brands that are less healthy and produce more waste.</li>
            <li>I will say they make a good, toothbrush that really does have soft bristles adn</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush; highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth just fine, the most important aspect of the process being the time and care I put into brushing, not necessarily the brush</li>
            <li>The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbrush does its job OK.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very satisfactory and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li>Nice simple toothbrush.</li>
            <li>like that there are no artificial colors,</li>
            <li>The plant-based plastic handle, no artificial colors and so on.</li>
            <li>but the brush is nice and big, so it reaches a lot of your teeth when you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>so I liked it enough.</li>
            <li>A toothbrush is a toothbrush, right?  </li>
            <li>Really nice quality I expected it to wear out quick</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s toothpastes (non-fluoride) and deodorants and trust the brand in general.  </li>
            <li>Now, with 50 million pounds of them tossed into American landfills each year, it seems ecologically prudent to offer a solution to a huge plastics problem.  </li>
            <li>the gasoline burned by delivery trucks and related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?  </li>
            <li>I ordered the toothbrush, and found it to be a very worth competitor with those available in my local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush very much with</li>
            <li>But in reality, only the most dedicated consumers are going to separate, store, box and ship as described.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t exactly know what a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle would be in a toothbrush</li>
            <li>To be honest though, it isn&#x27;t much different from the basic toothbrushes that dentists hand out for free.</li>
            <li>im still undecided if id buy this one on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li>But if you like the idea of a green toothbrush, or you are a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, or if you find it at a good price...</li>
            <li>Other more realistic choices are now available for that.nd related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?  </li>
            <li>Other more realistic choices are now available for that.</li>
            <li>I used this toothbrush for a couple more weeks after this review, and I found that the bristles wore out very quickly, and that by the 3rd week, I needed to brush my teeth again by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li>B001LFF31Y Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush 4 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and leave the mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbruth.  </li>
            <li>It is hippie enough, both the toothbrush and the packaging are 100% recyclable, the toothbrush is plant based, BPA free with no artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothbrush has a rather unusual shape, but it is surprisingly practical, especially when getting to some of the angles needed to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>But they get soft and mushy quick.</li>
            <li>The handle was also flexible...and thus would give a little during use, which is a feature that I liked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much greener than the mass-produce</li>
            <li>The way my teeth and gums feel after brushing - very</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>The recycle feature, however well intentioned, is perhaps impractical in the real world.</li>
            <li>I think that if you are concerned about having a sustainable toothbrush then absolutely go for this, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my toothbrushes and this one stands up to the challenge.</li>
            <li>Even so, i think the $5-$6 price tag is a bit much, jury still out on that.</li>
            <li>I also get free toothbrushes from my dentist, but in between those visits, I&#x27;d definitely reach for a Tom&#x27;s bio-plastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>change out my toothbrush very often; that&#x27;s what we are suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>I am usually skeptical about eco friendly products, especially when they are made of plastic, but this is a very good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth well without being super fancy- and is a good over all shape and flexible enough to keep you from brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>My first impression upon opening this package was: Oh, great, another weird, uneven-bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li>B002YXXZQM Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full Head, Soft Toothbrush, 4-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This brand is slightly better compared this with my regular Oral B toothbrush (soft), but this is also a little more pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothbrush is lightweight and the the soft bristles are very gentle and for me, it felt like I was using a child&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that they had a toothbrush option that was 100% recyclable right down to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>typically labeled \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and the handle is more flexible than the petroleum based plastics.</li>
            <li>sorry Tom&#x27;s!I still love your company :)</li>
            <li>but if it holds out for a decent period of time, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>(I use a high flouride toothpaste I buy from my dentist).</li>
            <li>As far as toothbrushes go, this one is nice and soft and won&#x27;t rip up your gums if they are sensitive, like some of the other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>packaging is all right, although mine came with quite a bit of tape on it, which made it harder to open and probably not as easy to recycle.  </li>
            <li>Is that worth a couple of extra bucks?</li>
            <li>This is THE tootbrush for the eco-warrior who cares about the planet so much, they are willing to pay extra for a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t harmful to the planet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is BPA free which is a huge plus, the bristles are soft and I like the different heights on it which allows you reach all the uneven spaces between your teeth.</li>
            <li>far as recycling the brush feel free to use Tom&#x27;s Terracycle system though why anyone would pay money to recycle a toothbrush is beyond me ( great program for other difficult recyclables though) just toss it in with your normal plastic recyclables.</li>
            <li>The handle uses less material than most other toothbrushes I have seen, so it is more flat, to the point where it looks rather unusual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you want a new toothbrush, this is what i recommend...</li>
            <li>for how it feels, it feels just like other soft toothbrushes, and the bristles do not pull out easily like in dollar store toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush is advertised as Soft, but in my experience, after a few weeks of intermittent usage, it feels more of a Soft to Medium.</li>
            <li>I realize that &#x27;clean enough&#x27; is definitely the perception of the user, and for all</li>
            <li>but so far after a month of continuous use it still looks and feels like it is new.</li>
            <li>I get a new one every 2 months and use the old ones for trips and discard them before heading home.</li>
            <li>applaud Tom&#x27;s for placing a worthy bio-plastic product that can actually compete against the traditional plastic items.  </li>
            <li>I generally prefer the straight, simple, classic design.</li>
            <li>If you use soft toothbrushes, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li>It is not even close to soft.</li>
            <li>but so far I still prefer Preserve toothbrushes as an eco-friendly dental health choice.</li>
            <li>too soft.</li>
            <li>The brush head is smallish and maneuverable and the bristles are soft which dentists recommend.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me that I should use a soft toothbrush but</li>
            <li>and I like Soft.</li>
            <li>I brush with baking soda, so I need a soft brush to let the baking soda do all the work.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the soft version of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is slim and easy to hold in even small hands.</li>
            <li>And it was still soft enough for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is very lightweight, almost slipping out of my hand.</li>
            <li>But it is soft enough for me</li>
            <li>B0054J2GVS Reach Total Care Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>The soft is a little more stiff than those</li>
            <li>Simple bristles stand up to several weeks still looking new.</li>
            <li>have used this toothbrush for close to week now, and I usually end up brushing my teeth again because they don&#x27;t feel clean enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are also dye-free (as stated on the box) which makes me wonder, how much dye has been used (if any) in other toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a standard, no-frills toothbrush, comparable to what you&#x27;d get from a major brand like Oral-B at a lower price.</li>
            <li>A dollar or a dollar and a half is a small price to pay, twice a year, to encourage the development of more petroleum plastic alternatives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not really soft enough to be considered a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The head is narrow but normal length, wonderfully soft for my gums and scrubs the plaque away.  </li>
            <li>I got a pretty, translucent pale blue color.  </li>
            <li>I -only- use soft bristled brushes) and it&#x27;s not soft!  </li>

            <li> - wait is this an Olympic sport?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots and lots of toothbrushes out there, and there&#x27;s nothing magical about this one.</li>
            <li> I like that it is more sustainable, dye-free, and plant based.  </li>
            <li> Much better then 99% of the brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> All in all, satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My grandmother lived in Maine for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I found Tom&#x27;s and learned that a toothbrush is not just a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush because it has bristles of assorted sizes; I prefer those type of toothbrushes over the ones that have all one even size.  </li>
            <li> love toothbrushes and dental products.  </li>
            <li> I think our teeth do so much more for us than we give them credit for:  </li>
            <li> I think maybe they&#x27;re closer together than the Preserve bristles--they seem to get food caught in them more easily.  </li>
            <li> I think the head is way too big(comparing it to an Oral-B 60, which is huge) in length, --you&#x27;ll clean your teeth more effectively with</li>
            <li> I got a light blue and it fits wonderfully in my hand and reaches all of my wisdom</li>
            <li> I love for my teeth to be clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Other wise a really good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, best to just go outdoors, pick a stem from a tree- pound it down and brush your teeth with that.</li>
            <li> This is a fine, well-designed toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is light weight and has a grip and shape that makes it easy to get to all portions of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> a smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great and has a really comfortable grip so all in all if you choose not to use a power toothbrush (which is the way to go)</li>
            <li> Works as great as a regular toothbrush but has the advantage of being made by recyclable materials.  </li>
            <li> this is nice brush with a reasonable price</li>
            <li> With the attention that&#x27;s been given to BPA, the concerns and the change in a lot of baby and kid products, I never thought about whether the toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used and continue to use are BPA free.</li>
            <li> and that just wouldn&#x27;t fit in the space on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheap Kroger brush has those too.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush, the bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh, which is good because I have sensitive gums which can bleed with stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, and my mouth feels good after using it.</li>
            <li> Again, if you have sensitive gums or gum recession, this will probably be good for you.</li>
            <li> By far the best tooth brush I have used, doesn&#x27;t go flat after a months time like most.</li>
            <li> I like that the materials are recycled and the color is very nice, too (I got a light blue).  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to hold and since it has no rubbery grip, it stays clean.</li>
            <li> It definitely is a very soft toothbrush and gentle on my gums, but I don&#x27;t think it did a great job of cleaning...</li>
            <li> Twigs and even porcupine quills were logical go-to tools for the ancients, and bristle toothbrushes were in use 1600 B.C., but the toothbrush went into mass production in 1780; the brainchild of a prisoner who cobbled one together in his cell and went on to become a wealthy businessman.  </li>
            <li> It helps to be backed by the Tom&#x27;s of Maine namebrand as we are all familiar with the company producing quality eco-friendly products.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable handle and soft, but effective bristles.  </li>
            <li> every one that I tried never got my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine wants you to enjoy a time-tested toothbrush design in a slightly more eco-friendy package (recyclable petroleum-free handle, dye-free bristles...).</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Bristle Toothbrush is a nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush as far as toothbrushes go.</li>
            <li> The overall shape of them is good for brushing the fronts of teeth, but the curve in their arrangement gets in my way a bit when doing sides or backs of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So companies are now offering more responsible, renewable alternatives as this one by Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and is a good solid toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Nice to know it is made with natural materials.</li>
            <li> I can buy 2 premium brand toothbrushes with plastic handles for the price of one of these, and I&#x27;d feel just as good about all the little animals - and even better about the plants.</li>
            <li> There was also a flat spot on the handle for my thumb, which coupled with the flexibility of the handle made it fairly ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Good product that would be a perfect substitute for commercial brands that are less healthy and produce more waste.</li>
            <li> I will say they make a good, toothbrush that really does have soft bristles adn</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth just fine, the most important aspect of the process being the time and care I put into brushing, not necessarily the brush</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbrush does its job OK.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very satisfactory and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> Nice simple toothbrush.</li>
            <li> like that there are no artificial colors,</li>
            <li> The plant-based plastic handle, no artificial colors and so on.</li>
            <li> but the brush is nice and big, so it reaches a lot of your teeth when you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> so I liked it enough.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush is a toothbrush, right?  </li>
            <li> Really nice quality I expected it to wear out quick</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s toothpastes (non-fluoride) and deodorants and trust the brand in general.  </li>
            <li> Now, with 50 million pounds of them tossed into American landfills each year, it seems ecologically prudent to offer a solution to a huge plastics problem.  </li>
            <li> the gasoline burned by delivery trucks and related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?  </li>
            <li> I ordered the toothbrush, and found it to be a very worth competitor with those available in my local grocery store.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush very much with</li>
            <li> But in reality, only the most dedicated consumers are going to separate, store, box and ship as described.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t exactly know what a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle would be in a toothbrush</li>
            <li> To be honest though, it isn&#x27;t much different from the basic toothbrushes that dentists hand out for free.</li>
            <li> im still undecided if id buy this one on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> But if you like the idea of a green toothbrush, or you are a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, or if you find it at a good price...</li>
            <li> Other more realistic choices are now available for that.nd related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?  </li>
            <li> Other more realistic choices are now available for that.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush for a couple more weeks after this review, and I found that the bristles wore out very quickly, and that by the 3rd week, I needed to brush my teeth again by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> B001LFF31Y Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush 4 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and leave the mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbruth.  </li>
            <li> It is hippie enough, both the toothbrush and the packaging are 100% recyclable, the toothbrush is plant based, BPA free with no artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrush has a rather unusual shape, but it is surprisingly practical, especially when getting to some of the angles needed to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> But they get soft and mushy quick.</li>
            <li> The handle was also flexible...and thus would give a little during use, which is a feature that I liked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much greener than the mass-produce</li>
            <li> The way my teeth and gums feel after brushing - very</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li> The recycle feature, however well intentioned, is perhaps impractical in the real world.</li>
            <li> I think that if you are concerned about having a sustainable toothbrush then absolutely go for this, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my toothbrushes and this one stands up to the challenge.</li>
            <li> Even so, i think the $5-$6 price tag is a bit much, jury still out on that.</li>
            <li> I also get free toothbrushes from my dentist, but in between those visits, I&#x27;d definitely reach for a Tom&#x27;s bio-plastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> change out my toothbrush very often; that&#x27;s what we are suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about eco friendly products, especially when they are made of plastic, but this is a very good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth well without being super fancy- and is a good over all shape and flexible enough to keep you from brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> My first impression upon opening this package was: Oh, great, another weird, uneven-bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li> B002YXXZQM Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full Head, Soft Toothbrush, 4-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This brand is slightly better compared this with my regular Oral B toothbrush (soft), but this is also a little more pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrush is lightweight and the the soft bristles are very gentle and for me, it felt like I was using a child&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that they had a toothbrush option that was 100% recyclable right down to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> typically labeled \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and the handle is more flexible than the petroleum based plastics.</li>
            <li> sorry Tom&#x27;s!I still love your company :)</li>
            <li> but if it holds out for a decent period of time, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> (I use a high flouride toothpaste I buy from my dentist).</li>
            <li> As far as toothbrushes go, this one is nice and soft and won&#x27;t rip up your gums if they are sensitive, like some of the other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> packaging is all right, although mine came with quite a bit of tape on it, which made it harder to open and probably not as easy to recycle.  </li>
            <li> Is that worth a couple of extra bucks?</li>
            <li> This is THE tootbrush for the eco-warrior who cares about the planet so much, they are willing to pay extra for a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t harmful to the planet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is BPA free which is a huge plus, the bristles are soft and I like the different heights on it which allows you reach all the uneven spaces between your teeth.</li>
            <li> far as recycling the brush feel free to use Tom&#x27;s Terracycle system though why anyone would pay money to recycle a toothbrush is beyond me ( great program for other difficult recyclables though) just toss it in with your normal plastic recyclables.</li>
            <li> The handle uses less material than most other toothbrushes I have seen, so it is more flat, to the point where it looks rather unusual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you want a new toothbrush, this is what i recommend...</li>
            <li> for how it feels, it feels just like other soft toothbrushes, and the bristles do not pull out easily like in dollar store toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrush is advertised as Soft, but in my experience, after a few weeks of intermittent usage, it feels more of a Soft to Medium.</li>
            <li> I realize that &#x27;clean enough&#x27; is definitely the perception of the user, and for all</li>
            <li> but so far after a month of continuous use it still looks and feels like it is new.</li>
            <li> I get a new one every 2 months and use the old ones for trips and discard them before heading home.</li>
            <li> applaud Tom&#x27;s for placing a worthy bio-plastic product that can actually compete against the traditional plastic items.  </li>
            <li> I generally prefer the straight, simple, classic design.</li>
            <li> If you use soft toothbrushes, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> It is not even close to soft.</li>
            <li> but so far I still prefer Preserve toothbrushes as an eco-friendly dental health choice.</li>
            <li> too soft.</li>
            <li> The brush head is smallish and maneuverable and the bristles are soft which dentists recommend.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I should use a soft toothbrush but</li>
            <li> and I like Soft.</li>
            <li> I brush with baking soda, so I need a soft brush to let the baking soda do all the work.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the soft version of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The handle is slim and easy to hold in even small hands.</li>
            <li> And it was still soft enough for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is very lightweight, almost slipping out of my hand.</li>
            <li> But it is soft enough for me</li>
            <li> B0054J2GVS Reach Total Care Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> The soft is a little more stiff than those</li>
            <li> Simple bristles stand up to several weeks still looking new.</li>
            <li> have used this toothbrush for close to week now, and I usually end up brushing my teeth again because they don&#x27;t feel clean enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are also dye-free (as stated on the box) which makes me wonder, how much dye has been used (if any) in other toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a standard, no-frills toothbrush, comparable to what you&#x27;d get from a major brand like Oral-B at a lower price.</li>
            <li> A dollar or a dollar and a half is a small price to pay, twice a year, to encourage the development of more petroleum plastic alternatives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not really soft enough to be considered a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The head is narrow but normal length, wonderfully soft for my gums and scrubs the plaque away.  </li>
            <li> I got a pretty, translucent pale blue color.  </li>
            <li> I -only- use soft bristled brushes) and it&#x27;s not soft!  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high.</li>
            <li> Used it for about a month now, still in tact, time will tell how long it will last</li>
            <li> If only it included an envelope to mail it back to be recycled with, like some other brands do, it would make this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as soft as Colgate or oral b.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what the package said, though, this is NOT a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No real special shape, indicator, or anything of the such.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other brushes have to have bulky multi layered handles and 4 different bristle heights.</li>
            <li> Big bonus that they use renewable plant sources for the handle, so wasting less plastic.  </li>
            <li> A little simple in design...</li>
            <li> It has a ridge and it makes a splatter if you don&#x27;t have your mouth closed.</li>
            <li> Second, that process itself produces cardboard, paper and plastic bag waste.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of some of Tom of Maine&#x27;s non-toxic mouthwashes and toothpastes, so I was curious to see what they would do with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to hate this this toothbrush assuming it had natural hollow bristels which it doesn&#x27;t as a matter of fact there isn&#x27;t much that&#x27;s natural or green about it.</li>
            <li> teeth way in the tight, tight back.  </li>
            <li> I guess plastic - which 99% of the other toothbrushes are made from - is made from</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted that this is an eco-friendly product, and if this means something to you then this toothbrush would be your choice.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth well and works as well as any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> very hard bristles and the shape of the handle is such that it doesn&#x27;t sit flat, meaning that when you put toothpaste on it, it falls over and makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and the tooth brush are supposed to be totally recyclable, but not in all areas at least not the plastic parts.</li>
            <li> My only complaint: Why this Tom&#x27;s of MAINE product not made in Maine like all their toothpastes, deodorants, soaps, etc.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as I gave it a try, I found the protruding bristles managed to get down into those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a typical toothbrush, just greener and healthier for you.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is thin in general: handle and the part with the bristles, I like them wider.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little softer.</li>
            <li> handle is a little bit bendy, which threw me for a loop</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes a lot of Green claims about its toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The humble toothbrush has been around longer than you might expect.</li>
            <li> The stiff bristles made my gums bleed quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m not sure of the reason for a plant-based handle.</li>
            <li> He can use it even though he is small.</li>
            <li> Somewhere in recent history, to be distinguished from competitors, they started growing neon fins, angled heads and brush designs to produce shock and awe to dazed consumers standing slack-jawed at the dizzying selection in the oral hygiene aisle at Target.  </li>
            <li> It would be horrible to not have teeth, or to not have healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li> And I was surprised that it had some firmness underneath, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be wimpy since it is so eco-friendly, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The exaggerated curvature of the handle looks funky but fits well in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the head of the brush awkwardly shaped.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make a kids size.</li>
            <li> but that all get bad reviews..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine has created a toothbrush for vegans. The handle is made of 99% plant material. I guess plastic - which 99% of the other toothbrushes are made from - is made from animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush feels good. It&#x27;s soft, and my mouth feels good after using it. The price is a little high. The manufacturing process is likely the culprit for that. That being said, I&#x27;m not sure of the reason for a plant-based handle. I can buy 2 premium brand toothbrushes with plastic handles for the price of one of these, and I&#x27;d feel just as good about all the little animals - and even better about the plants.</li>
            <li> Things I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Made in Switzerland, not China!&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s much greener than the mass-produce toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;- The way my teeth and gums feel after brushing - very clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This toothbrush is thin in general: handle and the part with the bristles, I like them wider.</li>
            <li> very hard bristles and the shape of the handle is such that it doesn&#x27;t sit flat, meaning that when you put toothpaste on it, it falls over and makes a mess.  would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I find the head of the brush awkwardly shaped. It has a ridge and it makes a splatter if you don&#x27;t have your mouth closed. It&#x27;s also not really soft enough to be considered a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very satisfactory and easy to hold. Big bonus that they use renewable plant sources for the handle, so wasting less plastic.  It states no dyes on bristles, and I&#x27;ve noticed color come off some brand&#x27;s bristles which makes me think its flaking off in your mouth, gross. So, that is a big plus. I gave this to my son since it seems like a healthier choice. He can use it even though he is small. Good product that would be a perfect substitute for commercial brands that are less healthy and produce more waste.</li>
            <li> Nice simple toothbrush. I don&#x27;t know why other brushes have to have bulky multi layered handles and 4 different bristle heights. Something about toothbrush bloat irks me. So, I was happy to find this. It is just a simple toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you use soft toothbrushes, don&#x27;t buy this one. It is not even close to soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! WIll be buying again!</li>
            <li> Flimsy, best to just go outdoors, pick a stem from a tree- pound it down and brush your teeth with that.</li>
            <li> These are great no colors. But they get soft and mushy quick.</li>
            <li> Works as great as a regular toothbrush but has the advantage of being made by recyclable materials.  Why not?  Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> This was a well made toothbrush. A little simple in design...but I have no problems with that. The handle was also flexible...and thus would give a little during use, which is a feature that I liked. There was also a flat spot on the handle for my thumb, which coupled with the flexibility of the handle made it fairly ergonomic.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbrush does its job OK.  I got a pretty, translucent pale blue color.  The handle shape takes a bit of getting used to because it&#x27;s so different from that of the Preserve toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using for years.  The bristles take more getting used to.  I think maybe they&#x27;re closer together than the Preserve bristles--they seem to get food caught in them more easily.  The overall shape of them is good for brushing the fronts of teeth, but the curve in their arrangement gets in my way a bit when doing sides or backs of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is all right, although mine came with quite a bit of tape on it, which made it harder to open and probably not as easy to recycle.  The toothbrush itself has the recycling symbol that the Preserve toothbrushes lack, which means I can recycle it locally instead of shipping it out to recycle.  I do like that, but so far I still prefer Preserve toothbrushes as an eco-friendly dental health choice.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality I expected it to wear out quick but so far after a month of continuous use it still looks and feels like it is new. The bristles are holding up and keeping their shape and feel. I don&#x27;t feel like it is too rough, it seems like it&#x27;s medium soft. It&#x27;s definitely not as soft as Colgate or oral b. The packaging and the tooth brush are supposed to be totally recyclable, but not in all areas at least not the plastic parts. I will definitely be buying another one.</li>
            <li> Did not like. too soft.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to hate this this toothbrush assuming it had natural hollow bristels which it doesn&#x27;t as a matter of fact there isn&#x27;t much that&#x27;s natural or green about it. (It&#x27;s made as conservately as possible from man made products)&lt;br /&gt;It is BPA free which is a huge plus, the bristles are soft and I like the different heights on it which allows you reach all the uneven spaces between your teeth. I think the head is way too big(comparing it to an Oral-B 60, which is huge) in length, --you&#x27;ll clean your teeth more effectively with a smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great and has a really comfortable grip so all in all if you choose not to use a power toothbrush (which is the way to go) this is nice brush with a reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;As far as recycling the brush feel free to use Tom&#x27;s Terracycle system though why anyone would pay money to recycle a toothbrush is beyond me ( great program for other difficult recyclables though) just toss it in with your normal plastic recyclables.</li>
            <li> With the attention that&#x27;s been given to BPA, the concerns and the change in a lot of baby and kid products, I never thought about whether the toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used and continue to use are BPA free. Toothbrushes are after all a plastic that you stick in your mouth twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are no artificial colors, that it&#x27;s a plant-based handle and can be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are also dye-free (as stated on the box) which makes me wonder, how much dye has been used (if any) in other toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it does say \\&quot;No animal testing\\&quot; but have you ever looked at the teeth of some animals? Hippos probably need a good brushing once in a while...but then the manufacturer would have to change the packaging to say \\&quot;No animal testing except for the teeth of Hippopotami\\&quot; and that just wouldn&#x27;t fit in the space on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush as far as toothbrushes go.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes a lot of Green claims about its toothbrush.  The plant-based plastic handle, no artificial colors and so on. I don&#x27;t really care.  I do care that they list it as a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush (I -only- use soft bristled brushes) and it&#x27;s not soft!  Perhaps it passes some toothbrush industry standard for softness - but it&#x27;s noticeably harder than the cheapest soft toothbrush from Kroger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also delight in mentioning the multi-height bristles.  Eh.  The cheap Kroger brush has those too.</li>
            <li> The humble toothbrush has been around longer than you might expect. Twigs and even porcupine quills were logical go-to tools for the ancients, and bristle toothbrushes were in use 1600 B.C., but the toothbrush went into mass production in 1780; the brainchild of a prisoner who cobbled one together in his cell and went on to become a wealthy businessman.  Somewhere in recent history, to be distinguished from competitors, they started growing neon fins, angled heads and brush designs to produce shock and awe to dazed consumers standing slack-jawed at the dizzying selection in the oral hygiene aisle at Target.  Now, with 50 million pounds of them tossed into American landfills each year, it seems ecologically prudent to offer a solution to a huge plastics problem.  So companies are now offering more responsible, renewable alternatives as this one by Tom&#x27;s.  The toothbrush itself is refreshingly simple in it&#x27;s design. The brush head is smallish and maneuverable and the bristles are soft which dentists recommend. The handle is slim and easy to hold in even small hands. The handle is made from the castor oil plant and not drilling sourced petroleum. (The castor oil plant is also the source of the dreaded toxin Ricin, though I&#x27;m fairly confident they&#x27;ve worked out that kink, since you place this thing in your mouth every day.)  I like this brush very much with it&#x27;s refreshingly simple, no nonsense design. The recycle feature, however well intentioned, is perhaps impractical in the real world. The process is part of the \\&quot;Tetracycle\\&quot; program. You must sign up online, then after collecting your used containers you box and send them to the recycle location. Shipping labels are said to be printable at home and at no cost.  On the surface great. But in reality, only the most dedicated consumers are going to separate, store, box and ship as described. Second, that process itself produces cardboard, paper and plastic bag waste.  Add to that the gasoline burned by delivery trucks and related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?  In reference to a product like this, alternatives exist, like toothbrushes made with bamboo handles which is a rapidly growing grass that needs no processing if thrown in the trash. It simply decomposes in a landfill. Apologies for an overkill review of a simple product. The reality seems to be, buy this for the effective design, but not to be a conscientious consumer. Other more realistic choices are now available for that.nd related transportation waste and pollution, electricity used in the recycle process from coal burning electric utilities, and in the best circumstances, is that system conserving anything?

            <li> Don&#x27;t exactly know what a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle would be in a toothbrush (I&#x27;m only just starting to move away from drug-store staples), but the bristles on this brush are NYLON. The description here on the web doesn&#x27;t reveal their composition. The package they arrive in says they&#x27;re nylon and they appear to be nylon. I gave 2 stars rather than more for this reason.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural! Tom&#x27;s is the best!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little softer. Other wise a really good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Bristle Toothbrush is a nice toothbrush.  It has a comfortable handle and soft, but effective bristles.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about eco friendly products, especially when they are made of plastic, but this is a very good toothbrush.  It has very nice tight bristles, a very good ergonomic handle, and is not neon colored.  It is superior in every way to the Oral B toothbrush that it replaced.  Of course that was a completely adequate, and even very good toothbrush, but this is a better one.</li>
            <li> My first impression upon opening this package was: Oh, great, another weird, uneven-bristled toothbrush. I generally prefer the straight, simple, classic design. However, as I gave it a try, I found the protruding bristles managed to get down into those hard-to-reach places. Contrary to what the package said, though, this is NOT a soft toothbrush. The stiff bristles made my gums bleed quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very lightweight, almost slipping out of my hand. It has a nice grip on the handle which perfectly conforms to your thumb and fingers. The exaggerated curvature of the handle looks funky but fits well in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy another one. I&#x27;m more of an Oral-B fan.</li>
            <li> I want to start my review by saying that I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for deodorant for a year or so, and have always bought their product because I think that their company is phenomenal. I was excited to see that they had a toothbrush option that was 100% recyclable right down to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this toothbrush for close to week now, and I usually end up brushing my teeth again because they don&#x27;t feel clean enough. I realize that &#x27;clean enough&#x27; is definitely the perception of the user, and for all I know, I&#x27;ve been over brushing my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is lightweight and the the soft bristles are very gentle and for me, it felt like I was using a child&#x27;s toothbrush. I think that if you are concerned about having a sustainable toothbrush then absolutely go for this, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review from 3 stars to 2- I used this toothbrush for a couple more weeks after this review, and I found that the bristles wore out very quickly, and that by the 3rd week, I needed to brush my teeth again by mid afternoon. It definitely is a very soft toothbrush and gentle on my gums, but I don&#x27;t think it did a great job of cleaning...sorry Tom&#x27;s!I still love your company :)</li>
            <li> Soft bristles. Prevents bleeding gums. if you want a new toothbrush, this is what i recommend... *shrugs* thats it lol</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I should use a soft toothbrush but every one that I tried never got my teeth feeling clean.  This one does.  I like that the materials are recycled and the color is very nice, too (I got a light blue).  I love Tom&#x27;s toothpastes (non-fluoride) and deodorants and trust the brand in general.  I can definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my toothbrushes and this one stands up to the challenge. I expected it to be wimpy since it is so eco-friendly, but I was wrong. The bristles are nice and soft, but do a great job of cleaning. The handle is comfortable as well. It is a bit pricey, but all of Tom&#x27;s of Maine items come with a hefty price tag - you do get what you pay for. This is a nice toothbrush and I recommend it hands down.</li>
            <li> This is a standard, no-frills toothbrush, comparable to what you&#x27;d get from a major brand like Oral-B at a lower price. And that seems to be the point: Tom&#x27;s of Maine wants you to enjoy a time-tested toothbrush design in a slightly more eco-friendy package (recyclable petroleum-free handle, dye-free bristles...). Is that worth a couple of extra bucks? Probably not. I suspect you could do more good by buying a cheaper toothbrush and donating the difference to a good environmental cause. But if it makes you feel better, by all means go for it. This is a fine, well-designed toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of some of Tom of Maine&#x27;s non-toxic mouthwashes and toothpastes, so I was curious to see what they would do with a toothbrush. I was expecting it to be some hippie unusable toothbrush, but it turned out to be surprisingly practical. It is hippie enough, both the toothbrush and the packaging are 100% recyclable, the toothbrush is plant based, BPA free with no artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has a rather unusual shape, but it is surprisingly practical, especially when getting to some of the angles needed to reach the back teeth. There is a thumb and finger rest of sorts on the middle of the handle. The handle uses less material than most other toothbrushes I have seen, so it is more flat, to the point where it looks rather unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is advertised as Soft, but in my experience, after a few weeks of intermittent usage, it feels more of a Soft to Medium. But it is soft enough for me and I like Soft. Intermittent usage because I like to use 2-3 different types and shapes of toothbrushes in parallel for more diverse brushing (to make up for blind spots and technique errors - wait is this an Olympic sport?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots and lots of toothbrushes out there, and there&#x27;s nothing magical about this one. But if you like the idea of a green toothbrush, or you are a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, or if you find it at a good price...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a typical toothbrush, just greener and healthier for you.  It does it&#x27;s job and is a good solid toothbrush.  I like that it is more sustainable, dye-free, and plant based.  I will be buying these again.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make a kids size.</li>
            <li> As far as toothbrushes go, this one is nice and soft and won&#x27;t rip up your gums if they are sensitive, like some of the other toothbrushes. To be honest though, it isn&#x27;t much different from the basic toothbrushes that dentists hand out for free. No real special shape, indicator, or anything of the such. Again, if you have sensitive gums or gum recession, this will probably be good for you.</li>
            <li> My only complaint: Why this Tom&#x27;s of MAINE product not made in Maine like all their toothpastes, deodorants, soaps, etc.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little bit bendy, which threw me for a loop but the brush is nice and big, so it reaches a lot of your teeth when you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  The head is narrow but normal length, wonderfully soft for my gums and scrubs the plaque away.  I brush with baking soda, so I need a soft brush to let the baking soda do all the work.  I got a light blue and it fits wonderfully in my hand and reaches all of my wisdom teeth way in the tight, tight back.  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> By far the best tooth brush I have used, doesn&#x27;t go flat after a months time like most. I get a new one every 2 months and use the old ones for trips and discard them before heading home.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted that this is an eco-friendly product, and if this means something to you then this toothbrush would be your choice. The handle is made of a recyclable castor oil plant and it is dye-free. It has an angled neck, ergonomic with multi-height bristles that are designed for good cleaning. This brand is slightly better compared this with my regular Oral B toothbrush (soft), but this is also a little more pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> im still undecided if id buy this one on a consistent basis. I will say they make a good, toothbrush that really does have soft bristles adn it tends to not annoy my gums. It cleans your teeth well without being super fancy- and is a good over all shape and flexible enough to keep you from brushing too hard.  Even so, i think the $5-$6 price tag is a bit much, jury still out on that.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush without all of the bells and whistles. Simple bristles stand up to several weeks still looking new. The handle is comfortable to hold and since it has no rubbery grip, it stays clean. Nice to know it is made with natural materials.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close to what I was looking for. Much better then 99% of the brushes on the market. This was my second one so I liked it enough. It&#x27;s exactly what it is advertised to be. I just wish there was a really awesome nature material brush but that all get bad reviews..</li>
            <li> I ordered the soft version of this toothbrush.  And I was surprised that it had some firmness underneath, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  And it was still soft enough for my sensitive gums.  So I can recommend this with confidence.</li>
            <li> If you replace your toothbrush as often as you&#x27;re \\&quot;supposed to\\&quot;, the net result is a lot of plastic in the garbage on a yearly basis.  I like that this toothbrush can be recycled and don&#x27;t mind paying a bit extra for it.  If only it included an envelope to mail it back to be recycled with, like some other brands do, it would make this even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it feels, it feels just like other soft toothbrushes, and the bristles do not pull out easily like in dollar store toothbrushes.  All in all, satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is THE tootbrush for the eco-warrior who cares about the planet so much, they are willing to pay extra for a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t harmful to the planet. It cleans my teeth well and works as well as any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. I like my toothbrushes simple and this fits the bill. It helps to be backed by the Tom&#x27;s of Maine namebrand as we are all familiar with the company producing quality eco-friendly products.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush, the bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh, which is good because I have sensitive gums which can bleed with stiffer bristles. Used it for about a month now, still in tact, time will tell how long it will last but if it holds out for a decent period of time, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife uses Tom&#x27;s toothpaste and she enjoys it (I use a high flouride toothpaste I buy from my dentist). My grandmother lived in Maine for many years.  Basically, the Tom&#x27;s marketing program finds a home in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered the toothbrush, and found it to be a very worth competitor with those available in my local grocery store.  The soft is a little more stiff than those typically labeled \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; and the handle is more flexible than the petroleum based plastics. It cleans my teeth just fine, the most important aspect of the process being the time and care I put into brushing, not necessarily the brush itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Tom&#x27;s for placing a worthy bio-plastic product that can actually compete against the traditional plastic items.  I also get free toothbrushes from my dentist, but in between those visits, I&#x27;d definitely reach for a Tom&#x27;s bio-plastic toothbrush. A dollar or a dollar and a half is a small price to pay, twice a year, to encourage the development of more petroleum plastic alternatives.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush is a toothbrush, right?  That is what I thought until I tried Tom&#x27;s.  This toothbrush is light weight and has a grip and shape that makes it easy to get to all portions of the mouth.  The bristles are soft and leave the mouth feeling clean.  I am glad that I found Tom&#x27;s and learned that a toothbrush is not just a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s Naturally Clean Soft Toothbruth.  I love this toothbrush because it has bristles of assorted sizes; I prefer those type of toothbrushes over the ones that have all one even size.  I also love it because it is ecology-friendly; the package tells all the good things about it ecology-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love toothbrushes and dental products.  I am a \\&quot;dental\\&quot; person.  I love for my teeth to be clean and healthy.  It would be horrible to not have teeth, or to not have healthy teeth.  I think our teeth do so much more for us than we give them credit for:  they help us talk, they chew our food for us, they are bone mass that produces white blood cells (or something like that), and they keep our faces from sinking in.  Teeth are very important and should be given much more credit than we give them, and they should be taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change out my toothbrush very often; that&#x27;s what we are suppose to do.  I love clean and healthy teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush; highly recommended.</li>
