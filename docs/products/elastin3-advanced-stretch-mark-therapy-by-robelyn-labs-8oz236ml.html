    <ol>
            <li>Their study was conducted in a lab and they claim to be the best stretch mark remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent results.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff created.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe anything will work, This was supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li>Best stretch mark cream ever!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for the skin and stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>GREAT product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s an amazing price on amazon!</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase Skinception after all because they have the highest ranking on every site and all reviews I read were good.</li>
            <li>but the results aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>It also has a good fragrance.</li>
            <li>been using for 2weeks and the result is good.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>Great product, and has a light smell.</li>
            <li>I am rating the product two stars because it does smell and feel nice on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I visited the online site for the makers of this product and was convinced by their professional comparrison of others on the market that Elastin3 is the best.</li>
            <li>The thing is that Avon is not even considered to be in the top 10 ranking stretch mark products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of the cream and will probably need more</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Which in turn, makes me love it.  </li>
            <li>Great item will recommend to someone else help out with the streach marks more than not using it thanks buyer</li>
            <li>and I was more concerned with my lighter stretch marks</li>
            <li>So many muscles</li>
            <li>I feel like the end of Unbreakable when Sam Jackson told Bruce Willis that he wasn&#x27;t a mistake and that he sacrificed so many people to find him.</li>
            <li>Well I sacrificed so many bucks and found this and said what the heck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams but nothing else has even come close.</li>
            <li>I think in one or two more tubes my stretch marks wont even be noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It smells better than striVectin</li>
            <li>I bought bio oil and that seems to be working a lot better..</li>
            <li>Infact I got more stretch marks after using this product.</li>
            <li>My cetaphil cream seems to work better.</li>
            <li>I would never pay more than $50 for this cream</li>
            <li>I used another cream about 10 years ago that was much better and still on the market now.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using vaseline.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a present and the person is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, she is buying more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>and I see significant improvements to the stretch marks on my buttocks!</li>
            <li>So far this product is great.  </li>
            <li>But so far Elastin works great for me.  </li>
            <li>also love the light lotion texture and the scent.  </li>
            <li>So I really question how good elastin3 is.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>but this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>and we both enjoyed the results and the texture and mild smell.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in my stretch marks and my face in just one 6 ounce tube.</li>
            <li>so I got huge \\&quot;red\\&quot; bumpy scars.</li>
            <li>when they reduced in size (it is important to apply both when growing AND when reducing, as body building people etc may tell you).</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I overall am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Not only is it supposed to help the stretch marks I have more!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>To me it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and has a smooth light texture.</li>
            <li>I use it during the day because it is light and absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good product, not only for pregnancy but life and/or weight loss.</li>
            <li>I have a real muscular body was developing more stretch marks.</li>
            <li>i used this while pregnant and overall it did a good job</li>
            <li>I got this product to prevent stretch marks while I&#x27;m pregnant.  </li>
            <li>My doctor also recommended this to use when I was newly pregnant</li>
            <li>Now she recommends it to everyone who is pregnant.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my first pregnancy and noticed a huge difference between my stomach after birth verses my sisters (who did not use the product).</li>
            <li>I used this cream on my belly during my first pregnancy and never got one stretch mark!</li>
            <li>I paid $80 a bottle on the product website last time and am so glad I found this price this time!</li>
            <li>I used this lotion during my first pregnancy and it works!</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks great and my original stretch marks are definitly definitly not more noticable than before pregnancy.</li>
            <li>But for a 100 lbs girl who got zero stretch marks on her stomach, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>and if me stretchmarks were the smaller kind they would have already been gone by now.</li>
            <li>To me that is success.</li>
            <li>I think Elastin3 is worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>but i wont say it&#x27;s worth the money i payed.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product to me when I first found out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I was right</li>
            <li>I know this product works because in the beginning I forgot to lather underneath my breast, and that is the only spot I notice very light stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I used this exclusively with my first pregnancy and had no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am sure not everyone&#x27;s skin reacts the same.  </li>
            <li>Very quenching for your skin!</li>
            <li>It has made my life and confidence higher.</li>
            <li>I will def order more till they are no trace left.</li>
            <li>Well, I am satisfied with this product, bought after the birth of my daughter in November last year.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous stretch mark creams and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I have used it since the first time I found out</li>
            <li>It can probably be a nice body cream, but other than that</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been that long since I&#x27;ve been using it, perhaps about a month give or take (its not a miracle cream that will cure, I am well aware) but this product has helped them look a bit better</li>
            <li>But Elastin is really improving them.  </li>
            <li>Using quality creams/oils, gaining a reasonable amount of weight at a reasonable rate, and HYDRATING will save your skin.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>I never scratch and always scrub my skin very well before</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>right after my son was born and he is now 4 months old.</li>
            <li>It actually smoothed my old ones better than my new ones.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the appearance of my stretch marks compared to their natural fading during the post-partum period of the first pregnancy when I did not use it.  </li>
            <li>it is not worth more.</li>
            <li>It not only has prevented stretch marks from appearing, it also has faded the stretch marks I had before I became pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant for the second time and decided to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>my disatisfaction I used a much cheaper brand of Avon stretch mark remover in the past and saw better and faster results.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the extra money for the name brand.</li>
            <li>I have no trace of new marks either.</li>
            <li>I did on my breasts, when i stopped, they filled, and went down.</li>
            <li>I searched long and hard for awesome creams due to the fact I am insanely tiny and probably should not have babies.</li>
            <li>As far as it working, I would say yes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would say that any prevention or improvement is either genetic or a natural fading process that your body goes through after birth.    </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not all the way satisfied but at least it helped in a way.</li>
            <li>The stretch marks are much lighter and my overall skin is smoother.</li>
            <li>, my breast got big too fast</li>
            <li>, now it did make my skin extremely soft and tightened it up a bit</li>
            <li>and i can notice a significant amount of my stretchmarks have disappeared and the worse of the worse are so light now that im sure in another month</li>
            <li>Therefore, I conclude, using my post-partum period of the first pregnancy as a control study, that this product does not live up to its claim.    </li>
            <li>Im on my 3rd bottle because a little bit goes a long way and my skin absorb nicely.</li>
            <li>I just bought my first bottle since my last pregnancy in preparation for an anticipated second pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and usually about 140lb and gained 35 pounds while pregnant, so I did put on a normal amount of weight.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell if they have faded even more as a result of my current use of this product.</li>
            <li>At first I used it every other day after I would shower.  </li>
            <li>I used this cream in the mornings, Bio Oil in the evenings, drank at least 80-100 ozs of water daily, and tried to be concious of what I was eating so that I didn&#x27;t gain too much weight too quickly.</li>
            <li>I was very conscious of it because my mom got them when she was pregnant (and they say your fate is usually the same as your moms).</li>
            <li>or so they&#x27;ll be barely noticeable as well</li>
            <li>I have used this religiously twice a day directly after exfoliating in the shower...</li>
            <li>and I must say the results are pretty immediate (less than 1 week)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m maybe half way through my first tube.</li>
            <li>This product didnt prevent stretch marks but heal them, my breast got smooth and the scars are very small</li>
            <li>Only I can see my stretch marks not other people.</li>
            <li>i do belive that is the fault of my child pushing up so high and not having enough give (im very tiny) in my stomach so it stretched.</li>
            <li>I see a minor change in the appearance of my 14 year old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased strivectin sd from my local tj max for 29.95 (its sold for much more online) and let me say its done more In one week than elastin did in four months, due to realizing that I&#x27;m now lowering this to two stars:( if this stuff doesnt work for you definitely try strivectin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> , my breast got big too fast</li>
            <li> , now it did make my skin extremely soft and tightened it up a bit</li>
            <li> and i can notice a significant amount of my stretchmarks have disappeared and the worse of the worse are so light now that im sure in another month</li>
            <li> Therefore, I conclude, using my post-partum period of the first pregnancy as a control study, that this product does not live up to its claim.    </li>
            <li> Im on my 3rd bottle because a little bit goes a long way and my skin absorb nicely.</li>
            <li> I just bought my first bottle since my last pregnancy in preparation for an anticipated second pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and usually about 140lb and gained 35 pounds while pregnant, so I did put on a normal amount of weight.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if they have faded even more as a result of my current use of this product.</li>
            <li> At first I used it every other day after I would shower.  </li>
            <li> I used this cream in the mornings, Bio Oil in the evenings, drank at least 80-100 ozs of water daily, and tried to be concious of what I was eating so that I didn&#x27;t gain too much weight too quickly.</li>
            <li> I was very conscious of it because my mom got them when she was pregnant (and they say your fate is usually the same as your moms).</li>
            <li> or so they&#x27;ll be barely noticeable as well</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously twice a day directly after exfoliating in the shower...</li>
            <li> and I must say the results are pretty immediate (less than 1 week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m maybe half way through my first tube.</li>
            <li> This product didnt prevent stretch marks but heal them, my breast got smooth and the scars are very small</li>
            <li> Only I can see my stretch marks not other people.</li>
            <li> i do belive that is the fault of my child pushing up so high and not having enough give (im very tiny) in my stomach so it stretched.</li>
            <li> I see a minor change in the appearance of my 14 year old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased strivectin sd from my local tj max for 29.95 (its sold for much more online) and let me say its done more In one week than elastin did in four months, due to realizing that I&#x27;m now lowering this to two stars:( if this stuff doesnt work for you definitely try strivectin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other buyers please do not waste your money on this product i want my money back today is 1/21/2014 8:27am</li>
            <li> I am now due in 5 weeks and so far no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Its improved the general appearance of my stretch marks smoothing them a bit and brought back some of the color on my skin that was lost due to the scars.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I started lifting heavy again and saw a few more forming on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I imaging each person is different in effectiveness, due to different skin types and such.  </li>
            <li> So far my girlfriend has used this for a month and the marks on her stomach and thighs are MUCH less visible.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen much in the way of results but it keeps the skin soft...kind of expensive too...</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago to treat my existing stretch marks, which were very mature after two pregnancies.  </li>
            <li> I have some pretty serious stretch marks too.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I actually got a few new once since using it from slight weight gain</li>
            <li> When i finished my 2nd bottle, i used other stretch mark creams from Korea &amp; Italy</li>
            <li> I have not had a single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who claims that it works can only convince me if they applied to half their belly and left the other half alone and saw a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I have not noticed a drastic change maybe only a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical and was discouraged by the price, but yes, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This cream is also very messy and you have to rubb it in so much that after a while you are not sure if it is just being rubbed off on to your hand instead of the affected area.</li>
            <li> so the mess was limited.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and helps to reduce the appearance of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and I feel as if I wasted and was robbed a few hundred dollars when converted to my local currency.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the price</li>
            <li> At this rate, they will be gone in a month&#x27;s time or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really assuming this is a fake product wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I bought this from groupon for half off.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I&#x27;ve only purchased 3 bottles through my entire pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> When I got pregnant I was worried about stretch marks because I got REALLY bad ones during puberty.</li>
            <li> This product was a little pricy for me</li>
            <li> ive been using elastin 3 a little over a month now</li>
            <li> Price really wasn&#x27;t an issue I have just been desperate for something that works.</li>
            <li> I used this from 3 months all the way post-pregnancy for a few months.</li>
            <li> I wasted over $1000 of dollars and had stretch marks since I was in high-school.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad to say it didn&#x27;t work 60 bucks later.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> its hard to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> This sucks but</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it&#x27;s expensive but you also get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> But we are confused why the marks on her side remain.  </li>
            <li> I had low self esteem and hated my skin.</li>
            <li> My complaints would be that it is expensive, and it also had very very horrible chemicals in it which some people may not like (such as parabens).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to buy again.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks dont desapear completelly they fade and lose the horrible bumps</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I visited the online site for the makers of this product and was convinced by their professional comparrison of others on the market that Elastin3 is the best. Their study was conducted in a lab and they claim to be the best stretch mark remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my disatisfaction I used a much cheaper brand of Avon stretch mark remover in the past and saw better and faster results. The thing is that Avon is not even considered to be in the top 10 ranking stretch mark products. So I really question how good elastin3 is. This cream is also very messy and you have to rubb it in so much that after a while you are not sure if it is just being rubbed off on to your hand instead of the affected area. I decided to purchase Skinception after all because they have the highest ranking on every site and all reviews I read were good. Elastin3 cost a lot of money and I feel as if I wasted and was robbed a few hundred dollars when converted to my local currency.</li>
            <li> This product was a little pricy for me but I decided to take a chance and it actually works. I have lots of stretch marks on my stomach and they are beginning to blend in with the rest of my skin. I&#x27;m almost out of the cream and will probably need more but I&#x27;m definitely seeing some results!</li>
            <li> I was the fool to order a liquid in March living in the north east. When it arrived the end had exploded from freezing but thankfully the product came in a bag so the mess was limited. Overall, The product improved the texture of my skin but after a month of using it, the stretch marks were not affected. It was an improvement but no miracle.</li>
            <li> ive been using elastin 3 a little over a month now and i can notice a significant amount of my stretchmarks have disappeared and the worse of the worse are so light now that im sure in another month or so they&#x27;ll be barely noticeable as well my only complaint is the price but how can you put a price on self esteem</li>
            <li> I got this product to prevent stretch marks while I&#x27;m pregnant.  It not only has prevented stretch marks from appearing, it also has faded the stretch marks I had before I became pregnant.  One bottle lasted me about 4 months.  At first I used it every other day after I would shower.  Now I use it about twice a week.  It smells nice and makes your skin nice and soft.  I love this product.  Definately worth the extra money for the name brand.</li>
            <li> I have had marks on my inner thighs and arms for years now from weight training and just accepted that I was going to have them forever. A few months ago I started lifting heavy again and saw a few more forming on my arms and legs. After only one week of use, my scars are fading drastically, even the darker ones. I was so skeptical and was discouraged by the price, but yes, it is worth it. At this rate, they will be gone in a month&#x27;s time or less. Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I used this exclusively with my first pregnancy and had no stretch marks. My sister used it as well and we both enjoyed the results and the texture and mild smell. I am using it with my 2nd pregnancy and will do so well after until my body is fully back!</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for awesome creams due to the fact I am insanely tiny and probably should not have babies. I was thinking I was guaranteed to get stretch marks. I used this from 3 months all the way post-pregnancy for a few months. I believe I bought 2 or 3 bottles total. It is very expensive. But for a 100 lbs girl who got zero stretch marks on her stomach, it was worth it. I used it on my breasts too, during. but i stopped after birth, as it said not to put it there if nursing. that is when i got stretch marks, on my ta-tas. when they reduced in size (it is important to apply both when growing AND when reducing, as body building people etc may tell you). So i indeed feel it worked. My stomach itched, hurt, felt like it would pop. But i never got stretch marks. I did on my breasts, when i stopped, they filled, and went down. As far as it working, I would say yes. My complaints would be that it is expensive, and it also had very very horrible chemicals in it which some people may not like (such as parabens). I&#x27;m no longer alright with such things. But it did work for me.</li>
            <li> So far this product is great.  This is my 2nd tube and it is working wonders. I have some pretty serious stretch marks too.  My last child was born 23 years ago, so I have let this go for some time.  But Elastin is really improving them.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible.  I imaging each person is different in effectiveness, due to different skin types and such.  I am sure not everyone&#x27;s skin reacts the same.  So I guess it&#x27;s a matter of trial and error.  But so far Elastin works great for me.  Will probably order 3rd tube soon.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and helps to reduce the appearance of stretch marks. You have to be diligent is use because it makes time.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago to treat my existing stretch marks, which were very mature after two pregnancies.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the appearance of my stretch marks compared to their natural fading during the post-partum period of the first pregnancy when I did not use it.  Therefore, I conclude, using my post-partum period of the first pregnancy as a control study, that this product does not live up to its claim.    Anyone who claims that it works can only convince me if they applied to half their belly and left the other half alone and saw a difference.  Otherwise, I would say that any prevention or improvement is either genetic or a natural fading process that your body goes through after birth.    I am rating the product two stars because it does smell and feel nice on your skin.  It&#x27;s not a greasy product at all.  It can probably be a nice body cream, but other than that, I do not see any reason why a consumer should pay the premium for what this product claims to do.</li>
            <li> Great product, and has a light smell. Very quenching for your skin! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good product, not only for pregnancy but life and/or weight loss.</li>
            <li> So far my girlfriend has used this for a month and the marks on her stomach and thighs are MUCH less visible.  But we are confused why the marks on her side remain.  We are assuming it is because she hasn&#x27;t lost all of her baby weight.  Bur overall, she loves it.  Which in turn, makes me love it.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Excellent results. Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great item will recommend to someone else help out with the streach marks more than not using it thanks buyer</li>
            <li> This product helped my darker stretch marks but not the lighter ones and I was more concerned with my lighter stretch marks so I&#x27;m not all the way satisfied but at least it helped in a way.</li>
            <li> My doctor also recommended this to use when I was newly pregnant and I must say the results are pretty immediate (less than 1 week) and I see significant improvements to the stretch marks on my buttocks! The stretch marks are much lighter and my overall skin is smoother. The stretch marks on the thighs take a bit longer but i see that they have become lighter too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the light lotion texture and the scent.  When i finished my 2nd bottle, i used other stretch mark creams from Korea &amp; Italy and i didn&#x27;t like their textures (too creamy &amp; sticky for me). Also, i didn&#x27;t feel the results were comparable to Elastin.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product. I have tried every cream, oil, tanning solution and needle pricking. I tried oatmeal and everything under the sun. I had low self esteem and hated my skin. I have a real muscular body was developing more stretch marks. So many muscles and I did not want to take off my shirt. I almost tried every product created. I feel like the end of Unbreakable when Sam Jackson told Bruce Willis that he wasn&#x27;t a mistake and that he sacrificed so many people to find him. Well I sacrificed so many bucks and found this and said what the heck. This is the best stuff created. It has made my life and confidence higher. This is a miracle cream. Only I can see my stretch marks not other people. I wasted over $1000 of dollars and had stretch marks since I was in high-school. I contemplated surgery but this is the best hands down. I am not even done with the bottle yet. I will def order more till they are no trace left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really assuming this is a fake product wasted my money on this. other buyers please do not waste your money on this product i want my money back today is 1/21/2014 8:27am</li>
            <li> Well, I am satisfied with this product, bought after the birth of my daughter in November last year. last month of pregnancy stretch marks appeared on my stomach and glutes. passed the cream massaging the affected areas two to three times a day. took pictures of the beginning of when I started using and some time later and realized that the marks were fading. it all happened in December 2013 until today, is recent. I added the cream mixing oil for stretch marks another brand. the only thing I know is that I am relieved to see that the marks have improved a lot, and I intend to buy another when done.</li>
            <li> I used this for my first pregnancy and noticed a huge difference between my stomach after birth verses my sisters (who did not use the product). She only gained 24 pounds with her pregnancy and I gained 63. Definitely recommend-also this product was recommended by my OBGYN</li>
            <li> I have used this through two pregnancies and manage to make it through with no stretch marks. I know everyone says it&#x27;s genetics but I truly believe it has a lot to do with how well you take care of your skin. Using quality creams/oils, gaining a reasonable amount of weight at a reasonable rate, and HYDRATING will save your skin. I used this cream in the mornings, Bio Oil in the evenings, drank at least 80-100 ozs of water daily, and tried to be concious of what I was eating so that I didn&#x27;t gain too much weight too quickly. Used with two pregnancies, gained 30 lbs both times, no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this from groupon for half off. I&#x27;m maybe half way through my first tube. It smells fresh and has a smooth light texture. It lasts for a while. I actually prefer something a bit heavier. I see a minor change in the appearance of my 14 year old stretch marks. It actually smoothed my old ones better than my new ones. I actually got a few new once since using it from slight weight gain so it didn&#x27;t work preventatively for me. I would recommend applying multiple times a day. After this tube I will not repurchase. I just haven&#x27;t seen a big enough difference to justify the price. I&#x27;m going back to striVectin. It made a huge difference in my stretch marks and my face in just one 6 ounce tube. I&#x27;ve tried many creams but nothing else has even come close. I think in one or two more tubes my stretch marks wont even be noticeable.  I was planning on ordering it when I seen the groupon ad and decided to try  elastin instead. It smells better than striVectin but the results aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I bought this while 7 months along and I&#x27;m sad to say it didn&#x27;t work 60 bucks later. I&#x27;ve never had stretch marks and I got a bunch when 6 months Along I bought this thinking it has to work and a month later it hasn&#x27;t.. It&#x27;s too expensive to buy again. I bought bio oil and that seems to be working a lot better.. Much cheaper too. Price really wasn&#x27;t an issue I have just been desperate for something that works.</li>
            <li> I use this product my hole pregnancy Im on my 3rd bottle because a little bit goes a long way and my skin absorb nicely. The stretch marks dont desapear completelly they fade and lose the horrible bumps, my breast got big too fast I went from nothing to big C so I got huge \\&quot;red\\&quot; bumpy scars. This product didnt prevent stretch marks but heal them, my breast got smooth and the scars are very small I think they will desapear after the breast feeding.  On my belly I never got any stretch marks. I never scratch and always scrub my skin very well before put on the lotion 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> It did not help in preventing stretch marks at all! Infact I got more stretch marks after using this product. My cetaphil cream seems to work better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Not only is it supposed to help the stretch marks I have more!! it didn&#x27;t help me at all. I wont spend the money on this item again.. let alone anyother. I don&#x27;t believe anything will work, This was supposed to be the best. WAAAAHHHHH This sucks but its life I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 weeks and I have not noticed a drastic change maybe only a little bit. I would never pay more than $50 for this cream it is not worth more. I used another cream about 10 years ago that was much better and still on the market now. I should have went with my instinct and bought that one again. Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I overall am happy with the product.Its improved the general appearance of my stretch marks smoothing them a bit and brought back some of the color on my skin that was lost due to the scars. It hasn&#x27;t been that long since I&#x27;ve been using it, perhaps about a month give or take (its not a miracle cream that will cure, I am well aware) but this product has helped them look a bit better and if me stretchmarks were the smaller kind they would have already been gone by now.</li>
            <li> Best stretch mark cream ever! The only downfall is that it&#x27;s expensive but you also get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Bought this figuring it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try...I was right, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> When I got pregnant I was worried about stretch marks because I got REALLY bad ones during puberty. My friend who gained A LOT of wieght during her pregnancy suggested this product. She used generous amounts 3x daily and got no marks. Now she recommends it to everyone who is pregnant. I started using it at 5 months and at 9 1/2 months (45 pounds gained / 5&#x27;6\\&quot;) I have no trace of new marks either. It has been over 20 years since I got the stretch marks during puberty so they have already faded to silver lines. Hard to tell if they have faded even more as a result of my current use of this product. I should have taken a picture in the beginning. Now my skin looks great and my original stretch marks are definitly definitly not more noticable than before pregnancy. To me that is success. I think Elastin3 is worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Going back to this product. I have tried numerous stretch mark creams and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me when I first found out I was pregnant.  I am now due in 5 weeks and so far no stretch marks.  I know this product works because in the beginning I forgot to lather underneath my breast, and that is the only spot I notice very light stretch marks.  I would definitely recommend it. It is expensive, but I&#x27;ve only purchased 3 bottles through my entire pregnancy.  It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> its hard to tell if it works. Applying it as directed (two times a day) I haven&#x27;t really seen much in the way of results but it keeps the skin soft...kind of expensive too...</li>
            <li> 1/22/13 I recently purchased strivectin sd from my local tj max for 29.95 (its sold for much more online) and let me say its done more In one week than elastin did in four months, due to realizing that I&#x27;m now lowering this to two stars:( if this stuff doesnt work for you definitely try strivectin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;purchased this cream right after my son was born and he is now 4 months old.I have used this religiously twice a day directly after exfoliating in the shower...Now let me start by saying this didnt reduce my stretch marks, im 18 and african american., now it did make my skin extremely soft and tightened it up a bit but i wont say it&#x27;s worth the money i payed.</li>
            <li> I used this cream on my belly during my first pregnancy and never got one stretch mark! I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and usually about 140lb and gained 35 pounds while pregnant, so I did put on a normal amount of weight. I already have lots of stretch marks on my hips and upper thighs from when I was a teenager and gained weight rapidly, but I was saved from them during pregnancy! I was very conscious of it because my mom got them when she was pregnant (and they say your fate is usually the same as your moms). I just bought my first bottle since my last pregnancy in preparation for an anticipated second pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I would never do without it! And it&#x27;s an amazing price on amazon! I paid $80 a bottle on the product website last time and am so glad I found this price this time!</li>
            <li> Again this was for my fiance&#x27;.  She swears by it so if she says it works then I believe her.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion during my first pregnancy and it works! No stretch marks at all. I am pregnant for the second time and decided to buy it again. I use it during the day because it is light and absorbs really quick. It is not greasy and will not stain your clothes. It also has a good fragrance. Highly recommend it! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  This is my 4th pregnancy and I have used it since the first time I found out I was pregnant.  I have not had a single stretch mark!  I use it all through my pregnancy on my chest and belly and continue to use it until I am done breastfeeding.  I definitely think it helps in prevention of stretch marks!  I can not speak to its ability to diminish existing stretch marks.  To me it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> been using for 2weeks and the result is good. Stretch mark is diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. You&#x27;re better off using vaseline.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.  Excellent product for the skin and stretch marks.  I bought it for a present and the person is very happy with it.  In fact, she is buying more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> My wife used it her last pregnancy and it&#x27;s worked well!!!</li>
            <li> i used this while pregnant and overall it did a good job however i did end up with some stretch marks towards the end of my pregnancy. i do belive that is the fault of my child pushing up so high and not having enough give (im very tiny) in my stomach so it stretched.</li>
