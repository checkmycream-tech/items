            <li>EXCELLENT BRUSH!  </li>
            <li>PERFECT FOR WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ... VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR SERVICE</li>
            <li>it would have been brilliant!</li>
            <li>ORDERED, CAME IN GREAT TIMING...</li>
            <li>save your money and buy a good brush instead.</li>
            <li>Nice idea to have it battery operated, great for travel, but as a styling tool, forget it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a rotating hairbrush with no cords or hot air blowing, this brush was perfect!</li>
            <li>works as it should, I actually kind of like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turned out this item is more of a curling iron than a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I would love to have a battery operated blow dryer, but they just don&#x27;t make them.  </li>
            <li>and if it does, it leaves static....</li>
            <li>Creates static in the hair.</li>
            <li>You wont be able to style with it.</li>
            <li>Without the blow dryer it just sits on top of her hair.</li>
            <li>so that when the blow dryer heat hits it, it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron.</li>
            <li>Would rather have bought a cheap non-electronic brush because they brush through hair better.</li>
            <li>This spin brush did infact spin,my hair right into knots!  </li>
            <li>I got a full refund.  </li>
            <li>The brussels were too soft to untangle and when the brush was turned on, it caught on my fine hair which is usually easy to brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do any good on my hair if my hair is already dry.</li>
            <li>However, I will buy this again just to save my arm from having to do so much work!!</li>
            <li>But most women ( or men) with naturally curly hair with some volume CAN NOT use this at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cool though.</li>
            <li>the only good thing is that I have four new batteries spare.  </li>
            <li>I love my conair rotating warm air brush and thought that this would be the same, only battery operated.  </li>
            <li>My mother likes it, but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering a brush that blew hot air.</li>
            <li>and she uses it everyday to smooth the top layer of her hair and flip the ends under while using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The reason for the return:  I was displeased with the large size of the brush.  </li>
            <li>; I hoped it plugged in with a cord, since she can&#x27;t get out to shop for stuff like batteries very often.</li>
            <li>I really needed a battery operated brush that I could use where there are no electrical outlets</li>
            <li>It may be because the heating element requires too much power.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t really imagine this working for anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use brush but carefully!</li>
            <li>Does not even go through my hair, which is not thick....</li>
            <li>No more useful than a normal cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Many of us who blow out our hair usually have to keep turning the brush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live near Mom, so I never saw the item after it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for an old fashioned \\&quot;hot comb\\&quot; style brush dryer like I used back in the 70&#x27;s, and this one looked like it would fill the bill.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice it needed batteries (although it clearly states this)</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Bristles too soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were to soft to go through my hair</li>
            <li>When the bristles cooled, they remained too soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft and too short and don&#x27;t grab the hair.</li>
            <li>only thing.. the bristles are way to soft.</li>
            <li>When I first got these, I thought the bristles were too stiff.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Thought I was buying a drying styling brush. Turned out to just be a brush powered by batteries, that twirls either direction. Was hoping this would dry and style my hair when camping.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews.  I love my conair rotating warm air brush and thought that this would be the same, only battery operated.  Wrong.  Very wrong.  I have just wasted my money on it and the only good thing is that I have four new batteries spare.  It tangles immediately.  It only styles dry hair(what? why?)  I don&#x27;t see the point of this brush AT ALL except that it promised a lot and delivered nothing.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions included on how to best use this brush. Consequently, my hair tangled in the brush whenever I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> My mother, who lives in a nursing home, resists bathing because she doesn&#x27;t like to go to bed with wet hair. She has curly hair, and I was looking for a hand held hair dryer (not a blow dryer!) that she could use to dry her curly hair before bed without blowing the curl out. I was looking for an old fashioned \\&quot;hot comb\\&quot; style brush dryer like I used back in the 70&#x27;s, and this one looked like it would fill the bill. I don&#x27;t live near Mom, so I never saw the item after it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice it needed batteries (although it clearly states this); I hoped it plugged in with a cord, since she can&#x27;t get out to shop for stuff like batteries very often. Batteries are required and not included.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out this item is more of a curling iron than a hair dryer. My mother likes it, but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT BRUSH!  This brush is intended to aid in styling.  Blow out hair until almost dry.  Then take the brush and use it to do the turning for you while your other hand holds the dryer.  Many of us who blow out our hair usually have to keep turning the brush.  That is all this is intended to do -- turn the bristles for you.  When you are done, you may have to use a straightener if you prefer straighter hair, or using a curling iron to suit whatever styling you want to do.  But for me, this brush saves my arms getting tired.  You can also use this on the second day by spraying a little water or styling spray on the areas you want to &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; some (bangs, sides, etc) and then using dryer while the brush spins your hair.  This tool is only one of my several.  However, I will buy this again just to save my arm from having to do so much work!!</li>
            <li> Only one step above a ordinary brush. Save your money and use your regular brush unless you have a wrist problem.&lt;br /&gt;It has very little power.</li>
            <li> If you have hair then do not buy this &amp;#34;styling brush&amp;#34;. Or what I should say if you have hair that&#x27;s so thin you can see your scalp this might work for you. But most women ( or men) with naturally curly hair with some volume CAN NOT use this at all. It doesn&#x27;t have the power to spin through a person&#x27;s hair. You can hear it struggling to move ( spin) .Please save your money and buy a good brush instead.</li>
            <li> Without heat, this brush just does nothing.  I really needed a battery operated brush that I could use where there are no electrical outlets and I thought this would work.  I am so disappointed.  I would love to have a battery operated blow dryer, but they just don&#x27;t make them.  I don&#x27;t understand why it is so difficult, since there are battery operated vacuums, etc.  It may be because the heating element requires too much power.  What a shame!  I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> This spin brush did infact spin,my hair right into knots!  I have think straight hair and this was NOT a good product for me.  The static it created was horrible as well!  Iw oudl nto recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. It does not do anything that it is advertised to do. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, absolutely useless.  Does not even go through my hair, which is not thick....and if it does, it leaves static....doesn&#x27;t anybody test these things?  I can&#x27;t really imagine this working for anyone.</li>
            <li> ORDERED, CAME IN GREAT TIMING...PERFECT FOR WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ... VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR SERVICE WOULD DEF RECOMMEND THEM</li>
            <li> Not quite made for use with a blow dryer, needs to be a metal shell so that when the blow dryer heat hits it, it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron.</li>
            <li> Bristles too soft.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Useless. Creates static in the hair. Does not heat up.</li>
            <li> Utterly useless. The bristles are too soft and too short and don&#x27;t grab the hair. It should have attachments for different lengths and quality of hair. This one was totally useless for me.  Nice idea to have it battery operated, great for travel, but as a styling tool, forget it.</li>
            <li> Waist of money. You wont be able to style with it. Would not recommend to buy this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted a rotating hairbrush with no cords or hot air blowing, this brush was perfect! 😄Until I followed the directions to put in the batteries😫now the cover won&#x27;t stay on and it seems to have started to come apart in the middle of the brush. Poor quality by Con-air! I&#x27;m able to use brush but carefully!</li>
            <li> The reason for the return:  I was displeased with the large size of the brush.  So I was allowed to return it.  I got a full refund.  Thank you!  I appreciate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they only had a smaller brush for my short hair...it would have been brilliant!</li>
            <li> Could not brush through hair when turned on. Did not do its job. No more useful than a normal cheap brush. Would rather have bought a cheap non-electronic brush because they brush through hair better. The brussels were too soft to untangle and when the brush was turned on, it caught on my fine hair which is usually easy to brush.</li>
            <li> I have thin shoulder length hair and this brush was a nightmare for me. The bristles were to soft to go through my hair but it somehow managed to get caught up in the barrel anyway and pull. My daughter has very thick chin length hair and she uses it everyday to smooth the top layer of her hair and flip the ends under while using a blow dryer. Without the blow dryer it just sits on top of her hair.</li>
            <li> works as it should, I actually kind of like it. only thing.. the bristles are way to soft. it&#x27;s pretty cool though.</li>
            <li> Hair tangles and tears really bad.  I don&#x27;t like and don&#x27;t use.  Will be a donation to the local land fill.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a brush that blew hot air. It doesn&#x27;t do any good on my hair if my hair is already dry. I completely wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> When I first got these, I thought the bristles were too stiff.  When I started using with the blow dryer, the stiffness almost made sense.  The heat from the blow dryer made the bristles too soft to the point of not able to &#x27;brush&#x27; through my hair.  When the bristles cooled, they remained too soft.  Very disappointed.  I gave this product 2 stars only because maybe they will work with finer hair.</li>
