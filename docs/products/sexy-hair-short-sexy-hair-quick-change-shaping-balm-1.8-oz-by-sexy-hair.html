            <li> I love this stuff -- however, I have never seen it on sale anywhere for more than $16.95.  That&#x27;s the price I pay for it at CVS -- so I don&#x27;t know why you have the original price listed as $31.92.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the hairdressers but this is a much better value for a great product.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not get the item pictured.  The product I did get has the same name but it is a different container and a different product.  It does not have a shine or hold rating like the pictured product.  It does not look or feel like the product I am familiar with.  I may adjust the rating after trying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item on the left in the photos is what I expected, got item on the right.  Also note the open shot.</li>
            <li> Received very promptly and am thrilled to have it.  The salon that I&#x27;ve been buying it for years told me it was discontinued.  I would be lost without it.  Makes my thin, lifeless hair, full and manageable.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Like the product was angry when I saw that it must be old stuff because it shrank in the container</li>
            <li> This is great holding product.  Not too sticky and give my hair great control.  I purchased a similar product when I could no longer find it in retail stores or at my salon, it does not compare.  I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> price much better on amazon than the salon, I have tried others but this is the best. I get a lot of complements on my hair!</li>
            <li> I like to use this product in my hair because it lets me style it without feeling/looking all greasy.  It is like I can&#x27;t tell it is in my hair after use, except it still holds.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can no longer find it in the salones or stores.  It gives your hair body, volume and shaping without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Plenty of hold for fairly short hair without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> love it. too bad they are discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> Before spraying my hair, I use this to hep finish my hair have the look I want.  It&#x27;s especially good for helping my hair in the back turn up, to hold it until I get it sprayed.</li>
            <li> OK but stuff I had before was better was sexy hair but not this one</li>
            <li> I absolutely heart this product. My whole life I have been told how different my hair is for a person of color. Before this product I was using conditioner and it was ok for the most part but after a while I could tell that over the years the conditioner has stripped my hair of its protein. I ended up cutting close to all of my hair off :(... Let me tell you this stuff isn&#x27;t called sexy for nothing. It works well with short curls or straight hair. Remember to buy it online the price is sooooo much better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Price was about half what salons charge.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this.  It works great for my short hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it dull like Redken Rewind does.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I have finer short hair and it leaves my hair a bit greasy looking. It barely leaves it looking piecy.</li>
            <li> Awesome and fast shipment..</li>
            <li> Have to have this for my hair to cooperate!! This price is good and all is right with the world again.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I love this product, it leaves my hair just like I want, not greasy or sticky, leaves hair beautifully.</li>
