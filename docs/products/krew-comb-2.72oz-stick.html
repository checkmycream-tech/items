            <li>If you have think hair and want it style and flexible all day, use this stuff as it is the best wax/hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>it smells good.</li>
            <li>I push my hair to the side and need a good hold in the wind and that stuff did the trick -</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;messy look&amp;#34; and plan on using this all over your hair, it&#x27;d probably be a good product, but didn&#x27;t work for my needs</li>
            <li>My boys love it!</li>
            <li>and I kind of like the smell.  </li>
            <li>so many pomades.</li>
            <li>what more can i say?</li>
            <li>oh there is one more thing....</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And, it looks better throughout the day, softening up but still staying where you want it.</li>
            <li>Not any more.  </li>
            <li>so easy.</li>
            <li>If you have a flattop or aren&#x27;t as particular as me about the pliability of the product or getting product on your hands, this will probably be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient because you don&#x27;t get your hands super sticky, okay....</li>
            <li>its cheap.</li>
            <li>My barber recommended this to me, and gave me some free samples to use.</li>
            <li>in fact, it smells rather good, like the products in the old barbershop.</li>
            <li>Great hold, doesn&#x27;t dry our his hair.</li>
            <li>Although I think that I could keep getting freebies from him, that just didn&#x27;t seem right for such a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy, but solid, and it does a great job at keeping my clippered hair crisp and in place, and to maximize the flatness of the \\&quot;deck\\&quot; of my haircut.</li>
            <li>It applies very easily with no mess.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell of you use too much.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the product is good for certain people, but it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.  </li>
            <li>A small amount works great to keep my flattop up all day, even thru humidity.</li>
            <li>Good product but a little too greasy</li>
            <li>Will last most of the day and doesn&#x27;t fell greasy or tacky.</li>
            <li>highly recommended if you have a squared-up, crisp flattop like mine.</li>
            <li>Only a little is needed for great hold.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for guys with flat tops that need a little coaxing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is hard to find in beauty supply store and real easy to find  when you spell it with a &amp;#34;K&amp;#34; and not a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Makes my flat top stand up all day long.</li>
            <li>It does hold more firmly, which is OK, but if I need to fix my hair for any reason I have to wet it down again.  </li>
            <li>First, it is much softer than the Tigi and leaves heavy streaks of wax in my hand that then need to be worked in by hand.  </li>
            <li>My wife introduced me to this product the first time she gave me a short high and tight flattop.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> so many pomades. so much disappointment. krew comb! let me break it down. its cheap. it smells good. it works. its all you need. it will not disappoint.  i&#x27;m not kidding. what more can i say? oh there is one more thing....i wanted to die when i could not find it at sallys anymore. but behold...amazon. so easy. yay!!!</li>
            <li> My son loves these for his flip! Great hold, doesn&#x27;t dry our his hair. Hard to find in stores :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Tigi Bed Head wax stick for about 7 years now.  I used to use and like the LA Looks wax stick, but I believe it is discontinued.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Tigi, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I use it on hair on my hair, which is 1\\&quot; at its shortest and 2 1/2\\&quot; at the longest.  While this is half the price, it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.  First, it is much softer than the Tigi and leaves heavy streaks of wax in my hand that then need to be worked in by hand.  With the Tigi, I never had to touch my hands and get the wax all over them.  Second, this isn&#x27;t as pliable as the Tigi when set.  It does hold more firmly, which is OK, but if I need to fix my hair for any reason I have to wet it down again.  One poster complained about the smell.  It does have a stronger smell than other products, but it reminds me of a barber shop and I kind of like the smell.  Also the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after applied.  Overall, I think the product is good for certain people, but it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.  If you have a flattop or aren&#x27;t as particular as me about the pliability of the product or getting product on your hands, this will probably be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> If you like your hair in a Sgt Carter style crew cut. This IS the stuff. I was told my hair would never work in a crew cut, with this stuff, it does.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time I used axe putty on my hair. I push my hair to the side and need a good hold in the wind and that stuff did the trick - but it was quite expensive. I found this Krew Comb stuff at my barber and gave it a try. This stuff works great and I have been using it ever since. I bought the stick because I travel a lot, and this stuff goes through security well. It meets the 3-1-1 requirement.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for guys with flat tops that need a little coaxing. Will last most of the day and doesn&#x27;t fell greasy or tacky.</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my flat top stand up all day long. Gels just don&#x27;t cut it. x. x. x.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient because you don&#x27;t get your hands super sticky, okay....but it&#x27;s not very effective for long-period holds. If you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;messy look&amp;#34; and plan on using this all over your hair, it&#x27;d probably be a good product, but didn&#x27;t work for my needs (I only wax the front of my hair)</li>
            <li> not much to say it works</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for to train my bread.</li>
            <li> If you have think hair and want it style and flexible all day, use this stuff as it is the best wax/hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Product larger than expected in size but hey...you can take it on a plane!</li>
            <li> A small amount works great to keep my flattop up all day, even thru humidity.</li>
            <li> We are regular purchasers of this product!  My boys love it!</li>
            <li> My barber recommended this to me, and gave me some free samples to use. Although I think that I could keep getting freebies from him, that just didn&#x27;t seem right for such a great product. It&#x27;s non-greasy, non-slick; it just works to hold your hair so that it stays where you want it. And, it looks better throughout the day, softening up but still staying where you want it. Now that I use it, I couldn&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
            <li> Only a little is needed for great hold. Strong smell of you use too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find in beauty supply store and real easy to find  when you spell it with a &amp;#34;K&amp;#34; and not a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;. It works great.</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this product the first time she gave me a short high and tight flattop. It isn&#x27;t oversmelly...in fact, it smells rather good, like the products in the old barbershop. It&#x27;s not too greasy, but solid, and it does a great job at keeping my clippered hair crisp and in place, and to maximize the flatness of the \\&quot;deck\\&quot; of my haircut. highly recommended if you have a squared-up, crisp flattop like mine.</li>
            <li> Good product but a little too greasy</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and will continue to for years to come.  It applies very easily with no mess.  it leaves your hair styled, but flexible.  I have always had to drive to the store and stand in line at the register.  Not any more.  This is the SAME product they sell in the store but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
