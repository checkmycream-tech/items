            <li>WOW my skin feels soooo smooth!!</li>
            <li>I love how gentle this cleanser is on my face</li>
            <li>I have always had fairly oily skin, but maybe not oily enough for this product?</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t get much better on the ingredients side.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and although my skin is still shiny at times, it glows and feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It gives me a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I like exfoliating washes with a little more grit, but this is a very effective gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>This wash makes your skin smooth, the particles are not too large, so you can use it every day.</li>
            <li>This organic cleanser has very very fine micro beads that exfoliate the skin in a way that is exceptionally better than other exfoliates I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this on recommendation of a facialist and it&#x27;s been a great everyday cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to buy the product.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>Love how the exfoliating beads aren&#x27;t too rough on the face and the face feels refreshing after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I have been using this as my daily wash for about 7 years now - love it and feel clean without overdrying</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants a really natural product without all the chemicals they put in so many a product now a days.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has tiny beads which gives a good scrub and extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and my skin is brighter and softer.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>I bought this on the recommendation of my favorite local spa.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the beads definitely feel exfoliating but not too rough!&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot here in Phoenix, I sweat and my makeup melts into my skin all day.  </li>
            <li>I moved to a different climate and my skin became more oily</li>
            <li>Bright green color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say what I love most.</li>
            <li>Truly keeps the face skin moist, clean and soft....</li>
            <li>Love this face wash and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>and it certainly doesn&#x27;t stop my monthly, hormonally-driven outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling so clean but never dry!</li>
            <li>However, you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, I have begun to use this whole product line and adore it.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>With this I use it once a day since it is gentle for every day</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Gentle but very noticeable exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but too gentle for me.  </li>
            <li>It cleans really well.</li>
            <li>That being said, it seems to be cleaning OK, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from a licensed carrier in the future.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find that it is particularly exfoliating</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend all the Eminence products</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Citrus Face Wash.  </li>
            <li>when i tried the samples, they did not say that they were for oily to normal skin.  </li>
            <li>It should be named the margarita facial scrub because it smells like fresh lime and the scrub</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>The concentration of exfoliating material in this wash is pretty low</li>
            <li>Remember, you only need a pea size amount for our entire face and neck which means this cleanser will last 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that it is very drying.</li>
            <li>addition to removing dead skin and polishing the face, it leaves it feeling smooth, hydrated and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily/combination with adult acne breakouts all the time.</li>
            <li>I was concerned to get such a small size, but you just need a tiny bit to wash your face, so I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past from Amazon and it was fine</li>
            <li>I still use my normal exfoliant (from Simple skincare) once a week.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use in tangent with a Clarisonic and can be used daily.  </li>
            <li>I am now obsessed with trying more products from this line!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper through Amazon than any other outlet.  </li>
            <li>I had a little break out when I first started using this, but I&#x27;m finding that my skin has fewer blackheads since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle for everyday scrubbing.</li>
            <li>After a full day, a small amount of this product goes a long way to remove the day&#x27;s schmutz from my face.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but too gentle for me.  </li>
            <li> It cleans really well.</li>
            <li> That being said, it seems to be cleaning OK, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from a licensed carrier in the future.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find that it is particularly exfoliating</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend all the Eminence products</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Citrus Face Wash.  </li>
            <li> when i tried the samples, they did not say that they were for oily to normal skin.  </li>
            <li> It should be named the margarita facial scrub because it smells like fresh lime and the scrub</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> The concentration of exfoliating material in this wash is pretty low</li>
            <li> Remember, you only need a pea size amount for our entire face and neck which means this cleanser will last 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that it is very drying.</li>
            <li> addition to removing dead skin and polishing the face, it leaves it feeling smooth, hydrated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily/combination with adult acne breakouts all the time.</li>
            <li> I was concerned to get such a small size, but you just need a tiny bit to wash your face, so I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past from Amazon and it was fine</li>
            <li> I still use my normal exfoliant (from Simple skincare) once a week.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use in tangent with a Clarisonic and can be used daily.  </li>
            <li> I am now obsessed with trying more products from this line!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper through Amazon than any other outlet.  </li>
            <li> I had a little break out when I first started using this, but I&#x27;m finding that my skin has fewer blackheads since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle for everyday scrubbing.</li>
            <li> After a full day, a small amount of this product goes a long way to remove the day&#x27;s schmutz from my face.</li>
            <li> I have used many other eminence products and never experienced this.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like the amount of exfoliation this product gives for the small amount I use each time.</li>
            <li> I use it every 2-3 days now but initially used everyday and it completely stopped my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have very dry skin, which I get in the winter time.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my makeup off, slightly exfoliates, keeps skin clear and doesn&#x27;t leave my it dry.</li>
            <li> It works without leaving your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days, but can definitely tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Even though they are pricey they last a long time because you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> but a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Like all Eminence products, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I only need a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> Small quantities are enough for exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li> The only small issue is sometimes the wash gets clogged.  </li>
            <li> it gets clogged a lot on the open/close tab, but aside from that, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Again, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Eminence products, this product is below average.</li>
            <li> watery,  I was informed by my aesthetician eminence sold on amazon or any where on the internet is a watered down version of the formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read on other Eminence product reviews that there are some knock-offs going around with missing safety seals.</li>
            <li> moreso, it helps fade out black spot and give a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> A few times I had to squeeze the bottle extra hard to get the wash to come out, and then a ton did resulting in waste.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little bit cheaper than what I would have paid in the salon.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying if you use it every day, but I usually switch between this product and a few other eminence products.  </li>
            <li> I have cleaned out the nozzle a few times because there appears to be a lot of dried wash in there.  </li>
            <li> It takes all the dead off</li>
            <li> I use this every night and this small bottle lasts me ages.</li>
            <li> My cosmetologist was skeptical when I said that I was using regular store-brand apricot scrub to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry, and i am concerned that this product is going to dry out my elderly skin badly.</li>
            <li> None irritating</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> The smell is faint</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great and gentle exfoliating for your face</li>
            <li> Excellent Exfoliate.  Have purchased more than once.  None irritating</li>
            <li> feels wonderful on my face. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my favorite local spa. It&#x27;s hard to say what I love most. The delivery was on time. The price is a little high for the amount in the bottle. However, you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I use about a pea sized amount and I don&#x27;t feel like I need more. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I do not rely exclusively on this to exfoliate. I still use my normal exfoliant (from Simple skincare) once a week.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle this cleanser is on my face</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this product, also it helps combination skin alot. try it, you wont regret it. moreso, it helps fade out black spot and give a glowing complexion. pls do not this discountinue this product .</li>
            <li> This Product Was Not sealed. Therefore you have no idea if this product was even what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician product junkie, always looking for something better out there. I am currently on my second bottle of this citrus scrub. I absolutely love it! The ingredient list is wonderful and short, leaving out all those nasty chemicals. I use this every night and this small bottle lasts me ages. I only need a small amount to do the job. It cleanses my makeup off, slightly exfoliates, keeps skin clear and doesn&#x27;t leave my it dry. I am now obsessed with trying more products from this line!</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my daily wash for about 7 years now - love it and feel clean without overdrying</li>
            <li> Love the Citrus Exfoliater Wash. It has micro granules and when applied to the skin i do feel like it is giving me a good exfoliation. The entire bottle lasts for a while. Small quantities are enough for exfoliating the face. I would highly recommend all the Eminence products</li>
            <li> This exfoliating wash smells AMAZING!  And it is the perfect consistency for my skin. Not a harsh exfoliant, but still very effective. And it is the perfect wash for the face first thing in the morning- helps to refresh and prepare the skin for the rest of the day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and love it.  Matter of fact, I have begun to use this whole product line and adore it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a really natural product without all the chemicals they put in so many a product now a days.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses this face soap.  He absolutely loves it.  I like it to to use every now and then when I want an exfoliating wash.  It gives me a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> watery,  I was informed by my aesthetician eminence sold on amazon or any where on the internet is a watered down version of the formula. I tested the wash to confirm this and it is in fact watery solution, does not help exfoliate , save your money !!!</li>
            <li> I can never remember to use a scrub when I only need to 3 times a week.  With this I use it once a day since it is gentle for every day use I keep it in my shower!</li>
            <li> My fabulous esthetician introduced me to Eminence products and I am hooked.  Great product and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to these products coming sealed and this one had no deal and seemed used. Is it safe to use??</li>
            <li> best face wash Ive ever used! it leaves your skin feeling so clean but never dry! and it smells great. I&#x27;ve bought this wash 4 times now, and can&#x27;t imagine switching to anything else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for several years, and it always has a delightful lime smell.  This latest bottle from Amazon smelled more like watered-down lemon, and it was in a plastic package, but the bottle had no safety seal. I&#x27;ve read on other Eminence product reviews that there are some knock-offs going around with missing safety seals. That being said, it seems to be cleaning OK, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from a licensed carrier in the future.</li>
            <li> Wonderful face wash.  Truly keeps the face skin moist, clean and soft....</li>
            <li> when i tried the samples, they did not say that they were for oily to normal skin.  my skin is dry, and i am concerned that this product is going to dry out my elderly skin badly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product! I had tried a sample of this and I liked it enough to buy the product. This cleanser has tiny beads which gives a good scrub and extra clean feeling. I love eminence products.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Eminence products, this product is below average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for about a month now and I LOVE it! I love all the Eminence products. It&#x27;s refreshing and makes my 35 year old skin look beautiful! I also use this with the coconut age moisturizer and the firming bamboo. I am a user for life!</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliating wash!  I have used it before, after purchasing it from the salon where I get facials.  It is a little drying if you use it every day, but I usually switch between this product and a few other eminence products.  The only small issue is sometimes the wash gets clogged.  A few times I had to squeeze the bottle extra hard to get the wash to come out, and then a ton did resulting in waste.  I have cleaned out the nozzle a few times because there appears to be a lot of dried wash in there.  I keep the lid snapped, so I do not know why it would get hardened.  I have used many other eminence products and never experienced this.  Overall, still it&#x27;s a great product and it was a little bit cheaper than what I would have paid in the salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have use don my face. This line is very good for your skin. Its organic and it really does the job. Leave my skin feelings clean and it also helps wake you up. This works on all skin types. A little can go a long way. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s got some scrubbing beads in it, smells great and seems to make my skin look fresher</li>
            <li> One of my favorite face washes! Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin after I wash with this.  Gentle but very noticeable exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the beads definitely feel exfoliating but not too rough!&lt;br /&gt;Was introduced to this product when i recieved a facial and i started using it with a clarisonic brush.. WOW my skin feels soooo smooth!!</li>
            <li> Works great for oils skin and smells wonderful.  I have also found that this works great for the underarm area and keeping it from smelling.  I used this when I was camping once and was suprise how well it got rid of the stink.  I even left some of it on my underarms.  Now I use it in the shower all the time.  I find it best to leave on the skin for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves my skin feeling clean without drying.  I like the exfoliation as well.  Expensive but a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Another fantastic Eminence product.. and Eminence never disappoints so that makes sense. It works really well. Especially if you have very dry skin, which I get in the winter time. It takes all the dead off and then you can top it off with some moisturizer and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this exfoliator. I use it every 2-3 days now but initially used everyday and it completely stopped my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product for years now that would even my skin tone.  This wash does it!  It&#x27;s very gentle and my skin is brighter and softer.  This is the one!</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing face wash but I don&#x27;t find that it is particularly exfoliating and it certainly doesn&#x27;t stop my monthly, hormonally-driven outbreaks.  The concentration of exfoliating material in this wash is pretty low so I don&#x27;t find it to improve exfoliation over simply washing with my Clarisonic.  I also don&#x27;t prefer it over a wash that foams.  It&#x27;s gentle but too gentle for me.  It&#x27;s hot here in Phoenix, I sweat and my makeup melts into my skin all day.  I need a stronger face wash.</li>
            <li> Another awesome, all natural product by Eminence!  It smells so yummy, and it acts as both an astringent and exfoliant.  Like all Eminence products, a little goes a long way.  Gentle enough to use in tangent with a Clarisonic and can be used daily.  I highly recommend the Citrus Face Wash.  Your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> I moved to a different climate and my skin became more oily so I decided to give this product a try. It works without leaving your skin feeling dry. Great cleanser!!&lt;br /&gt; I have been using Eminance products for many years. Even though they are pricey they last a long time because you only need a very small amount. It smells great too!!</li>
            <li> Gross lemony scent. Bright green color. Not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily skin</li>
            <li> Love this face wash and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Found Eminence when I went to a spa and now I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser a couple of times a week as my nighttime routine. After a full day, a small amount of this product goes a long way to remove the day&#x27;s schmutz from my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  It was recommended to me by my aesthetician; I&#x27;ve been using for over three years on a daily basis.  It is great for normal to oily skin.  Much cheaper through Amazon than any other outlet.  I will definitely order again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past from Amazon and it was fine but this time I&#x27;m not so sure!&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no seal on the actual bottle&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is faint&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the original one&lt;br /&gt;4. I remember this product being having a lot more scrub in it&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this and purchasing all my products from a reputable seller</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I would recommend anything organic!</li>
            <li> Anything by this brand is wonderful. Very gentle for everyday scrubbing. Smells great as well! Again, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product. My only issue with it is that it is very drying. I have always had fairly oily skin, but maybe not oily enough for this product? I have to put 2 layers of moisturizer on. I think if you have very oily skin, this product is probably perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, it smells amazing (like fresh limes). And you really can&#x27;t get much better on the ingredients side.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. My face feels so refreshed after I wash with it. My only complain is the it gets clogged a lot on the open/close tab, but aside from that, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love these products and ingredients by Eminence. I like exfoliating washes with a little more grit, but this is a very effective gentle exfoliator. The lime is invigorating in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great daily exfoliant, great fresh smell and leaves your skin smooth and soft!  Highly recommend this great product! You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> This exfoliating cleanser is outstanding. Not only does it smell great, but it is not overbearing or synthetic. This organic cleanser has very very fine micro beads that exfoliate the skin in a way that is exceptionally better than other exfoliates I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to removing dead skin and polishing the face, it leaves it feeling smooth, hydrated and refreshed. Remember, you only need a pea size amount for our entire face and neck which means this cleanser will last 6 months or more. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Really good face wash. It cleans really well. Also great for removing make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days, but can definitely tell a difference in my skin. I really like the amount of exfoliation this product gives for the small amount I use each time.</li>
            <li> perfect for my skin--i do not have sensitive skin. i use it in the shower every day to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Love how the exfoliating beads aren&#x27;t too rough on the face and the face feels refreshing after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to monitor its effect.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. Very gentle and i also yse it as scrab.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on recommendation of a facialist and it&#x27;s been a great everyday cleanser. It should be named the margarita facial scrub because it smells like fresh lime and the scrub is salt like. I had a little break out when I first started using this, but I&#x27;m finding that my skin has fewer blackheads since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this cleaned my face well without over drying it. It&#x27;s a light exfoliator and it has a refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I have very oily skin and although my skin is still shiny at times, it glows and feels so smooth! Will definetly be ordering more products...</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products! My cosmetologist was skeptical when I said that I was using regular store-brand apricot scrub to exfoliate. So I decided to try this one. My skin is oily/combination with adult acne breakouts all the time. This wash makes your skin smooth, the particles are not too large, so you can use it every day. I was concerned to get such a small size, but you just need a tiny bit to wash your face, so I love it!</li>
            <li> Love how well it cleans skin and exfoliates! I use with the lime tonique and my skin looks so amazing!</li>
