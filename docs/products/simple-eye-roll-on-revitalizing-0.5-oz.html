            <li>However, the product does feel great.</li>
            <li>Great product it did take about the puffiness of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It works just great.</li>

            <li>He looks great and his eyes look healthy!</li>
            <li>It is a good price and lasts the day through.  </li>
            <li>Feels good when applying</li>
            <li>I do prefer the eye roller by garnier, but this one is almost as good.</li>
            <li>Good for reducing bags under the eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Roller ball is good for under eye massage.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I gave this a try!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a great difference in the appearance of my under-eyes, but it does feel really good and the coolness helps wake me up!</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>(Which is so nice</li>
            <li>The roller-ball has a nice cooling effect on the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I couldn&#x27;t honestly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and works really good for the price.</li>
            <li>This product is better and easier (for me) than eye cream.  </li>
            <li>so it feels even better, I guess.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t hurt any more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with buying a product that allows you to dab on the cream.</li>
            <li>It feels like aloe going on your skin, the coolness of it is mostly from the metal ball that rolls when you apply.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t use it any more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now, and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this roll on eye support as I call it.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the eye roller, so I just roll some of this on the top of my hand and tap it around my eyes with my ring finger.</li>
            <li>I preferred in a tube but can&#x27;t get it any more.</li>
            <li>I WILL GET MORE.</li>
            <li>it is such a perfect no-leak applicator.</li>
            <li>The metal roller is really refreshing too.</li>
            <li>I learned of this product on the Environmental Working Group website and love how healthy and clean it is.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and not get IN your eyes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve just been fine, and since I tend to want to have a really easy regimen for my skin, I&#x27;ve never bothered to add it into my regimen.</li>
            <li>This is a FABULOUS product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using it, months later, and it feels great.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 weeks, consistently, on clean skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neat how cool the roller feels.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in a cool area</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes looking shiny or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple</li>
            <li>Product is soothing without being gummy or tacky &amp; absorbs quickly..  </li>
            <li>You basically just apply it underneath your eyes and it applies a quick burst of energy, or so it feels.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well and exceeded my expectations - especially on how quickly it moisturized my eyelids and took away the flaky feel and texture.</li>
            <li>This Simple eye roller has worked just fine and is much more affordable.  </li>
            <li>The metal roller ball on the tip of it feels amazing and cools my skin instantly.</li>
            <li>and I immediately look more alive.</li>
            <li>This Simple Eye Roll-On is pretty good, although i havent noticed too much of a difference in the morning when my eyes are the puffiest.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the little steel roller ball feels cool to the touch, so it feels good as you roll it on.</li>
            <li>and I put this on right away,</li>
            <li>Works good, when ball is cold feels good around the eye.  </li>
            <li>I have my favorite eye products to combat the tired look, but I&#x27;m always happy to try something new.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for one to soothe your eyes in the morning without caffeine I would try this one OR if you have had issues with other eye products, this one is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I already use their facial washes and moisturizers and LOVE everything this brand stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel is clear and has a light</li>
            <li>Give it a few minutes and it is good underneath a bit of make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if it does everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it feels nice and cool and seems to reduce puffiness.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids were dry, scaly, and very itchy - most products would cause a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much for my eyes</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t help with any coloration, but it really isn&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice and revitalizing going on.</li>
            <li>It stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;roller ball\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t roll very well and applying circular motions under my eye (as is suggested in the instructions)</li>
            <li>The product does not release very well</li>
            <li>This product definitely earns its claim to be safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use this, it burns my eyes so much, which i don&#x27;t understand because everything inside is natural.</li>
            <li>but I guess it doesn&#x27;t mean all their products are good.</li>
            <li>All other products give me more puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, I love what the Simple brand is all about, and so finding something to nurture my eyes that has good vitamins and natural products with no perfumes, dyes, or harsh irritants.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly with the intention of reducing puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds to solve the constant bags under my eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to try this due to the low price, but I&#x27;m amazed how nice it is.</li>
            <li>Normally I use eye serums that are in the $20 to $40 price range.</li>
            <li>They say they notice a difference right away, especially when using it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>In this case...something new didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really decent under eye moisturizer for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Before I get into my thoughts on this product, let me first explain what compelled me to try this product from Simple.</li>
            <li>overall I didnt notice any difference in helping my puffy eyes and its pretty expensive/small to not make a difference.</li>
            <li>It works as well as higher priced similar product.</li>
            <li>I will admit I was a little hesitant to purchase this product at first because of the price, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it is TOTALLY worth every penny you spend on it</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I am 52 years old.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see a difference because I only have pronounced puffiness once in a while.</li>
            <li>On the third or fourth day of using it, the flakiness is totally gone and shows no sign of coming back - my eyelids are as smooth as ever!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my mom has these puffies under her eyes that we&#x27;ve used all kinds of products and natural remedies for, and they work, but not as well as she&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SOFT ON MY SKIN</li>
            <li>It works as well as some of the more expensive ones which I also use but the application of this roll on is quick and simple when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>Then, it dries tight on the eyes, so when I smile I actually look 5 years OLDER!  </li>
            <li>This feels cool when you apply it, and the roller applicator eliminates waste.</li>
            <li>First, you have to squeeze pretty hard to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>The major differnce between this one and the one by garnier is that garnier has caffeine.</li>
            <li>generally I have no puffiness unless I&#x27;ve eaten a ton of salt.</li>
            <li>love the cooling effect of the roller-ball and the product, but the slight burning never went away after a few uses, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much sleep I&#x27;ve had, I can be cursed with bags, dark circles, puffiness or any combination of the three.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel it did anything to combat my puffiness or dark circles--which is what I really want in an eye product.</li>
            <li>Nothing bad or good to report.</li>

            <li> So we tried this, and it did help smooth out her puffies, but it wasn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;wow, what a difference&amp;#34; very subtle</li>
            <li> I recently started getting minor puffiness&lt;br /&gt;underneath</li>
            <li> I bought this eye roller to use on my 8 year old son who develops very dark shiners at different times of the year because of allergies.  </li>

            <li> but it just rolled on, dried and left no&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use it multiple times a day and after I apply it my kids think I have been crying because I guess I goop it on.</li>
            <li> On the minus side, I didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable reduction of the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d tried rubbing a little Jojoba oil and while it did help, it never completely fixed the problem and my eyelids would get dry again.</li>
            <li> But, for the past several months, my eyelids have gotten really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to reduce or prevent wrinkles - there are other products for that, and this one does not make that claim.  </li>

            <li> and frankly if anything states, implies or otherwise represents that it CAN reverse a hereditary condition like my dark circles</li>
            <li> Reduce puffiness and dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> week I&#x27;m battling puffiness and dark</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why some of you are knocking this for not helping with dark circles because I don&#x27;t see anything in the descriptive info that says it helps with dark circles.</li>
            <li> within 20 minutes they puffiness has gone down.  </li>
            <li> The formula is slightly thicker than Clinique&#x27;s and dries faster.  </li>
            <li> So if you try and press too hard to get it to roll, that pressure is not good for the sensitive skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t see any reduction of puffiness or discoloration, and after some time, I began to feel that the product is even a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found very few products that do not irritate my skin, and when my latest product started irritating it, I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t burn once, and my skin cleared up within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I had a coupon at Walgreens a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It is cold to your face but not sure it is doing anything else, so therefore not sure worth the money</li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of $11</li>
            <li> Only puffiness and tired eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and it might be just because the coolness on my face helps wake me up.</li>
            <li> I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> However, I found it on amazon.com via Subscribe &amp; Save and was paying HALF that!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any reduction in dark circles either - and my kids have woken me up a lot lately the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The other products made it worse and I was no longer hopeful for a cure when I saw this at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes that it would reduce the puffiness and darkness around my eyes; the puffiness/darkness around my eyes is not that bad, as I am still fairly young, but I like to take care of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh, the feeling of cucumber after a tired night.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for me and makes me look worse.  </li>
            <li> causes redness and makes my eyes look worse.</li>
            <li> is absolutely false.  </li>
            <li> While they were still a little flaky, they weren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> I had been using the Clinique eye roller, but it was very expensive and burned his eyes twice.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product so far.  I need to use it awhile longer to see how it performs.  so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old.  I bought this for $10 at Walmart.  I bought it mainly with the intention of reducing puffiness around my eyes.  I keep it in the fridge to optimize the \\&quot;chill factor\\&quot;.  Every morning, I apply this to under my eyes and the sides.  It does the job that I expect it to do which is reduce puffiness.  I don&#x27;t expect it to diminish dark circles - it&#x27;s not intended for that and frankly if anything states, implies or otherwise represents that it CAN reverse a hereditary condition like my dark circles is absolutely false.  I don&#x27;t expect it to reduce or prevent wrinkles - there are other products for that, and this one does not make that claim.  It&#x27;s great used as intended.</li>
            <li> the metal ball feels great but it didn&#x27;t do much for my eyes</li>
            <li> Very effective, inexpensive and easy to apply!! Reduce puffiness and dark eye circles. I recommend it for any signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using Simple Facial Wash and Simple Hydrating Cream I apply a little bit of Simple Revitalizing Eye Roll On.  This product is better and easier (for me) than eye cream.  It is a good price and lasts the day through.  Give it a few minutes and it is good underneath a bit of make-up.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as intended.  I always wake up with puffy eyes and I put this on right away, within 20 minutes they puffiness has gone down.  Won&#x27;t help with any coloration, but it really isn&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li> I used the entire tube and I have noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> Oh, the feeling of cucumber after a tired night.  I simply roll it on and the relief is instant!</li>
            <li> This is a FABULOUS product.  I was sent this in the mail via my Birchbox subscription and when I tried to buy it again at Walgreens I was bummed that it cost like $13.00 (considering it is a drugstore product).  However, I found it on amazon.com via Subscribe &amp; Save and was paying HALF that!  I have since bought this product for friends and family and everyone of them RAVES about this product.  They say they notice a difference right away, especially when using it in the morning.  I am on my second tube of this and will continue to buy it until I am turned onto something newer!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see a difference because I only have pronounced puffiness once in a while. However, the product does feel great. It&#x27;s neat how cool the roller feels. I keep mine in a cool area so it feels even better, I guess. The product absorbs quickly without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> Before I get into my thoughts on this product, let me first explain what compelled me to try this product from Simple. I&#x27;ve never really had to do anything to my eyelids - haven&#x27;t used lotions, creams, serums. They&#x27;ve just been fine, and since I tend to want to have a really easy regimen for my skin, I&#x27;ve never bothered to add it into my regimen. But, for the past several months, my eyelids have gotten really dry and flaky. It varies, but some days my eyelids would get so dry that they would literally hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d tried rubbing a little Jojoba oil and while it did help, it never completely fixed the problem and my eyelids would get dry again. So I decided to give Simple&#x27;s Revitalizing Eye Roll-On a try. I already use their facial washes and moisturizers and LOVE everything this brand stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am SO glad I gave this a try! It works amazingly well and exceeded my expectations - especially on how quickly it moisturized my eyelids and took away the flaky feel and texture. I use it in the morning and at night, when I put on my moisturizer, and the next day I could already tell a difference in my eyelids. While they were still a little flaky, they weren&#x27;t as bad and they didn&#x27;t hurt any more. On the third or fourth day of using it, the flakiness is totally gone and shows no sign of coming back - my eyelids are as smooth as ever! (Which is so nice -- it was a nightmare trying to apply eyeshadow on lids that were flaking!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I give this Revitalizing Eye Roll-On two BIG thumbs up! As I mentioned above, I love what the Simple brand is all about, and so finding something to nurture my eyes that has good vitamins and natural products with no perfumes, dyes, or harsh irritants. The metal roller ball on the tip of it feels amazing and cools my skin instantly. I will admit I was a little hesitant to purchase this product at first because of the price, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it is TOTALLY worth every penny you spend on it and I plan on repurchasing this item for years to come!n on repurchasing this item for years to come!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a difference in my face and the roller ball sticks sometimes.  You&#x27;re better off with buying a product that allows you to dab on the cream.</li>
            <li> Tightens my under eye bags. I apply this every morning and I immediately look more alive. I don&#x27;t even want to know how I looked before this product.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Easy to apply and not get IN your eyes.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much sleep I&#x27;ve had, I can be cursed with bags, dark circles, puffiness or any combination of the three.  I have my favorite eye products to combat the tired look, but I&#x27;m always happy to try something new.  In this case...something new didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I&#x27;m battling puffiness and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Revitalizing Eye Roll on comes in a green tube with a clear cap that unscrews to reveal a silver roller-ball.  The gel is clear and has a light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is applied by rolling the ball around your eye area.  The roller-ball has a nice cooling effect on the eye area.  But for me, this cooling effect is followed by a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to look closely to see that product was actually applied.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes looking shiny or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple suggests storing the Eye Roll On in the refrigerator for an added cooling effect.  I don&#x27;t do this for two reasons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I don&#x27;t want to walk to the kitchen twice a day to get my eye product.  (I&#x27;m working on streamlining my morning routine, not adding to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s cooling enough for me without the added refrigeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this Eye Roll didn’t reduce puffiness, it was instantly cooling…for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cooling effect of the roller-ball and the product, but the slight burning never went away after a few uses, so I stopped using it. I also didn&#x27;t feel it did anything to combat my puffiness or dark circles--which is what I really want in an eye product.</li>
            <li> This product definitely earns its claim to be safe for sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve found very few products that do not irritate my skin, and when my latest product started irritating it, I was desperate.  My eyelids were dry, scaly, and very itchy - most products would cause a burning sensation.  This product didn&#x27;t burn once, and my skin cleared up within a few days.  Amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it, months later, and it feels great.</li>
            <li> It feels like aloe going on your skin, the coolness of it is mostly from the metal ball that rolls when you apply. overall I didnt notice any difference in helping my puffy eyes and its pretty expensive/small to not make a difference. I will not be purchasing this produect again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, it burn your eye&lt;br /&gt;I use it for one time only and I can&#x27;t use it any more</li>
            <li> I rarely use this, it burns my eyes so much, which i don&#x27;t understand because everything inside is natural. I would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product it did take about the puffiness of my eyes.  My daugther recommend it and I thought it wasnt going to work but it is a very good pruduct</li>
            <li> I like this eye roll on. It works as well as some of the more expensive ones which I also use but the application of this roll on is quick and simple when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> Product is soothing without being gummy or tacky &amp; absorbs quickly..  It works as well as higher priced similar product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE!!! I notice a difference in my skin almost immediately! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now, and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> great cooling gel!!!!</li>
            <li> Feels good when applying but I don&#x27;t really notice and revitalizing going on.</li>
            <li> This feels cool when you apply it, and the roller applicator eliminates waste. However, I don&#x27;t see any reduction of puffiness or discoloration, and after some time, I began to feel that the product is even a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> Love this roll on eye support as I call it. It works just great. It stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> First, you have to squeeze pretty hard to get the product out.  So if you try and press too hard to get it to roll, that pressure is not good for the sensitive skin around the eyes.  Then, it dries tight on the eyes, so when I smile I actually look 5 years OLDER!  Not the point of this stuff at all.  I don&#x27;t see any reduction in dark circles either - and my kids have woken me up a lot lately the past few weeks.  This doesn&#x27;t do anything for me and makes me look worse.  I&#x27;m throwing it away - wish I kept my receipt so I could get my money back- I had a coupon at Walgreens a few weeks ago.  Should&#x27;ve just stuck to the simple face wipes- those are awesome - but I guess it doesn&#x27;t mean all their products are good.</li>
            <li> This Simple Revitalizing Eye Roll On did not work for me at all.  I have used it for 3 weeks, consistently, on clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;Although it does not irritate the skin around my eyes, it simply seems to do nothing.  I recently started getting minor puffiness&lt;br /&gt;underneath my eyes on some mornings and hoped this would work since it has cucumber but it just rolled on, dried and left no&lt;br /&gt;results of deflating my puffiness.  Nothing bad or good to report.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impress with it.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye roller to use on my 8 year old son who develops very dark shiners at different times of the year because of allergies.  I had been using the Clinique eye roller, but it was very expensive and burned his eyes twice.  In the end I felt it was unsafe to use on him.  This Simple eye roller has worked just fine and is much more affordable.  The formula is slightly thicker than Clinique&#x27;s and dries faster.  It has not burned or stung at all.  He looks great and his eyes look healthy!</li>
            <li> It is cold to your face but not sure it is doing anything else, so therefore not sure worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes that it would reduce the puffiness and darkness around my eyes; the puffiness/darkness around my eyes is not that bad, as I am still fairly young, but I like to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;roller ball\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t roll very well and applying circular motions under my eye (as is suggested in the instructions) causes redness and makes my eyes look worse. The product does not release very well so I tried pushing the ball in with my finger and squeezing some out so it would coat the \\&quot;roller ball\\&quot;. That works okay...all in all I think it was a waste of $11</li>
            <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s, with sensitive skin, crow&#x27;s feet and some crepiness under the eyes...generally I have no puffiness unless I&#x27;ve eaten a ton of salt. I also don&#x27;t have dark circles and I don&#x27;t know why some of you are knocking this for not helping with dark circles because I don&#x27;t see anything in the descriptive info that says it helps with dark circles. Only puffiness and tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to try this due to the low price, but I&#x27;m amazed how nice it is. Normally I use eye serums that are in the $20 to $40 price range. I love that this has no silicone as I&#x27;m prone to getting milia (those hard white bumps under the skin, not to be confused with acne). This has a lot of antioxidants, moisturizing ingredients, and even hydrogenated lupine protein, which can restructure and regenerate your skin. I don&#x27;t care for the eye roller, so I just roll some of this on the top of my hand and tap it around my eyes with my ring finger. It&#x27;s like a serum, not a cream. After using this only a week, I can tell a difference in the crepy skin being diminished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a great difference in the appearance of my under-eyes, but it does feel really good and the coolness helps wake me up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it does everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it feels nice and cool and seems to reduce puffiness.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and it might be just because the coolness on my face helps wake me up.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of different moisturizers after developing dry patches of skin around my eyes. The skin swells and turns red and will start to flake. The other products made it worse and I was no longer hopeful for a cure when I saw this at Walmart. I picked it up and within a couple of days the dry skin was gone. I do use it multiple times a day and after I apply it my kids think I have been crying because I guess I goop it on. If I stop using it the dry skin patches come back so I am now officially hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t take the puffiness away.  It had no affect on my eyelids at all.  Disappointed.  The end. Amen.</li>
            <li> my mom has these puffies under her eyes that we&#x27;ve used all kinds of products and natural remedies for, and they work, but not as well as she&#x27;d like. So we tried this, and it did help smooth out her puffies, but it wasn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;wow, what a difference&amp;#34; very subtle</li>
            <li> This is the best eye Revitalizer I&#x27;ve encountered yet. I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds to solve the constant bags under my eyes I&#x27;ve had for years. In addition, I keep this in the fridge overnight (best kept secret) and apply it every morning as it gives a cold sensation that wakes you up instantly. Highly suggest this for people who have constant bags under their eyes and have a hard time keeping their eyes open in the morning.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the eye roller by garnier, but this one is almost as good. The major differnce between this one and the one by garnier is that garnier has caffeine. If you are looking for one to soothe your eyes in the morning without caffeine I would try this one OR if you have had issues with other eye products, this one is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and no puffy eyes in the morning. All other products give me more puffy eyes. I preferred in a tube but can&#x27;t get it any more.</li>
            <li> Good for reducing bags under the eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I USE IT EVERYDAY I LIKE IT. IT&#x27;S SOFT ON MY SKIN NO BURNINGS NO RASH. I WILL GET MORE.</li>
            <li> This Simple Eye Roll-On is pretty good, although i havent noticed too much of a difference in the morning when my eyes are the puffiest. I like to keep it in the refrigerator so that it&#x27;s nice and cold when i apply it on my face. It feels so good! Takes a long time to dry under your eyes though.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product on the Environmental Working Group website and love how healthy and clean it is. I travel a lot and it is such a perfect no-leak applicator. The only issue is that it does dry a bit sticky but if you put face lotion on after you use this you&#x27;ll never notice!</li>
            <li> Works good, when ball is cold feels good around the eye.  easy to apply and works really good for the price.</li>
            <li> Roller ball is good for under eye massage. Formula does not seem to do anything</li>
            <li> Really decent under eye moisturizer for people with sensitive skin.  It won&#x27;t work any miracles, but if you&#x27;re just looking for something to keep the area from drying out, I&#x27;d recommend it.  The metal roller is really refreshing too.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. On the plus side, the little steel roller ball feels cool to the touch, so it feels good as you roll it on. On the minus side, I didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable reduction of the puffiness under my eyes. Bottom line, I couldn&#x27;t honestly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and it helps me to wake up a bit faster.  You basically just apply it underneath your eyes and it applies a quick burst of energy, or so it feels.</li>
