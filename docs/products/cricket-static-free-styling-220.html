            <li>excellent value.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Great brush!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>while the box it came in looked perfectly intact, the product itself was damaged.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a great price and it is just as it was described.</li>
            <li>it was making my hair fly away again.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a one time thing, but every time I tried to brush my hair it would fly out.</li>
            <li>So I was unsure if she would be happy with this one but bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is great.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully well on my baby-fine hair without causing static flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping the brush from the truck as it is still in relatively good shape.</li>
            <li>I bought one, loved it and bought another to keep in reserve in  case it is discontinued.  </li>
            <li>but after a couple of days using this one, I adjusted, and now I&#x27;m adept with this one, too.     </li>
            <li>combs hair nicely and goes through any tangles.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the way it was working with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled about getting this brush.</li>
            <li>I am more than thrilled with my purchase-</li>
            <li>But, Amazon is just so easy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to have found this brush.</li>
            <li>I had two of these hairbrushes that were wearing out after many years (guessing between 10 and 15 years) of use.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, and would give it five stars, but the piece that holds the bristles oftens falls off (out of)</li>
            <li>THIS IS A LIGHT WEIGHT BUT EFFECTIVE BRUSH</li>
            <li>This was the most reasonable of this type of brush that I could find, yet it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for 5 years and it is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>I Love these Brushes  and  bought  all they had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome brush that will last you many, many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>I recommend packaging it better</li>
            <li>but I love the metal bristles.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bothered contacting the because I would spend more on return shipping</li>
            <li>As for the brush, I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Static increases that problem, but the cricket static free brush prevents a lot of breakage and brushes every strand.</li>
            <li>So I bought this static free brush and it has reduced the static in my hair a lot.  </li>
            <li>and it still was static free and they are easy to clean .I</li>
            <li>Everyone should use  a comfortable  brush to stimulate  the  oil glands in their scalp  </li>
            <li>An excellent brush that is truly static free, comfortable to use, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I just love Cricket hair brushes as my hair tends to get static easily due to being very fine.  </li>
            <li>I could not find it in any store, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon for such a cheap price (think I paid $5 total which included shipping).</li>
            <li>I love using it so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it helps too much with static</li>
            <li>I even tried super gluing it to no avail.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s true since the brush itself didn&#x27;t hold a charge, but certainly charged my hair!</li>
            <li>I have somewhat long, fine hair that is prone to static.</li>
            <li>It works and is just the right weight.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; holding the pin popped right out of the handle.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush from a salon in high school ...</li>
            <li>Its rather difficult to find a brush with ball-tipped, metal bristles (or pins) and with a nicely balanced handle at a fair price.</li>
            <li>it is a nice quality brush, doesn&#x27;t create static, and I can tell it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and can dry and break easily.</li>
            <li>My wife first purchased one of these brushes at a salon in Bermuda 7 years ago, and has never purchased another type of hairbrush, since.  </li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>Because I am not sure where I&#x27;ll be able to find replacements in about a dozen years or more I picked up four this time.</li>
            <li>I had to hot glue it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This was our favorite brush for a long time and when they finally started to wear out we found them on Amazon for a great price, but while they look the same they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>and it was exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li>I would try this brush first over the twenty dollar ones..</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get a new hairbrush, and when I got this one I liked it so much</li>
            <li>I got this brush for my wife who has really long hair and can&#x27;t use one with plastic bristles because of the static build up.</li>
            <li>I just wish now that they would make a large 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li>so you dont have much to lose.</li>
            <li>The new brush is much stiffer and less flexible than the old one and doesn&#x27;t feel good going through my thinning hair or my wife&#x27;s much fuller head of hair.  </li>
            <li>round brush that is static free with the same bristles.</li>
            <li>This one is sturdy enough to do the job, but agile enough to section hair for styling.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Brush  to anyone &amp; everyone.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; type bristles are more densely spaced that other anti-static brushes so it actually captures most of the loose hairs as I brush instead of them ending up all over my clothes!  </li>
            <li>Waste of money, find a better product.</li>
            <li>This one was really cheap on the price; the other brush I found was closer to $20.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness that this brush is available through Amazon, because I was getting tired of spending several thousand dollars to travel to Bermuda every so many years to buy her a replacement (just kidding).  </li>
            <li>No more static in my hair.</li>
            <li>you will more likely find similar item, possibly cheaper priced in your supermarket.</li>
            <li>Seems sharper and less comfortable.</li>
            <li>These have nicely manufactured ball tips (so you don&#x27;t scratch your scalp) and are very secure in the cushioned base.</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t monsterously large or wide, so its very maneuverable for styling.</li>
            <li>The brush itself isn&#x27;t bad, but the whole reason I purchased this is the claim that it&#x27;s a static free brush.  </li>
            <li>I threw my old one out.</li>
            <li>I went to Target and tried to find a new one, but I could only find plastic bristles...</li>
            <li>My previous one had a contoured, slightly shaped handle with a more substantial feel (it&#x27;s no longer made *pout</li>
            <li>my parents really enjoy this brush, i guess they may be hard to find in stores?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped this brush would have as soft a tips as the last one.  </li>
            <li>Going to dedicate it for use on the cat; she really prefers this brush to any other brush we have tried.    </li>
            <li>I hate plastic bristles because they make my hair so full of static.</li>

            <li> Being your typical male that is all I require in the form of hair care.  </li>
            <li> its only a few bucks</li>
            <li> then I probably spent on the brush.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about at first was the handle - very flat, thin and straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite dense (thick), but of a medium texture (ie, not coarse) and long and wavy - prone to tangles.</li>
            <li> The other was in my vehicle to use when I got to work to loosen my hair and give it some body.</li>
            <li> A few of the red beads feel off the ends, leaving those bristles a little scratchy</li>
            <li> Either way, I would have wanted to keep this brush for a long time, but having it damaged first thing is just disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a rare case where I purchased from a secondary seller rather than from Amazon (MyBeautyWarehouse) because even with having to pay for the shipping it was less expensive than using Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> metal prongs that don&#x27;t bend/break easily and a firm cushion base.</li>
            <li> and they all start doing that after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> It was missing 2 pins.</li>
            <li> I checked in the box and the missing parts weren&#x27;t in it</li>
            <li> The brush had bristles missing and the ones still there had glue all around the bottom.</li>
            <li> She had been searching all the stores locally and was unable to find a brush with metal bristles.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> It serves well, the pins didn&#x27;t start falling out yet (after about 1/2 year of use) but the handle being flat is quite inconvenient to hold in my hand.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the brush can purchased at finer salon&#x27;s here in the states, as well.  </li>
            <li> However, I was afraid it would the &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; holding the pin would pop out of the handle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife first purchased one of these brushes at a salon in Bermuda 7 years ago, and has never purchased another type of hairbrush, since.  Thank goodness that this brush is available through Amazon, because I was getting tired of spending several thousand dollars to travel to Bermuda every so many years to buy her a replacement (just kidding).  Seriously, the brush can purchased at finer salon&#x27;s here in the states, as well.  But, Amazon is just so easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to have found this brush. Its rather difficult to find a brush with ball-tipped, metal bristles (or pins) and with a nicely balanced handle at a fair price. This brush isn&#x27;t monsterously large or wide, so its very maneuverable for styling. I no longer use brushes with molded plastic pins, because the mold marks along the side of the pin can scrape and damage your hair strands as you brush. I&#x27;ve seen a difference since I&#x27;ve switched to using only wire pins. However, not all wire pin brushes are created equal! These have nicely manufactured ball tips (so you don&#x27;t scratch your scalp) and are very secure in the cushioned base. Also, they&#x27;re well spaced (not like a wig brush) but sturdy. My hair is quite dense (thick), but of a medium texture (ie, not coarse) and long and wavy - prone to tangles. This brush is just what I was looking for to style my hair, either wet or dry. Plastic pin brushes just aren&#x27;t up to the task, but the larger, wider wire pin brushes are like using a baseball bat. This one is sturdy enough to do the job, but agile enough to section hair for styling.     The one thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about at first was the handle - very flat, thin and straight. My previous one had a contoured, slightly shaped handle with a more substantial feel (it&#x27;s no longer made *pout*) but after a couple of days using this one, I adjusted, and now I&#x27;m adept with this one, too.     Great brush. I&#x27;m actually going to order another to have on hand.</li>
            <li> rips our hair out and hurts my scalp, save yourmoney</li>
            <li> I had two of these hairbrushes that were wearing out after many years (guessing between 10 and 15 years) of use. I use one in the bathroom for use after getting out of the shower to straighten my hair. The other was in my vehicle to use when I got to work to loosen my hair and give it some body. Being your typical male that is all I require in the form of hair care.  After all these years the inside brush was starting to lose the protective beads on the ends of the bristles, while the bristles themselves were starting to rust. I&#x27;m keeping the brush from the truck as it is still in relatively good shape. Going to dedicate it for use on the cat; she really prefers this brush to any other brush we have tried.    An excellent brush that is truly static free, comfortable to use, and long lasting. Because I am not sure where I&#x27;ll be able to find replacements in about a dozen years or more I picked up four this time.</li>
            <li> combs hair nicely and goes through any tangles.  metal prongs that don&#x27;t bend/break easily and a firm cushion base. excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped this brush would have as soft a tips as the last one.  Not so.  Seems sharper and less comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, and would give it five stars, but the piece that holds the bristles oftens falls off (out of) the casing and you have to keep putting it back in,  I&#x27;ve had several of these and they all start doing that after a few months of use.  I even tried super gluing it to no avail.</li>
            <li> The brush itself isn&#x27;t bad, but the whole reason I purchased this is the claim that it&#x27;s a static free brush.  Maybe that&#x27;s true since the brush itself didn&#x27;t hold a charge, but certainly charged my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price and it is just as it was described. These were purchased to be used in a barber shop.</li>
            <li> No more static in my hair.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A LIGHT WEIGHT BUT EFFECTIVE BRUSH WHICH I BOUGHT FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON WHO HAS SEVERE ARTHRITIS AND IT IS PERFECT.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was using this brush one day and I liked the way it was working with my hair.  When I went to pay, they were selling the brush for somewhere around $15.  I talked myself out of it, thinking I don&#x27;t need another brush.  I looked it up on Amazon and it was under $5.  I bought one, loved it and bought another to keep in reserve in  case it is discontinued.  Great brush!</li>
            <li> you will more likely find similar item, possibly cheaper priced in your supermarket. It serves well, the pins didn&#x27;t start falling out yet (after about 1/2 year of use) but the handle being flat is quite inconvenient to hold in my hand.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair.  I bought this to use when drying my hair and trying to straighten it.  It works and is just the right weight.</li>
            <li> I had to hot glue it back together I did not want to get rid of it b/c it works so well.</li>
            <li> This brush us a must have in the winter. My hair is fine and can dry and break easily. Static increases that problem, but the cricket static free brush prevents a lot of breakage and brushes every strand.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and use Argon Oil Shampoo and Conditioner (which I buy on Amazon) and it helps but I could tell when I brushed my hair it was making my hair fly away again.  So I bought this static free brush and it has reduced the static in my hair a lot.  I use it to style my hair when I dry it and it works well.</li>
            <li> This was the most reasonable of this type of brush that I could find, yet it&#x27;s a great product.  Exactly what I wanted.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I had a wire-bristle brush from years ago that finally broke. I went to Target and tried to find a new one, but I could only find plastic bristles...I hate plastic bristles because they make my hair so full of static. I checked at Wal-Mart as well and couldn&#x27;t find anything there either, so I came online and checked at Amazon. This was one of the few that was reasonably priced. I am more than thrilled with my purchase- it is a nice quality brush, doesn&#x27;t create static, and I can tell it will last a long time. I came back and bought a second one to replace a second brush that was breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get a new hairbrush, and when I got this one I liked it so much I threw my old one out. Except this product broke two day later. The \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; holding the pin popped right out of the handle. I thought it was a one time thing, but every time I tried to brush my hair it would fly out. Waste of money, find a better product.</li>
            <li> my parents really enjoy this brush, i guess they may be hard to find in stores?</li>
            <li> Works well, gets the job done. So far, no static. Seems to be very well made. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just love Cricket hair brushes as my hair tends to get static easily due to being very fine.  But not with Cricket!  I just wish now that they would make a large 2&amp;#34; round brush that is static free with the same bristles.</li>
            <li> This was our favorite brush for a long time and when they finally started to wear out we found them on Amazon for a great price, but while they look the same they&#x27;re not.  The new brush is much stiffer and less flexible than the old one and doesn&#x27;t feel good going through my thinning hair or my wife&#x27;s much fuller head of hair.  They don&#x27;t make them like they used to...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for 5 years and it is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for years.  I finally took the time to see if I could purchase cheaper.  I did! That is why I bought 4.</li>
            <li> I Love these Brushes  and  bought  all they had.  Gave them as  Gifts  and my friends  are still thanking me.  Everyone should use  a comfortable  brush to stimulate  the  oil glands in their scalp  and it&#x27;s  relaxing.  I highly recommend this Brush  to anyone &amp; everyone.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush from a salon in high school ... maybe 12 years ago. A few of the red beads feel off the ends, leaving those bristles a little scratchy so I decided it was time to replace it. I could not find it in any store, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon for such a cheap price (think I paid $5 total which included shipping). It&#x27;s an awesome brush that will last you many, many years. I have somewhat long, fine hair that is prone to static. This doesn&#x27;t break my hair or leave it staticy.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love using it so much. My hair stylist uses the same brush on me and I had to have one at home!</li>
            <li> I use to have a cricket brush and it finally fell apart but i had it for 5 years and it still was static free and they are easy to clean .I only use cricket. I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled about getting this brush. However, I was afraid it would the &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; holding the pin would pop out of the handle but when i received the item it was already damaged. while the box it came in looked perfectly intact, the product itself was damaged. It was missing 2 pins. I checked in the box and the missing parts weren&#x27;t in it so i can only assume that it was shipped this way to begin with. But maybe it fell out of the box. Either way, I would have wanted to keep this brush for a long time, but having it damaged first thing is just disappointing. I recommend packaging it better (the box came in with 2 sheets of paper. literally, paper) and using some padding on the chance the brush go damaged in the process of being delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my wife who has really long hair and can&#x27;t use one with plastic bristles because of the static build up. She had been searching all the stores locally and was unable to find a brush with metal bristles. I saw this one and another on amazon. This one was really cheap on the price; the other brush I found was closer to $20. So I was unsure if she would be happy with this one but bought it anyway. Turns out she loves the brush and it was exactly what she needed. I would try this brush first over the twenty dollar ones..its only a few bucks so you dont have much to lose.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is great. I don&#x27;t think it helps too much with static but I love the metal bristles. My problem is with beauty time who I purchased from. The brush had bristles missing and the ones still there had glue all around the bottom. It&#x27;s still useable but it&#x27;s not what I paid for. I haven&#x27;t bothered contacting the because I would spend more on return shipping then I probably spent on the brush. Go to a store and buy it if you want one.</li>
            <li> This was a rare case where I purchased from a secondary seller rather than from Amazon (MyBeautyWarehouse) because even with having to pay for the shipping it was less expensive than using Amazon prime.  As for the brush, I LOVE it.  It works wonderfully well on my baby-fine hair without causing static flyaways.  As an added bonus, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; type bristles are more densely spaced that other anti-static brushes so it actually captures most of the loose hairs as I brush instead of them ending up all over my clothes!  I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between a styling brush and a sculpting brush, so I ordered one of each from the Cricket line.  I prefer this one and I will be buying another one to keep in the car.</li>
