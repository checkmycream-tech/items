            <li>don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin</li>

            <li>I ordered Sweet Almond,Wheat Germ, Avocado and 2 other oils.</li>
            <li>I am making a home made salt scrub for baby soft hands.</li>

            <li> Super good stuff. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The order arrived by the estimated date.I am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin but I have noticed changes that caused me to go looking for alternatives. My skin has accepted this oil with no negative reactions. The smell is pleasant and disappears when I mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> No smell, no taste and no problems using it.  I am making a home made salt scrub for baby soft hands.</li>
            <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t even say \\&quot;100% Pure and Organic\\&quot; (not even in the fine print, which I don&#x27;t even think MY bottle had a fine print) The label was clearly printed over another label and the fluid ounce # was scratched off &amp; corrected with a black pen.

            <li> Love this oil it made my hair really soft and came with a changeable top for pouring or just control pouring. It is a plus, i still have Alot left.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t ordered and will not.  It is clear that this bottle and product--though the pictures display different organizations--is the same exact source as this product that has terrible reviews. [[ASIN:B004XERFZW Sweet Almond Oil 100 Organic]]  The producers are reviled as scam-artists and the product as bogus.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy from this vendor SaaQin Inc./ Halaleveryday - Their products are bogus. I ordered 5 different oils I sat them on the table and my 15yr old son said are these all the same oils with different labels? I ordered Sweet Almond,Wheat Germ, Avocado and 2 other oils. Sure enough I opened them all up and they were all the same color same smell (no smell) and exact consistency. How can they all be of the same exact consistency. They all seemed like a cheap baby oil with color added. I took them to my friend who is a chemical analysis @ Avomeen Analytical and sure enough he said all the bottles held the same exact content which was a very light mineral oil &amp; a color extract. Of course the labels are fake as well as the bar codes do not compute. I called to try and get them returned they never answered my messages. BUYER BEWARE!!!  SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, GREAT product! Very nice, mild oil for mixing with other products. I would definitely buy it again. Overall good experience.</li>
            <li> The bottle that the oil was contained in was scratched and looked used. I also found fibers and black particles floating in the oil. GROSS, and will NOT be ordering from this seller again. I have reordered from a different seller.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the clarity of the oil and the feel of it. I am happy with this product and when I am ready for more I will go back to this company to get it.</li>

            <li> This product arrived very fast. I love not having to wait for forever for my order to arrive. The smell of this product isn&#x27;t really strong. Its quite mild but I really like it. I use it on my hair. I&#x27;m natural and need products that really penetrate. It works really well.</li>
            <li> Great product that adds sheen and protects hair from heat damage. Great non-greasy oil for the skin, and feet.After reviewing several products, this is the best yet. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> it is ok, but every time I wax and use it when I finish I still have a lot of irritation pimples. I was expecting better results from an organic product.</li>
            <li> Nice product. FAST ship! Was happy it came with the top sealed nice and tight. Mixed it with my essential oils, worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved is very good thanks.</li>
