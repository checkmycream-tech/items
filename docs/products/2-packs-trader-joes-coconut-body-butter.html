            <li> Was not near a trader joe&#x27;s to buy so ordering was a snap.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and thick.</li>
            <li> A Jar lasted me about 9 mos... not to say everyone will get that time frame out of it, because I don&#x27;t use every single day...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing without the greasy feeling of other products.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying the other flavors.</li>
            <li> and I find that it helps keep the redness down and keeps it from getting all flaky as well.</li>
            <li> TJ&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra crap other brands put in their products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my order arrived too late</li>
            <li> I was breaking out on my face really bad</li>

            <li> I purchased it thinking that is was natural and/organic but it has way more ingredients than I expected. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I will try it.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this stuff. I just don&#x27;t like the price all that much. Within a weeks worth of use, my skin is noticibly softer.</li>
            <li> I buy this from my local trader Joe&#x27;s and it is utterly amazing and much cheaper from the store at $5 a jar I believe. If you love the smell of creamy coconut this is perfect!  It smells good enough to eat! Very moisturizing as well and being from TJ&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra crap other brands put in their products.</li>

            <li> The best body butter....love the coconut....</li>
            <li> I love this body butter. Unfortunately my order arrived too late and I could not take it with me while abroad on vacation. But. i can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> Trader joes coconut body butter is awesome the smell is great it feels wonderful will buy it again over and over</li>
            <li> It was okay. I still have an entire container left out of the bundle after having it for four months. I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it. The texture and smell did not do anything for me. I may give the second one away in a gift basket. It is not horrible, I just personally did not love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this item!!  It really does moisturize well without being greasy.  I will be buying more.  I&#x27;ve even used it on the ends of my hair and it works nicely!!</li>
            <li> smells and feels wonderful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, thick lotion.  It&#x27;s not a butter. Very strong coconut smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found in many years. I am addicted to the light and non greasy texture and the smell. I am looking forward to trying the other flavors.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Was not near a trader joe&#x27;s to buy so ordering was a snap.  Bought some for my friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> I love this cream .I use it on my face helps with softening wrinkles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and non greasy. I can put it on and have smooth skin for days, so I don&#x27;t have to continue putting it on all the time. A Jar lasted me about 9 mos... not to say everyone will get that time frame out of it, because I don&#x27;t use every single day... but, it did last me a long time and I liked it so much, I bought two more jars.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells delicious, like a sweet yummy frosting(so if that isn&#x27;t your thing probably should not buy this). Very creamy and thick. A little goes a long ways. I have psoriasis and I find that it helps keep the redness down and keeps it from getting all flaky as well. It soaks in without leaving a greasy feeling. The sweet smell does disappear after a little while so no fear if you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a sweet cup cake all day.</li>
