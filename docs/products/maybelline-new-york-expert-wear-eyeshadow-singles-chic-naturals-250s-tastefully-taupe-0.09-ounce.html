            <li>Maybelline Chic Naturals in Tastefully Taupe is my favorite eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I love that the chic naturals has so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to find this product, Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Singles, on Amazon as I can&#x27;t find it in the stores in my area anymore.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light shimmer and doesn&#x27;t build up in the creases, looks great all day long</li>
            <li>This particular color is fairly pigments and not too powdery.</li>
            <li>It is the exact color that it looks on here, but when you try applying it, the product comes out very light in color.</li>
            <li>I really like that it can pair with warm or cool palettes.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks pretty all day.  </li>
            <li>This eye shadow has a great consistency and slight shimmer.</li>
            <li>The Maybelline Expert Wear eyeshadows are by far my favorite drug store brand of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cool color to pair with grey and a kohl eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li>so I ordered from Amazon to get the exact product I needed.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you expect</li>
            <li>Delivery of this product was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>MUCH lighter than it looks in the container.</li>
            <li>I like the tastefully taupe color but have found many other products that I like just as much.</li>
            <li>Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with outher close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes.</li>
            <li>The color is perfectly natural and looks great by itself or as a base on your eyelid with another accent color in the crease of your eye.  </li>
            <li>Case was a little scrathed but shipping was fast</li>

            <li> I like the fact that this eyeshadow comes in a SINGLE, and that I don&#x27;t have to buy one container with several different colors just to get the ONE color that I want.  </li>
            <li> I live in a small town and the merchants here did not have this product</li>
            <li> This looks very classy with pale skin, brown eyes, brown eye liner, and black mascara.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time or expense to return it.  </li>
            <li> I always throw out the applicators eye shadow comes with and use a small damp makeup brush to apply it, pat moisture with fingertips, and blend it all out with slightly lager dry brush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that such a simple transaction could get goofed up.  </li>

            <li> great color. looks good on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; color for my skin.

This eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t create crease lines on or around my eyes and I have used this for many years. Delivery of this product was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Case was a little scrathed but shipping was fast</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to my eye shadow collection. It serves well as a medium shade over the lid for darker, smokey eye looks, or as the darker shade in the crease for a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; look. I really like that it can pair with warm or cool palettes.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you expect</li>
            <li> beautiful brown..wear it all the time..love it and all maybelline eyeshadow..great price..</li>

            <li> MUCH lighter than it looks in the container. It is the exact color that it looks on here, but when you try applying it, the product comes out very light in color.</li>

            <li> Love this eyeshadow, easy to apply, nice shimmer to it. It stays even for hours, no running into creases. It goes with every eye color, too.</li>
            <li> GREAT color for women with salt &amp; pepper.  Blends perfectly.</li>
