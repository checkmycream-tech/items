            <li>This is a rose perfume oil.</li>

            <li>The rose scent is overbearing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nice to me.</li>
            <li>wonderful scent and fast shipping</li>
            <li>This was bought by my sister on my account (she doesn&#x27;t have one of her own).</li>
            <li>So my sister had to go get some of her own.  </li>
            <li>this rose oil smells</li>
            <li>I wanted something that smells like a rose .  </li>
            <li>This is pachouli and smells nothing at all like a rose.</li>
            <li>I received this hoping for a nice rosey smell based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells like rose and burnt rubber.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful rose smell, it couldn&#x27;t smell closer to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am a rose lover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this brand, Auric Blends, by a friend who came to work smelling so nice.</li>
            <li>and evelyn rose</li>
            <li>is the best rose Ive found so far..</li>
            <li>Very Strong scent of Roses</li>
            <li>Its very strong.</li>
            <li>If you love rose scent</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of rose, and based on these reviews</li>
            <li>others have stated, it&#x27;s potent and gets even stronger once your skin has had a chance to warm it</li>
            <li>I love catching whiffs of myself all day wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, this one was surprisingly strong!</li>
            <li>This did not smell like roses, it smelt strongly of soap!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of roses, and I LOVE the smell of this rose perfume oil.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best rose fragrance I have ever come across.  </li>
            <li>Nice, clean rose.  </li>
            <li>I love this amber scent and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>but I love that they don&#x27;t change on my skin.</li>
            <li>Their Love scent is my fave,  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the purity and beauty of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this scent than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li>you are looking for something more exotic, layer this on with another scent and try your hand at the art of perfumery.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliment when wearing it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get exactly what you&#x27;re asking for... and you will smell just like a rose!</li>
            <li>She bought me a bottle of the Love scent</li>
            <li>and I have thoroughly enjoyed that one as well.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly love this product</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t love the smell of this oil, but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>(good thing I was going to take a shower right after).</li>
            <li>While it does have a nice rose scent (anyone will know that it&#x27;s a classic rose)</li>
            <li>The oil evaporates quickly, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Ive been intersted in finding a rose oil perfume and this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>A lovely, crisp rose perfume.</li>
            <li>Fabulous fragrance at a more than acceptable price.</li>
            <li>Smell is awesome but kind of smells like baby powder not rose</li>
            <li>so go easy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really strong, and over-bearing.</li>
            <li>I like more musky \\&quot;spicy\\&quot;, oriental or sweet smells.</li>
            <li>The rose smell is great, but very strong, so I advise only wearing a dab if you are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quick shipping, but it smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I also bought this as a gift for my other rose loving friend, and she also agreed... smells just like roses!</li>
            <li>wonderful little roll on bottle</li>
            <li>This is the same rose scent that you probably smelled in your grandmother&#x27;s powder or rose scented soap.  </li>
            <li>The price was awesome, shipping was super fast, and I will definitely order again and again!!!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, a really strong, vibrant rose scent that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>This amber has a fantastic scent that is exactly right in strength!  </li>
            <li>My husband tells me it reminds him of the day we were married where there were huge wild rose bushes all around us!</li>
            <li>Oh well you win some you loose some.</li>
            <li>Very authentic and intense rose scent that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Very feminine-Not overwhelming though.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this oil, but when I wear it, it is very overpowering.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Better for older women.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>The scent is classic, clean, and strong.</li>
            <li>There is nothing particularly exotic or alluring about it, but if you are looking for a nice quality, budget friendly, long lasting, very distinctively ROSE perfume oil</li>
            <li>Normally I love Rose but find this a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This wears well alone, or mixed with a parfum with rose notes, i.e. Chloe.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, long lasting.</li>
            <li>A good alternative when you cannot afford the horribly expensive rose &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lovely rose smell and very long lasting!</li>
            <li>It is very strong so a little bit goes a long way, but the good news is this oil lasts for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>Rose varieties all smell a little different and you can create your own special rose scent with a little touch of something else.</li>
            <li>very potent, rose scent, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more from this company.</li>
            <li>I love several of these scents.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer egyptian goddess, love and aphrodesia.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on strong but the dry down is very, very nice, almost \\&quot;tea\\&quot; like, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>A little stronger smelling than i would have liked.</li>
            <li>Nice little size bottle.</li>
            <li>My mom absolutely LOVES this product.</li>
            <li>I put too much on my wrists and ended up having to rinse it off just because the smell was overpowering and giving me a headache.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated.</li>
            <li>This one just sort of makes its presence very known.</li>
            <li>The absolute cliche &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Reminds you of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>One tiny dab on the pulse point at the back of the knee is probably all you want and you&#x27;ll be trailing rose scent all day.  </li>
            <li>Nice with the tiniest touch of musk, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, something green, something fruity, oriental scents, etc.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over other rose perfumes, because they normally smell powdery or old womanish.</li>
            <li>A little strong at first, but really evens out well.</li>
            <li>It was a little overwhelming for me and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a classic rose scent I would definitely go with this one, as it doesn&#x27;t take much and will surely last a long time!</li>
            <li>Another favorite scent of mine mixes well with sandle wood oil again long lasting compliments all day &amp; night from men &amp; women</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s VERY potent which I wasn&#x27;t really expecting, and just a little overpowering and not very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Very nice but unfortunately</li>
            <li>(I wanted to try on a new bathing suit and didn&#x27;t want to get anything on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drives &#x27;em wild every time!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>No matter how little u put on it still smells way to strong.</li>
            <li>very strong but nice recommend mixing it with a base oil and using just a tad</li>
            <li>NO smell really nice like an expensive perfum ;)</li>
            <li>It is too strong smelling for me, I add a few drops of this to my baby oil.</li>
            <li>, I just open the cap, bring my wrist down onto the the top and \\&quot;tap\\</li>
            <li>and EVERYBODY said it smelled like old lady.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong fragrance so very little is needed</li>
            <li>I had to wash with soap just to bring it down to mild</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and what I expected.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, be aware of that, because it can overwhelm people around you and you won&#x27;t be aware of it.</li>
            <li>Perfectly long lasting rose scent and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I volunteer with the public frequently</li>
            <li>The first day I put it on I dabbed some on both wrists and a little on my neck.</li>

            <li> There is nothing particularly exotic or alluring about it, but if you are looking for a nice quality, budget friendly, long lasting, very distinctively ROSE perfume oil</li>
            <li> Normally I love Rose but find this a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This wears well alone, or mixed with a parfum with rose notes, i.e. Chloe.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, long lasting.</li>
            <li> A good alternative when you cannot afford the horribly expensive rose &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lovely rose smell and very long lasting!</li>
            <li> It is very strong so a little bit goes a long way, but the good news is this oil lasts for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li> Rose varieties all smell a little different and you can create your own special rose scent with a little touch of something else.</li>
            <li> very potent, rose scent, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more from this company.</li>
            <li> I love several of these scents.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer egyptian goddess, love and aphrodesia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on strong but the dry down is very, very nice, almost \\&quot;tea\\&quot; like, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> A little stronger smelling than i would have liked.</li>
            <li> Nice little size bottle.</li>
            <li> My mom absolutely LOVES this product.</li>
            <li> I put too much on my wrists and ended up having to rinse it off just because the smell was overpowering and giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated.</li>
            <li> This one just sort of makes its presence very known.</li>
            <li> The absolute cliche &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Reminds you of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> One tiny dab on the pulse point at the back of the knee is probably all you want and you&#x27;ll be trailing rose scent all day.  </li>
            <li> Nice with the tiniest touch of musk, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, something green, something fruity, oriental scents, etc.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over other rose perfumes, because they normally smell powdery or old womanish.</li>
            <li> A little strong at first, but really evens out well.</li>
            <li> It was a little overwhelming for me and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a classic rose scent I would definitely go with this one, as it doesn&#x27;t take much and will surely last a long time!</li>
            <li> Another favorite scent of mine mixes well with sandle wood oil again long lasting compliments all day &amp; night from men &amp; women</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s VERY potent which I wasn&#x27;t really expecting, and just a little overpowering and not very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Very nice but unfortunately</li>
            <li> (I wanted to try on a new bathing suit and didn&#x27;t want to get anything on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drives &#x27;em wild every time!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> No matter how little u put on it still smells way to strong.</li>
            <li> very strong but nice recommend mixing it with a base oil and using just a tad</li>
            <li> NO smell really nice like an expensive perfum ;)</li>
            <li> It is too strong smelling for me, I add a few drops of this to my baby oil.</li>
            <li> , I just open the cap, bring my wrist down onto the the top and \\&quot;tap\\</li>
            <li> and EVERYBODY said it smelled like old lady.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong fragrance so very little is needed</li>
            <li> I had to wash with soap just to bring it down to mild</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, be aware of that, because it can overwhelm people around you and you won&#x27;t be aware of it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly long lasting rose scent and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I volunteer with the public frequently</li>
            <li> The first day I put it on I dabbed some on both wrists and a little on my neck.</li>
            <li> so I will naturally purchase other oils/incense from this seller again.</li>
            <li> If anything, this stuff will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> toilet like another brand i tried but</li>
            <li> I had read this on the other reviews, so when I applied it, I only rolled it on once, about an inch long - then spread and rubbed all over me.</li>
            <li> I grow Oklahoma red roses that are extremely fragrant.</li>
            <li> Seems silly, but that is strong enough to overwhelm for a few minutes before mellowing out.</li>
            <li> I hate perfumes with musk undertones, I wanted something clean and pure.</li>
            <li> It was just not worth mailing back.</li>
            <li> I have FINALLY found a scent that I AND other folks can smell !  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way &amp; last all day.</li>
            <li> maybe the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight enough when it was packed.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> Not really a feminine smell i was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrance, that also stands out in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will have to try the other Auric oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other people are getting a different bottle than I did, but I wish I had listened to the scattered reviews telling buyers to beware.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong that it smells bad and gives me a headache</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to scents, I usually wish that some fragrances would be stronger.</li>
            <li> i just took it out of my purse a few minutes ago to see if it would calm my nerves from a crazy morning.  </li>
            <li> The envelope and bottle were both coated with oil - it was a mess.</li>
            <li> And when I received it, the cap had not been put on tightly before shipping</li>
            <li> Just stick to a little on your pulse points.</li>
            <li> disgusting wierd, chemical smelling rose, threw in the trash...</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> If you buy this just try a small fab on each wrist.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong with that one.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong when I could smell roses before I even opened the box</li>
            <li> was skeptical that it will smell like those home chemical spray that you use for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this scent.</li>
            <li> It stinks to me.</li>
            <li> It smelled just as bad on as it did from the bottle</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Theres no way you can be in a bad mood when you catch wiffs of roses all day!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> To me it was a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The scent is classic, clean, and strong. I will be purchasing from this supplier in the future.</li>
            <li> A lovely, crisp rose perfume. The oil evaporates quickly, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a strong fragrance so very little is needed and I smell like a freaking garden.</li>
            <li> My mom absolutely LOVES this product. I buy it every year for her as one of her X-Mas gifts! Thank you!</li>
            <li> was not any kind of aroma i would ever wear..  sorry</li>
            <li> Another favorite scent of mine mixes well with sandle wood oil again long lasting compliments all day &amp; night from men &amp; women</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Smells wonderful.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fabulous fragrance at a more than acceptable price.</li>
            <li> If anything, this stuff will last me a long time! While it does have a nice rose scent (anyone will know that it&#x27;s a classic rose), it is very potent! The first day I put it on I dabbed some on both wrists and a little on my neck. I put too much on my wrists and ended up having to rinse it off just because the smell was overpowering and giving me a headache. I&#x27;m not sensitive to scents, I usually wish that some fragrances would be stronger. However, this one was surprisingly strong! Very concentrated. But also a nice rose scent. So if you&#x27;re looking for a classic rose scent I would definitely go with this one, as it doesn&#x27;t take much and will surely last a long time! It&#x27;s not Bulgarian Rose, which is a bit softer and sweeter. This one just sort of makes its presence very known.</li>
            <li> I love this amber scent and have used it for years. When I saw this low price, I couldn&#x27;t believe. The product was exactly as described and what I expected. I will definitely be ordering more from this company. thank you</li>
            <li> OMG !  I have FINALLY found a scent that I AND other folks can smell !  I will re-order !  My search for fragrance has ended !</li>
            <li> Very Strong scent of Roses</li>
            <li> I love several of these scents. Egyptian Goddess is the best.. Wish they were a bit stronger but I love that they don&#x27;t change on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a rose perfume oil. It is too strong smelling for me, I add a few drops of this to my baby oil. I will have to try the other Auric oils. My order come before the estimated date so I will naturally purchase other oils/incense from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This amber has a fantastic scent that is exactly right in strength!  It smells deliciously warm and enticing! One of the better ambers out there!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this scent.  I wore it to work and EVERYBODY said it smelled like old lady.  :(&lt;br /&gt;I liked it though!  It is very strong so just one dab on your desired pulse points and your good.</li>
            <li> Very authentic and intense rose scent that lasts all day long. If you love rose scent this is an oil you should try. Very feminine-Not overwhelming though. My husband loves this fragrance on me.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this oil, but when I wear it, it is very overpowering. The rose smell is great, but very strong, so I advise only wearing a dab if you are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I wanted the smell of a rose garden and I finally got it! I hate perfumes with musk undertones, I wanted something clean and pure. This literally smells like a rose!</li>
            <li> very strong but nice recommend mixing it with a base oil and using just a tad</li>
            <li> The rose scent is overbearing. No matter how little u put on it still smells way to strong. Their Love scent is my fave,  u can&#x27;t go wrong with that one.</li>
            <li> The absolute cliche &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; 😞 I LOVE the scent of rose, and based on these reviews I thought I had found a winner. It smelled just as bad on as it did from the bottle (good thing I was going to take a shower right after). I&#x27;m not sure if other people are getting a different bottle than I did, but I wish I had listened to the scattered reviews telling buyers to beware. Oh well you win some you loose some. YOUVE BEEN WARNED!</li>
            <li> Smell is awesome but kind of smells like baby powder not rose</li>
            <li> This roll on perfume oil smells devine! Ive been intersted in finding a rose oil perfume and this is exactly what I wanted! Its very strong. You only need a little dab.It literally smells like the most beautiful boquet of roses. Im very happy with this product! And you certinly cant beat the price.It definatly also brightens my mood when I wear it. Theres no way you can be in a bad mood when you catch wiffs of roses all day!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a rose scented perfume, look elsewhere!! This did not smell like roses, it smelt strongly of soap!</li>
            <li> Very nice but unfortunately the bottle leaked during transit. Not sure what happened maybe the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight enough when it was packed. I knew something was wrong when I could smell roses before I even opened the box haha.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this scent. I personally prefer egyptian goddess, love and aphrodesia. To me, its a bit overbearing.</li>
            <li> was skeptical that it will smell like those home chemical spray that you use for you toilet like another brand i tried but NO smell really nice like an expensive perfum ;)&lt;br /&gt;Trust me go for it, it  smells very nice !</li>
            <li> This is the perfect rise afrodisiac oil! Drives &#x27;em wild every time! Perfectly long lasting rose scent and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil!  I get so many compliments on the purity and beauty of the fragrance.  I have one at home and one in my purse.</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong, and over-bearing. It&#x27;s so strong that it smells bad and gives me a headache and the scent doesn&#x27;t leave my nostrils even after washing it away. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice to me. It stinks to me. Better for older women. I like more musky \\&quot;spicy\\&quot;, oriental or sweet smells. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Very nice rose scent. A little goes a long way, be aware of that, because it can overwhelm people around you and you won&#x27;t be aware of it. Just stick to a little on your pulse points.</li>
            <li> Normally I love Rose but find this a little overpowering.  A little goes a long way &amp; last all day.</li>
            <li> Lovely rose smell and very long lasting!</li>
            <li> wonderful scent and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I LOVE this rose oil! I&#x27;ve been using it whenever Ivan find it for years. I love walking into a room and have people wondering who brought the flowers! I get more compliments on this scent than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Even bees come over thinking I&#x27;m a flower! Buy it love it! Enjoy the attention!!!</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful scent - like a real rose, not rose-scented incense. A word of warning, it&#x27;s VERY VERY strong! I had read this on the other reviews, so when I applied it, I only rolled it on once, about an inch long - then spread and rubbed all over me. Wow! I had to wash with soap just to bring it down to mild (it didn&#x27;t remove it). I had to take a shower to remove it (I wanted to try on a new bathing suit and didn&#x27;t want to get anything on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just open the cap, bring my wrist down onto the the top and \\&quot;tap\\&quot; it. I don&#x27;t turn the bottle over or roll it or anything. Seems silly, but that is strong enough to overwhelm for a few minutes before mellowing out. This will last decades!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of roses, and I LOVE the smell of this rose perfume oil.  It is very strong so a little bit goes a long way, but the good news is this oil lasts for hours and hours.  It&#x27;s goes on strong but the dry down is very, very nice, almost \\&quot;tea\\&quot; like, if that makes any sense.  This is definitely the best rose fragrance I have ever come across.  The price was awesome, shipping was super fast, and I will definitely order again and again!!!</li>
            <li> This was bought by my sister on my account (she doesn&#x27;t have one of her own). One of the girls at the renn faire was wearing this and EVERYONE loved it. So my sister had to go get some of her own.  Great floral scent, but not chemical in smell. Reminds you of the real thing.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. VERY PLEASED. LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li> this rose oil smells fabulour!  i just took it out of my purse a few minutes ago to see if it would calm my nerves from a crazy morning.  it did!</li>
            <li> This is the same rose scent that you probably smelled in your grandmother&#x27;s powder or rose scented soap.  There is nothing particularly exotic or alluring about it, but if you are looking for a nice quality, budget friendly, long lasting, very distinctively ROSE perfume oil this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, it&#x27;s potent and gets even stronger once your skin has had a chance to warm it so go easy.  One tiny dab on the pulse point at the back of the knee is probably all you want and you&#x27;ll be trailing rose scent all day.  Anything closer to your face might be headache inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something more exotic, layer this on with another scent and try your hand at the art of perfumery. Nice with the tiniest touch of musk, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, something green, something fruity, oriental scents, etc. Rose varieties all smell a little different and you can create your own special rose scent with a little touch of something else.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent! I have received many compliment when wearing it. It smells as good as Bulgarian oil. Thanks.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get exactly what you&#x27;re asking for... and you will smell just like a rose! Just so happens, I love the smell of rose! This is a soft fragrance, that also stands out in a subtle way. This wears well alone, or mixed with a parfum with rose notes, i.e. Chloe.  I also bought this as a gift for my other rose loving friend, and she also agreed... smells just like roses! Beautiful!</li>
            <li> A little stronger smelling than i would have liked. Not really a feminine smell i was looking for. Shipping was quick. If you buy this just try a small fab on each wrist.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that smells like a rose .  This is pachouli and smells nothing at all like a rose. To me it was a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I received this hoping for a nice rosey smell based on the reviews. It smells like rose and burnt rubber. And when I received it, the cap had not been put on tightly before shipping so when I opened it, it had been leaking all over the inside of the plastic mailing envelope they used for shipping. The envelope and bottle were both coated with oil - it was a mess. Ended up throwing it away. Very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful rose smell, it couldn&#x27;t smell closer to the real thing. A little strong at first, but really evens out well. I love catching whiffs of myself all day wearing this stuff. I am a rose lover. I grow Oklahoma red roses that are extremely fragrant. I could spend all day outside smelling the roses. But with this stuff, I don&#x27;t have to. I have gotten a lot of compliments wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this brand, Auric Blends, by a friend who came to work smelling so nice. She bought me a bottle of the Love scent and I have thoroughly enjoyed that one as well.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this scent I get a million compliments!&lt;br /&gt;I need to order like a dozen.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t seem to keep it stocked!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick shipping, but it smells cheap. It was a little overwhelming for me and gave me a headache. I actually ended up throwing it away after one use.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, a really strong, vibrant rose scent that lasts the whole day. I prefer this over other rose perfumes, because they normally smell powdery or old womanish.</li>
            <li> disgusting wierd, chemical smelling rose, threw in the trash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;crabtree and evelyn rose is the best rose Ive found so far..sigh..looks like I will have to bite the bullet and spend $80</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I use.  Like its scent.  Nice, clean rose.  A good alternative when you cannot afford the horribly expensive rose &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly love this product</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t love the smell of this oil, but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. it&#x27;s VERY potent which I wasn&#x27;t really expecting, and just a little overpowering and not very pleasing. good price for the size of the roller ball though.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, smells wonderful. A little goes a long way. Nice little size bottle.</li>
            <li> I volunteer with the public frequently and I can wear this fragrance without bothering individuals who are \\&quot;scent-sitive\\&quot;.  I brush some in my hair in the morning and I smell of roses all day.  My husband tells me it reminds him of the day we were married where there were huge wild rose bushes all around us!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a padded envelope and I opened it to find it had leaked!  Part of the label was worn off and the oil was all over the place.  Awful.  It was just not worth mailing back.</li>
            <li> very potent, rose scent, a little goes a long way.  wonderful little roll on bottle</li>
    </ol>
