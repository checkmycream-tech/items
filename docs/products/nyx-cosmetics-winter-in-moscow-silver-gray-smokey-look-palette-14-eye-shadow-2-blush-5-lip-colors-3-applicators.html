            <li>The pigments are strong and don&#x27;t fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic palette.</li>
            <li>It is great for the Different Shades of Gray.</li>
            <li>I especially love layering the soft peachy blush,the paler matte under the apples of my cheeks over a pink cheek stain.  </li>
            <li>I just quickly put some on and got results.</li>
            <li>Blushes and lip colors are on the warmer side of neutral, but very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this palette, which I bought for $20 at my local Ulta store to take with me on a trip.  </li>
            <li>Omg very pretty....</li>
            <li>Beautiful smoky tones with gray, green, taupe, and pewter undertones.</li>
            <li>There is every color of grey one could imagine and perfect to blend into different &#x27;looks&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit but only for winter!  </li>
            <li>Not as thrilling as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li>After reading all the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews I was really excited to get it, and I have many other products from NYX that I love, so I didn&#x27;t think this one would be different.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good palette to experiment with different looks and have fun with.</li>
            <li>and I love the variety of greys, plus a couple grey greens.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected, certainly.</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I expected but still a good size.</li>
            <li>Not high quality but its great for a little flair from time to time.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this palette.  </li>
            <li>The colour eye shadows are so nice together or mixed with other shadows.</li>
            <li>This palette is my new fave.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and their products do not break me out.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow (which is the reason I bought it) shades range from very light white to very dark, with some being matte and some being shimmery.  </li>
            <li>The lip colors - are average at best and do not last long at all, very sheer with little color depth.</li>
            <li>I add little pops of color from other palettes to make this even more versatile.</li>
            <li>The shadows aren&#x27;t bad; I do like the variety, and it&#x27;s easy to apply some of them as a powder liner with the right tool.  </li>

            <li> but the Product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a peachy eyeshadow shade for highlighting, but am content to use the slightly darker shimmery peach blush instead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually now addicted to the peach blush - even if I didn&#x27;t like the grays and silver, I&#x27;d probably buy the palette again just for the blush.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> By that I mean they weren&#x27;t pigmented</li>
            <li> the make up tools they give you are Poor.</li>
            <li> I think others have said the accompanying brushes are totally useless, and with that I agree.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed by ANYTHING NYX makes.  </li>

            <li> Colors are nice, but not intensive pigment.</li>
            <li> Not as thrilling as I&#x27;d hoped.  The gloss colours are non-existent and the blush colours are too-existent.  The shadows aren&#x27;t bad; I do like the variety, and it&#x27;s easy to apply some of them as a powder liner with the right tool.  I think others have said the accompanying brushes are totally useless, and with that I agree.  It is what it is; use what you like from it - don&#x27;t use what you don&#x27;t like.  I give it a 2.5.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette! The colors are beautiful and you can create a nice smoky eye with this. Face colors would work on all skin tones.</li>
            <li> This set has it all! Every color of each product is beautiful. There is every color of grey one could imagine and perfect to blend into different &#x27;looks&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Photos don&#x27;t do this palette justice. Beautiful smoky tones with gray, green, taupe, and pewter undertones. Something for everyone. Blushes and lip colors are on the warmer side of neutral, but very pretty. This palette is my new fave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic palette. The variety of the grays is excellent, and the blushes and lip glosses it comes with are great too.

Also, the brushes that come with it are pretty good. Better than I expected, certainly.</li>
            <li> I love almost anything NYX makes.  I was turned onto it by watching JERSEYLICIOUS. Olivia recommended the NYX brand. I have not been disappointed by ANYTHING NYX makes.  I have VERY sensitive skin and their products do not break me out. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit but only for winter!  Case is nice and price was good.  Colors look nice with winter clothes.</li>
            <li> Entire makeup collection.  I use it everyday. The colour eye shadows are so nice together or mixed with other shadows. The blushes are my all time favorite. Very nice lips glosses/lipsticks. The price you cant beat it!. It arrived on time perfectly. I am ordering another. I cant be without this product. :)</li>
            <li> Not high quality but its great for a little flair from time to time. I bought it for a friend it looks great on her!</li>

            <li> Love this palette! I bought it for my mother for Christmas, because she likes smoky colors for her eyes. It came in perfect condition, the makeup wasn&#x27;t disturbed at all. It is a really nice size to be able to carry around or have in your bathroom. I love how easily you can open and shut the palette, and the size of the mirror is perfect!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. It was smaller than I expected but still a good size. Nice quality.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette!  The eyeshadow (which is the reason I bought it) shades range from very light white to very dark, with some being matte and some being shimmery.  Also, some of the grey tones have a greenish or blueish undertone, and some have beige undertones, so you can always find a shade to complement your outfit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on. Even though I put an eye shadow primer. Only use it once</li>
            <li> I love the blushes and they are very good for a variety of skin tones. The lip colors - are average at best and do not last long at all, very sheer with little color depth. The shadows are very nice and I love the variety of greys, plus a couple grey greens.</li>
            <li> It came fast. Very pigmented. I just quickly put some on and got results. Awesome.  I wanted to attach a pic of my eye wearing it but no place to do that. Too bad</li>
            <li> all though I got my package the Day Before it was projected to be here. (what was great!) but the Product was not what I expected. it is smaller by a 3rd. It is great for the Different Shades of Gray. the Quality and Quantity are Great. the make up tools they give you are Poor.</li>
            <li> Great palette without a lot of drop off when applying. The pigments are strong and don&#x27;t fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Omg very pretty....fast shipping will get another one perfect for smokey eyes colors go on well and blend perfect cant wait to try all the colors</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this palette.  After reading all the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews I was really excited to get it, and I have many other products from NYX that I love, so I didn&#x27;t think this one would be different. The blushes &amp; lip colors were good, but some of the eyeshadows were lacking. By that I mean they weren&#x27;t pigmented I had to go over the color numerous times in order to get any color. Not all the colors are like this, just some. Needless to say I was disappointed because I have NYX&#x27;s single eyeshadows and have always been very happy with them. Overall, it&#x27;s a good palette to experiment with different looks and have fun with. Also,  you are getting a lot of product for a good price. The seller was great, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The colors are great to do the smokey eye look. Compact with a good mirror, great for travel or carry in your purse for every day touch ups.</li>
