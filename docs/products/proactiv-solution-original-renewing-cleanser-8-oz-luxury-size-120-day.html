            <li>This has always been an effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I love Proactive and have been using it for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I saved a lot on packaging by buying this luxury size, but wish it had a flip top cap.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy from here because it&#x27;s such a great deal!</li>
            <li>and I get a better deal on them.</li>
            <li>but it is ok.  </li>
            <li>However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not to sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I love Proactive</li>
            <li>I love this huge size of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>strong RX&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I prefer the 8 ounce luxury size, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
            <li>For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price...!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that sometimes the expiration date is close to when you buy it</li>
            <li>I love the size and appreciated the value.  </li>
            <li>Product improved 50% of skin condition quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for several years now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>exactly!</li>
            <li>I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when my doctor advised me I would not be able to take my acne medication during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing; it leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I received it right away</li>
            <li>Its definitely better than anything I have ever used from the drug store and despite the high price, I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice for someone who wants to buy Proactive products individually without getting locked in a contract.</li>
            <li>or I just got a more recent batch.  </li>
            <li>I detest their billing practices and never know when I will be charged and what exactly I am being charged for so</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>i use the cleanser much more that the lotion or toner and this luxury size seems to last me forever!</li>
            <li>It is not that helpful for serious acne you need a good dermo who will have a treatment plan and not just mild RX&#x27;s like epiduo or retin a.need antibiotics and</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore for a very long time.</li>
            <li>This has a screw top which can be a hassle in the shower when hands are wet.</li>
            <li>Did not improve much aster</li>
            <li>that but is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the toner, but I do use the cleanser and the repairing lotion.</li>
            <li>Instead went to see a real dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought proactiv products from amazon many times and have been happy with them but the last few times I&#x27;m not sure that they where really proactiv the texture and smell seemed to be off from the real thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who has mild to moderate acne and Proactive has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that has consistently worked at keeping my acne away.</li>
            <li>So much easier to purchase this product through Amazon than through the actual company.  </li>
            <li>A little more $ up front goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old that struggles with adult acne and this is the only product I have found that will give me the clear skin I deserve.  </li>
            <li>I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin.</li>
            <li>The subscription service by Proactiv only offers a much smaller size.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend with all the proactive products, would order again with all other products</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for several years now, and I love it! I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when my doctor advised me I would not be able to take my acne medication during a pregnancy. The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in 2 weeks. For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for! Over the years, due to the high cost of Proactiv, I&#x27;ve tried using other products on different occasions, such as the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), always with disastrous effect. You know the saying you get what you pay for...exactly! So, now I&#x27;m back with my Proactiv. Its expensive, but well worth it. This cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing; it leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and smooth. I find that the repairing treatment (which is the face cream) lasts me three times as long as the cleanser and toner, so invariably I will purchase an extra bottle of cleanser and toner in between buying the kit. I prefer the 8 ounce luxury size, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
            <li> I love Proactive and have been using it for 10 years.  I saved a lot on packaging by buying this luxury size, but wish it had a flip top cap.  This has a screw top which can be a hassle in the shower when hands are wet.</li>
            <li> An awesome value. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 4 months and still have plenty left. A little more $ up front goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great price.  I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for over 20 years and this works!  It&#x27;s true that sometimes the expiration date is close to when you buy it but the product lasts well beyond that date.  My last purchase had an expiration date one year after the purchase date so maybe that&#x27;s changed or I just got a more recent batch.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what the date says for me.  I will continue to buy from here because it&#x27;s such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! And it&#x27;s a great price-- this is the giant size. I use it on my chest and my face, so I gothrough it faster. This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old that struggles with adult acne and this is the only product I have found that will give me the clear skin I deserve.  This product even blows prescriptions my dermatologist prescribed to me out of the water.  I also have sensitive skin where other products burned or caused excessive dry skin, proactiv is gentle. I would recommend this product to anyone that is tired of living with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who has mild to moderate acne and Proactive has worked for me.  The directions say to use it twice a day, but I only use it once at night when I take a shower.  If you use it everyday along with the toner and lotion it should work for you.  It took about 2 months of everyday use before I started noticing results.  It also doesn&#x27;t completely prevent new acne, I just get it much less often and much less severe.  Its definitely better than anything I have ever used from the drug store and despite the high price, I would highly recommend it.  I also prefer buying the larger size containers of all three products.  They last longer and I get a better deal on them.</li>
            <li> This is not an 8 Oz bottle.  I received 2 4Oz bottles instead.  While this is not necessarily a problem, it&#x27;s described incorrectly as being a one 8 Oz bottle in the description.</li>
            <li> It is not that helpful for serious acne you need a good dermo who will have a treatment plan and not just mild RX&#x27;s like epiduo or retin a.need antibiotics and strong RX&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Whenever I order the monthly shipments from ProActiv, I always run out of the wash and have tons of the step 3 cream left over.  This is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Product improved 50% of skin condition quickly. Did not improve much aster that but is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Works great. Best thing I&#x27;ve found to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery, rate a 5 Great product! Would highly recommend with all the proactive products, would order again with all other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my problem/sensitive skin. It&#x27;s the only thing that has consistently worked at keeping my acne away. The few times that I stopped using it and tried different cleansers, my acne came back within a week:(</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It works very well for me.  I don&#x27;t really use the toner, but I do use the cleanser and the repairing lotion.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting 2 of this to make up for the amount that 1 big bottle would give me but it is ok.  It&#x27;s really nice for someone who wants to buy Proactive products individually without getting locked in a contract.</li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin. However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product. It has been very effective and gentler on her skin. It&#x27;s pricey, but buying it through Amazon has helped.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Instead went to see a real dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever! And it&#x27;s cheaper here than through proactiv or at one of their kiosks.  Mine lasts just shy of 90 days and I wash my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> I love the size and appreciated the value.  The mailing process was fast as I was out and needed it badly.</li>
            <li> Great product for those suffering from acne!  I recommend this product &amp; SELLER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought proactiv products from amazon many times and have been happy with them but the last few times I&#x27;m not sure that they where really proactiv the texture and smell seemed to be off from the real thing and I&#x27;m not to sure it&#x27;s working I seem to be breaking out a lot!! So be cautious, I think I&#x27;ll go back to buying it from proactiv themselves!!</li>
            <li> This has always been an effective cleanser. I like the larger size for its convenience. The subscription service by Proactiv only offers a much smaller size.</li>
            <li> So much easier to purchase this product through Amazon than through the actual company.  I detest their billing practices and never know when I will be charged and what exactly I am being charged for so, one shot and I got exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this huge size of the cleanser. i use the cleanser much more that the lotion or toner and this luxury size seems to last me forever!</li>
            <li> I love Proactive and I try to never be without the renewing cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using ProActiv for years and did not know there was an 8 oz. bottle so I had to order it.  I received it right away and it is 8 ozs.! It&#x27;s worth the price...!  I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore for a very long time.</li>
