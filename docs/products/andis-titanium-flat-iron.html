    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so the 1 inch flatiron is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and I can say it makes her hair look great.</li>
            <li>It works great and does the job.</li>
            <li>Not the best iron but very good for a store bought hot iron.</li>
            <li>It works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I currently own a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This works nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a nice product, designed well with nice features</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Titanium is very smooth and goes through the hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;(2) dual voltage which is perfect for international travel&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with a locking option.</li>
            <li>works, but I still like my ceramic one better for some reason.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>It made a wonderful present.</li>
            <li>Maybe my  hair just works better with ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>This straightener does an okay job.  </li>
            <li>My favorite straightener for all hair types is the Chi.  </li>
            <li>*  Temperature control dial - there are 20 heat settings (I love this feature as you can adjust the heat depending on what your hair is doing that</li>
            <li>It has auto shut off which is my favorite feature as I have to teenagers who tend to forget to unplug or turn it</li>
            <li>Love this straightner.</li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase :)</li>
            <li>The Andis Titanium Flat Iron is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Andis Titanium Flat Iron glides so smoothly over my hair and straightens it perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is a good home flat iron, good for teens.</li>
            <li>It will heat up to 450 degrees which is good for really unruly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great thing about this iron is that it is very light, and smaller</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The on and off button are easily reached and not placed on the inside of the iron.</li>
            <li>Works well on my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Glides smoothly and easily&lt;</li>
            <li>That said, the Andis Titanium 450 Flat Iron is a modern-day answer to an age-old dilemma, a good starter item, described as safe to use without burning or damaging the hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron my niece loves it.</li>
            <li>absolutely love the titanium plates, makes for smooth, shiny, straight hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her&#x27;s heats up more than the Andis one and accomplishes the desired look faster, but it also cost three times as much.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the Andis is a good straightener for the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The grips at the top of the prongs were nice, but having similar grips on the body would have been more useful, as I didn&#x27;t have the ability to grip a section of hair, and the body AND the top, seeing as I only have 2 hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The titanium plates were smooth and my hair slid right through.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>She liked it, and it worked okay for a little while.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to have the temperature at the highest degree to get my hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It has a ready light</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something for less money the Andis is good.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on my hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>Because of this, an automatic shut-off feature is even more critical.</li>
            <li>However, within 90 days of using it, it quit getting hot.  </li>
            <li>Essentially, it is not usable any more</li>
            <li>If you can afford the Chi or Croc, I would spend the extra money and get those as they are both much better.  </li>
            <li>and I was glad that I could adjust the heat on the flat iron so that it didn&#x27;t get too hot and burn my hair.</li>
            <li>It still gets warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than the Revlon flat iron; but, compared to the Chi and Croc</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good mid line flat iron.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is not heavy like some straighteners can be.  </li>
            <li>It glides easily through my coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter has very coarse, fine, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First what I like:&lt;br /&gt;(1) heats up fast and maintains the heat while you work it through your hair&lt;br</li>
            <li>iron heats up fast and maintains heat throughout.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t take very  well to the plates.  </li>
            <li>so you know when it ready</li>
            <li>I like this flat iron, it has some nice features that the flat iron I was using didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It easily straightens the shorter pieces near the back of my neck, where my hair is layered and stacked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give you a smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t over dry your hair or get it to staticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works as a straightener, but takes several passes, and doesn&#x27;t have any features that make it (to me) extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Decent buy for the price.</li>
            <li>There are little grippe places on the top that keep your fingers from burning.</li>
            <li>First, although it heats up fast, I had to go through each section several times for it style the hear.</li>
            <li>but when my daughter, who has super thick hair tried it, it worked perfectly fine for her.  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron for such a little price, just like a professional one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My g/f take on this item: Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new to hair straightening, but this product didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I like the Andis one inch flat irons because they help flatten out every kink in my hair without leaving it dry and brittle and I love</li>
            <li>A bit clumsy for smaller hands, it will take some practice to become adept at using this flat iron, to become familiar with its weight and ease of handling- or not.</li>
            <li>Second, it is not that hot.</li>
            <li>The iron is hot enough to straighten but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt hair.</li>
            <li>There is a red light and green light clearly on the outside.</li>
            <li>This is my first non-ceramic flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is very light weight and a little smaller.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t call it salon quality, but it is much nicer than the one I owned prior.</li>
            <li>and when I locked it while it was heating up, the green light never stopped blinking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I firmly believe you can&#x27;t have too many flat irons.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this flat iron, but doesn&#x27;t quite live up to what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extensions in my hair and the Titanium flat irons give them a silky look without drying them out or without drying my real hair out.</li>
            <li>A handy-sized flat iron with titanium plates with a very ergonomic design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a righty, so I hold the iron with my right hand to contract and release the plates, but I also need to squeeze the rubberized ends with my left hand and drag the iron all the way down in order for it give me a smooth result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Andis Titanium Flat Iron is my new go-to hair device.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not enough pressure in the clamp to get a really smooth effect which makes it awkward to use as you have to use your free hand to squeeze the rubberized</li>
            <li>It worked well enough on my daughter&#x27;s long fairly straight hair.  </li>
            <li>When doing the front part of my hair, I found that it the edges of the plates left crimps near my scalp.</li>
            <li>not sure what the purpose of the locking mechanism is, since you aren&#x27;t supposed to keep it clamped on your hair for more than a few seconds lest you do damage....</li>
            <li>Though it is not a top-of-the-line item in terms of expense, it provides the expected features, and a few more: titanium to preserve the integrity of the hair and seal the hair cuticle: 20 heat settings, up to 450 degrees; a clamp style to hold hair tightly; a swivel cord to avoid tangling; dual voltage; and an automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I will continue using my ceramic flat iron regularly.</li>
            <li> extra long swivel cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way</li>
            <li> titanium plates are flat, not curved, so there is a possibility that hair can get caught along the sides of the plates.</li>
            <li> I was looking to update my flat iron, or have a spare one for travel, but I won&#x27;t even try to use it for that.</li>
            <li> this is the flat iron that you need</li>
            <li> the Andis Titanium Flat Iron helps me control my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Andis Titanium Flat Iron does the job</li>
            <li> I have used the Revlon flat iron, Chi flat iron, and the Croc flat iron before getting the Andis Titanium flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Took me a second to figure out how to do it though since it was so different than my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is not a high grade salon flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product is serviceable, but like other such styling aids, an acquired skill, to avoid over-heating or burning the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an on off switch, a swivel cord a variable temperature setting and a twist lock to hold the flat iron closed when not in use.  </li>
            <li> and doesnt dry it out.</li>
            <li> My other flat iron&#x27;s plates are rounded around the edge which prevent those kinks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that the plates are shorter than my other ceramic flat</li>
            <li> My other flat iron had enough pressure when clamping down the plates that allowed me to do that with just one hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she&#x27;s using it right now.</li>
            <li> one, at setting 15 (out of 20) took 3 passes through every single small section of hair that I separated to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> While this flat iron is acceptable overall, I am not impressed with its quality or design features.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and not very hot</li>
            <li> We used it to add a little curl/wave to her hair, not to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> The cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way  and a neat little rubber pad at the end of the iron to press the sides  together without burning your fingertips.  </li>
            <li> It has no great flaws, but neither is it an item I will use daily.</li>
            <li> and I like the narrow plate on this straightener.  </li>
            <li> though it has heat settings they are VERY difficult to read, really I just have to guess.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to tell you since I never used it</li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron, but doesn&#x27;t quite live up to what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First what I like:&lt;br /&gt;(1) heats up fast and maintains the heat while you work it through your hair&lt;br /&gt;(2) dual voltage which is perfect for international travel&lt;br /&gt;(3) extra long swivel cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;(1) You need both hands to get optimal results. I&#x27;m a righty, so I hold the iron with my right hand to contract and release the plates, but I also need to squeeze the rubberized ends with my left hand and drag the iron all the way down in order for it give me a smooth result. My other flat iron had enough pressure when clamping down the plates that allowed me to do that with just one hand.&lt;br /&gt;(2) When doing the front part of my hair, I found that it the edges of the plates left crimps near my scalp. My other flat iron&#x27;s plates are rounded around the edge which prevent those kinks.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Back in the day\\&quot;, girls with curly hair had to resort to an ironing board and an iron to achieve what we take for granted to day. That said, the Andis Titanium 450 Flat Iron is a modern-day answer to an age-old dilemma, a good starter item, described as safe to use without burning or damaging the hair. Though it is not a top-of-the-line item in terms of expense, it provides the expected features, and a few more: titanium to preserve the integrity of the hair and seal the hair cuticle: 20 heat settings, up to 450 degrees; a clamp style to hold hair tightly; a swivel cord to avoid tangling; dual voltage; and an automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titanium plates are flat, not curved, so there is a possibility that hair can get caught along the sides of the plates. And while the heat dial can be raised or lowered, the numbers on the dial do not indicate the degrees of heat, nor is the dial lighted. Because of this, an automatic shut-off feature is even more critical. This product is serviceable, but like other such styling aids, an acquired skill, to avoid over-heating or burning the hair. (I would suggest a styling spray to protect the hair when using any heated styling aid.) A bit clumsy for smaller hands, it will take some practice to become adept at using this flat iron, to become familiar with its weight and ease of handling- or not. While this flat iron is acceptable overall, I am not impressed with its quality or design features. It has no great flaws, but neither is it an item I will use daily. Luan Gaines/2013.</li>
            <li> She loves it. Not sure what else to tell you since I never used it but she is 13 and I can say it makes her hair look great.</li>
            <li> I currently own a [[ASIN:B000ASDX3S BaByliss Pro BAB2590 Porcelain Ceramic Straightening Iron with Removable Comb, 1.5 Inch]] and seems I will be keeping the Babyliss. I was looking to update my flat iron, or have a spare one for travel, but I won&#x27;t even try to use it for that. As a point of reference, I have thin, slightly wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up fast and maintains heat throughout. But, tThere were several issues with this iron. First, although it heats up fast, I had to go through each section several times for it style the hear. I do not have curly hair, nor overly wavy hair yet, it takes double the work than my Babyliss. Second, it is not that hot. At least, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the 450 degrees it advertises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a smooth finish, doesn&#x27;t over dry your hair or get it to staticky.</li>
            <li> This works nicely. Heats up quickly. Very easy to use. It is lightweight and easy to handle. Love that it comes with a locking option. Took me a second to figure out how to do it though since it was so different than my previous flat iron. I can&#x27;t call it salon quality, but it is much nicer than the one I owned prior. Works well on my fine, wavy hair. I don&#x27;t know if it would be a match for someone with thicker or curly hair though.</li>
            <li> This is my first non-ceramic flat iron.  The Titanium is very smooth and goes through the hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this iron is that it is very light, and smaller so it&#x27;s easier to maneuver around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but I still like my ceramic one better for some reason.</li>
            <li> Andis Titanium Flat Iron glides so smoothly over my hair and straightens it perfectly. I have extensions in my hair and the Titanium flat irons give them a silky look without drying them out or without drying my real hair out. I like the Andis one inch flat irons because they help flatten out every kink in my hair without leaving it dry and brittle and I love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to straighten your hair without damaging or drying it out then this is the flat iron that you need the Andis Titanium Flat Iron helps me control my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My g/f take on this item: Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new to hair straightening, but this product didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I have a ceramic hair straightener, so I had something to compare it to:&lt;br /&gt;This one, at setting 15 (out of 20) took 3 passes through every single small section of hair that I separated to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the metal plate occasionally got caught in my hair and yanked strands out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of the locking mechanism is, since you aren&#x27;t supposed to keep it clamped on your hair for more than a few seconds lest you do damage....and when I locked it while it was heating up, the green light never stopped blinking.&lt;br /&gt;The grips at the top of the prongs were nice, but having similar grips on the body would have been more useful, as I didn&#x27;t have the ability to grip a section of hair, and the body AND the top, seeing as I only have 2 hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works as a straightener, but takes several passes, and doesn&#x27;t have any features that make it (to me) extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I have the 1\\&quot; iron and wish that I&#x27;d purchased the 1.5\\&quot; one.  It worked well enough on my daughter&#x27;s long fairly straight hair.  We used it to add a little curl/wave to her hair, not to straighten it.  My elder daughter took her iron to college so we purchased this so that we had an iron at home.  Her&#x27;s heats up more than the Andis one and accomplishes the desired look faster, but it also cost three times as much.  Bottom line, it will straighten and it will add waves/curls but it will take some skill (really slick ceramic plates) and some time to accomplish the task.  Decent buy for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I was glad that I could adjust the heat on the flat iron so that it didn&#x27;t get too hot and burn my hair. The dial is difficult to read the numbers and it is awkward. The titanium plates were smooth and my hair slid right through. I didn&#x27;t like that the plates are shorter than my other ceramic flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis Titanium Flat Iron does the job OK but I will continue using my ceramic flat iron regularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my youngest daughter for Christmas.  She liked it, and it worked okay for a little while.  However, within 90 days of using it, it quit getting hot.  It still gets warm, but not hot.  Essentially, it is not usable any more and we had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift at Christmas time for my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  She loves it and says she uses it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron my niece loves it. It made a wonderful present. It works great and does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron, it has some nice features that the flat iron I was using didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an on off switch, a swivel cord a variable temperature setting and a twist lock to hold the flat iron closed when not in use.  I like all of these features.  It also has two rubberized finger grips on the end for ease of use.  I like the smoothness of the metal and the way it glides over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a nice product, designed well with nice features and I like it.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe you can&#x27;t have too many flat irons. The Andis Titanium Flat Iron is wonderful. I don&#x27;t have to have the temperature at the highest degree to get my hair smooth and straight. Yay. No more smelling burnt hair. Yay. My hair glides along the plates without any hindrance. Some flatirons, if you start in the middle of your hair, will leave an indentation. The Andis doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chin-length hair so the 1 inch flatiron is perfect for me. It easily straightens the shorter pieces near the back of my neck, where my hair is layered and stacked. Because it&#x27;s only 1 inch I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andis Titanium Flat Iron is my new go-to hair device.</li>
            <li> A handy-sized flat iron with titanium plates with a very ergonomic design.  The cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way  and a neat little rubber pad at the end of the iron to press the sides  together without burning your fingertips.  My hair didn&#x27;t take very  well to the plates.  The ends looked frizzy  but when my daughter, who has super thick hair tried it, it worked perfectly fine for her.  Needless to say, she&#x27;s using it right now. Maybe my  hair just works better with ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I like the narrow plate on this straightener.  It heats quickly and is not heavy like some straighteners can be.  It glides easily through my coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;*Small enough for travel&lt;br /&gt;*Glides smoothly and easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Even though it has heat settings they are VERY difficult to read, really I just have to guess. The dial is in an awkward place and reading it is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> This is not a high grade salon flat iron. It is a good home flat iron, good for teens. There are little grippe places on the top that keep your fingers from burning. The iron is hot enough to straighten but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt hair. This is very light weight and a little smaller. There is a red light and green light clearly on the outside. The on and off button are easily reached and not placed on the inside of the iron. Not the best iron but very good for a store bought hot iron.</li>
            <li> I have used the Revlon flat iron, Chi flat iron, and the Croc flat iron before getting the Andis Titanium flat iron.  Overall, the Andis is a good straightener for the price.  It is much better than the Revlon flat iron; but, compared to the Chi and Croc, it does not even compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair.  I have two daughters.  One has hair similar to mine.  This straightener does an okay job.  My oldest daughter has very coarse, fine, frizzy hair.  It does not work for her at all.  She needs the Chi.  If you can afford the Chi or Croc, I would spend the extra money and get those as they are both much better.  My favorite straightener for all hair types is the Chi.  It works amazing.  But, they are closer to $100.  If you are looking for something for less money the Andis is good.  Here are the things I like and do not like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Temperature control dial - there are 20 heat settings (I love this feature as you can adjust the heat depending on what your hair is doing that day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It will heat up to 450 degrees which is good for really unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It has a ready light so you know when it ready and it only takes 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It has auto shut off which is my favorite feature as I have to teenagers who tend to forget to unplug or turn it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  There&#x27;s not enough pressure in the clamp to get a really smooth effect which makes it awkward to use as you have to use your free hand to squeeze the rubberized ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good mid line flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this straightner. It does a great job on my hard to straighten hair. and doesnt dry it out.Buy one</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron for such a little price, just like a professional one!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the titanium plates, makes for smooth, shiny, straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with this purchase :)</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and not very hot</li>
