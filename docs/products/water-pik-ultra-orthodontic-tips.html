            <li> Great tips, works with the waterpik for children... Needed for my son who has braces, and has been really helpful in his dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> They fit well as the original.  I bought 2 packs but I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this many.  I think the original that came with the machine may outlast the machine.  Only one kid uses the waterpik for her braces.</li>
            <li> Good, not as good as my plug in version of my water pik but great for the portability</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandchildren who have recently started wearing braces.  I remember so well how much help my water pik gave me when I wore braces.  My grandchildren are using the ortho brushes and say it is so nice to have them.</li>
            <li> I have had braces for more than four months, during which time I have I used the Water Pick, with an orthodontic tip, before I start brushing or flossing my teeth.

            <li> I&#x27;d have bought four of these rather than two.  This is great for getting at things that are stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought these along with the Water Pik Flosser for Kids after we learned that my oldest daughter needed braces. These hook up to the Water Pik Flosser seamlessly and do an excellent job getting in between the wires and bands. Well worth buying!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed. It fits waterpik unit and it works like a charm. Best price I could find it.</li>
            <li> Great replacement tips for your Water Pik</li>
            <li> Good price for the number of items sent. Since I live overseas it is nice to buy in numbers so I don&#x27;t have to do without as I wait for a new order.</li>

            <li> I got braces as an adult, and these orthodontic tips saved my life.  They remove food that not even brushing can remove.  I think these helped keep my gums healthy while I wore braces.</li>
            <li> I have deep pockets, and these pik sure help to keep them under control.&lt;br /&gt;I can not be without them.</li>
            <li> Good price. These really help with keeping braces clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an extra set for my WaterPik so that both of us in our household could use the product.</li>
            <li> Needed the extra pics with colors one for me one for spouse. Water pic is a great product highly recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased these to go with a Water Pik I&#x27;d purchased at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter was just at the beginning stages of getting braces where she had to wear an expander.&lt;br /&gt;It made a huge difference in keeping the appliance clean and I know it will help when she gets the actual braces put on.&lt;br /&gt;She loved the way it made her mouth feel clean without extra scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I bought these water piks to replace ones I had broken. They appear to be the genuine product and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has braces and a waterpik needs to buy these! I have used them for almost the whole 2 yrs I&#x27;ve worn braces and whenever I get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist always compliments me on how much better my teeth look compared to her other clients who are in braces!!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads for my water pik.  Glad I could get them.</li>
            <li> These work well.  My son wears braces.  This works well to clean in hard to reach places.  Good for the gums.  Recommended by our orthodontist.  Good price.</li>
            <li> just what I ordered; fit great on the water pik &amp; sonic toothbrush combo machine.  It is hard to find replacements</li>
