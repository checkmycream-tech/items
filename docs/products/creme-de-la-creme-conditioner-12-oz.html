            <li>it&#x27;s a shame to have to choose between the one that works best and a cheaper substandard option.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b hair and my hair responds best to cream-based products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did a great job of detangling</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I have no problems with it detangling my hair, and it makes my hair smell good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this!!!!</li>
            <li>working wonders after so many years!</li>
            <li>Let me start off my saying this smells amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had a nice experience with this conditioning cream.  </li>
            <li>So far MJ has the best of these products.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair with bangs</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products and the shipping was free!  </li>
            <li>Just ok</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair so healthly looking</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my son&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair once and month and this is the perfect product for that situation.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft clean and smells great!</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant enough (not like food) and it did a good job of detaangling and conditioning my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is also great because it leaves my curls soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Seems to coat the hair, keeping it strong.</li>
            <li>I love Miss Jessies Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo</li>
            <li>I enjoy the way my hair looks after a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I got a sample in a Birchbox shipment, and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great especially on humid days/nights.  </li>
            <li>Not laundry detergent, but clean laundry.</li>
            <li>Even with that being said my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, I had to rewash with something else.</li>
            <li>this hair cleanser is great for dry hair!</li>
            <li>Basically, I think it&#x27;s a good standard conditioner</li>
            <li>If you want a shampoo that lathers, try Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo.</li>
            <li>This item came quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>The Super Sudsy claims to be \\&quot;super sudsy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel nice, but it&#x27;s on par with most other conditioners in terms of what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d think your hair would look like golden spun spirals afterwards, but their products continue to disappoint me.</li>
            <li>my hair to be exactly NATURAL!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>It may not be for all shoppers, especially if they are more affected my scents.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like any particular perfume once your hair dries - just so, so clean.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with my fine textured curly hair for my entire life (</li>
            <li>I think it would be fantastic as a rinse out for white girls.  </li>
            <li>Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent, and keeps my very curly hair controlled, and really cuts way down on frizz.</li>
            <li>As soon as I went natural this was one of the first conditioners I tried.  </li>
            <li>and since I can think of many good standard conditioners that I use for far less money, there is no real need for me to purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>I noticed this product left my hair super moisturized.</li>
            <li>I co-wash often with only this product and it untangles my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is a little different than what I&#x27;m used to (i.e. shampoos that lather and strip everything out of my hair), but I do love it!</li>
            <li>Since my hair is dry and curly, I noticed that this product didn&#x27;t strip my hair of ALL the natural oils to leave it squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I put a very high premium on a conditioner&#x27;s ability to not only condition but to also detangle my curls.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, makes my curls manageable</li>
            <li>&amp; check out pillow soft curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Just touchably soft and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>As a person with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I suggest using the curly pudding right after it also adds moisture and gives my african american natural hair all the curls I could hope for.</li>
            <li>It is thin, which means I&#x27;ve got to use  a bit more product than normal.  </li>
            <li>this does not dry out hair and leaves you hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>I can never really tell much of a difference with new products anyway.</li>
            <li>They made my hair drier than it was before, bushy, tangled, and generally out of control.  </li>
            <li>but it barely lathers.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the money, and pretty much not worth it at all.</li>

            <li> After following up with the conditioner and towel drying my hair, I noticed that my curls actually held their shape and drastically less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think it would function well as a leave-in for my black hair, white girls, too, would benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> Be careful buying this.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not what it is marketed to be.  </li>
            <li> Second of all, it completely dried out my hair and made it WAY frizzier than it was to begin with.  </li>
            <li> She could leave some of it in if her hair is extremely curly.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why black hair care products are so costly....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t typically use a conditioner after.</li>
            <li> The smell will last days after you&#x27;ve washed and conditioned it but the product is so poor.  </li>
            <li> Not the worse smell in the world, but it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well enough to tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I thought I could tolerate the smell... doesn&#x27;t seem that bad... until it&#x27;s on your head all day!!  </li>
            <li> I had to reach for my usual conditioner to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the Super Sudsy and Creme Conditioner and they were all absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was really, really, really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> but I use it faithfully everyday and absolutly no build up at all!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency was too thin and didn&#x27;t feel like it was penetrating my hair.</li>
            <li> This is weird because it&#x27;s made for people with curly hair but is not a detangler.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is awful and hard to deal with in a warm/hot shower.  </li>
            <li> and my hair broke so badly</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my hair didn&#x27;t feel hydrated, my curls looked like crap</li>
            <li> I hate overly perfumed products, so when I got a sample of this I was basically over the moon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how nasty it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li> and I probably had one of the worst hair days</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only leave-in conditioner I have ever used that actually did anything. It leaves my hair soft, makes my curls manageable and I don&#x27;t need to add anything to it. My only issue is the price. It&#x27;s a bit steep for 12 oz. I don&#x27;t know why black hair care products are so costly....it&#x27;s a shame to have to choose between the one that works best and a cheaper substandard option.</li>
            <li> Let me start off my saying this smells amazing...but that&#x27;s it! The smell will last days after you&#x27;ve washed and conditioned it but the product is so poor.  It causes my hair to tangle when I use it because it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. It is also not soft and creamy as you might think.  I wanted to like it because of the smell but I used it for two weeks and my hair broke so badly I had to stop.  There are tons of shampoos without sulfate in them yet still moisturize/lather your hair.  This is weird because it&#x27;s made for people with curly hair but is not a detangler. Be careful buying this. Your hair will be knotted.</li>
            <li> I had a nice experience with this conditioning cream.  It smells pleasant enough (not like food) and it did a good job of detaangling and conditioning my curly hair.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t call this a cream.  It is thin, which means I&#x27;ve got to use  a bit more product than normal.  I didn&#x27;t think that it would get the job done, but it did.  I think it would function well as a leave-in for my black hair, white girls, too, would benefit from this product. She could leave some of it in if her hair is extremely curly. I think it would be fantastic as a rinse out for white girls.  Basically, I think it&#x27;s a good standard conditioner and since I can think of many good standard conditioners that I use for far less money, there is no real need for me to purchase this again.  If it were $5.oo, I&#x27;d stock up!</li>
            <li> this does not dry out hair and leaves you hair feeling very soft.  I enjoy the way my hair looks after a shampoo. I suggest using the curly pudding right after it also adds moisture and gives my african american natural hair all the curls I could hope for.</li>
            <li> As soon as I went natural this was one of the first conditioners I tried.  I&#x27;ve tried some others since, but I always come back to this one.  I have no problems with it detangling my hair, and it makes my hair smell good.  I also use it as a leave in to get my hair that extra moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. You should buy the shampoo. &amp; check out pillow soft curls.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from a local Target store. That night I cleansed my hair with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Crème De La Curl Cleansing Crème and followed up with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Crème De La Curl Conditioner. Since my hair is dry and curly, I noticed that this product didn&#x27;t strip my hair of ALL the natural oils to leave it squeaky clean. I noticed this product left my hair super moisturized. After following up with the conditioner and towel drying my hair, I noticed that my curls actually held their shape and drastically less frizzy. This product is a little different than what I&#x27;m used to (i.e. shampoos that lather and strip everything out of my hair), but I do love it! If you want a shampoo that lathers, try Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo. This product is also great because it leaves my curls soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I love Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products and the shipping was free!  I would purchase it again, you must try if you have un-manageable hair..</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b hair and my hair responds best to cream-based products. So far MJ has the best of these products. They&#x27;re pricey but last a long time. I co-wash often with only this product and it untangles my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok, I thought I could tolerate the smell... doesn&#x27;t seem that bad... until it&#x27;s on your head all day!!  Does smell like hospital soap.  Not the worse smell in the world, but it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well enough to tolerate it.  For my 3A/3B curls, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough slip.  Just ok</li>
            <li> I condition my hair a ton ever since using this product!&lt;br /&gt;Probably about 3x&#x27;s a week and it works wonders!!&lt;br /&gt;Allows my hair to be exactly NATURAL!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Miss Jessie.&lt;br /&gt;Still working wonders after so many years!</li>
            <li> I love Miss Jessies Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo so I thought I would try this conditioner. I can&#x27;t even describe how nasty it made my hair feel! I have naturally curly hair so I need lots of moisture. The shampoo did a great job of detangling but then I used this conditioner and my hair felt like sticky straw. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky, smooth and hydrated. I love the way it leaves my hair so healthly looking and it feels it, too.</li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme De La Creme Conditioning Cream is neither conditioning or creamy. I put a very high premium on a conditioner&#x27;s ability to not only condition but to also detangle my curls. I could not get any of my detangling combs or brushes through my hair with this product. I had to reach for my usual conditioner to finish the job. The consistency was too thin and didn&#x27;t feel like it was penetrating my hair. After rinsing, my hair didn&#x27;t feel hydrated, my curls looked like crap and I probably had one of the worst hair days EVER after using this conditioner. I don&#x27;t get it with the  Miss Jessie&#x27;s line, at the prices they charge you&#x27;d think your hair would look like golden spun spirals afterwards, but their products continue to disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Not laundry detergent, but clean laundry. This is a good thing. I hate overly perfumed products, so when I got a sample of this I was basically over the moon. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like any particular perfume once your hair dries - just so, so clean. It also makes my hair feel nice, but it&#x27;s on par with most other conditioners in terms of what it does for my hair. I can never really tell much of a difference with new products anyway.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I have been struggling with my fine textured curly hair for my entire life (35+ years!) and finally found a product that is moisturizing enough that does not build up or weigh it down.  This stuff truly rocks!!</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in a Birchbox shipment, and I liked it so much I looked it up on amazon.  This item came quickly and well packaged.  It has a stronger scent, but I like it.  It may not be for all shoppers, especially if they are more affected my scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the Super Sudsy and Creme Conditioner and they were all absolutely horrible.  They made my hair drier than it was before, bushy, tangled, and generally out of control.  The smell of this shampoo is awful and hard to deal with in a warm/hot shower.  It is not as creamy as you expect and neither is the conditioner.  The Super Sudsy claims to be \\&quot;super sudsy\\&quot; but it barely lathers.  Overall I was really, really, really disappointed.  Back to Dove for me for the time being.</li>
            <li> this hair cleanser is great for dry hair! it kinda threw me off because it doesn&#x27;t have the bubbles.I thought it was going to leave build up in my hair but I use it faithfully everyday and absolutly no build up at all!!! My hair is soft clean and smells great! BUY IT!!! LOL</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of sudless shampoo so perhaps that is the reason I didn&#x27;t like this product. Even with that being said my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, I had to rewash with something else. It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for my son&#x27;s curly hair. Very moisturizing and I don&#x27;t typically use a conditioner after. I follow with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding</li>
            <li> Love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. You can even use this as a leave in conditioner.  I have very fine hair with bangs and this never leaves my hair greasy looking.  Just touchably soft and tangle-free.  Love Love Love this!!!!</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once and month and this is the perfect product for that situation. It brings back all the curls that I havent seen in years. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I lose virtually no hair when coming after rinsing out this conditioner.  Seems to coat the hair, keeping it strong.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great especially on humid days/nights.  It has a lovely scent, and keeps my very curly hair controlled, and really cuts way down on frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not what it is marketed to be.  As a person with naturally curly hair I was apalled at the quality of this product.  First of all, it smells terrible.  Second of all, it completely dried out my hair and made it WAY frizzier than it was to begin with.  When you pour the contents of the bottle into your hand you will see what I&#x27;m talking about.  I have used products for curly/frizzy hair my entire life-Sebastian, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Kerastase....this isn&#x27;t even close to being in that league let alone the non-professionial products you can buy at any store.  Not worth the money, and pretty much not worth it at all.</li>
