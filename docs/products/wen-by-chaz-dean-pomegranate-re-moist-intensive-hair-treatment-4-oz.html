            <li>so happy to find it on line for such a great price : )</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product, I love all of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN hair products, my hair has never felt so soft and looked to great!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very fortunate not to have turned gray).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the 4 oz size.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it really moistens your hair.</li>
            <li>It has been almost two weeks, since I used the re-moist treatment, and I cannot stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>I love all wen products.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was a great product since I&#x27;ve used the original formula in the past, the pomegranate formula is just as wonderful ....</li>
            <li>I do prefer the original, not so smelly!</li>
            <li>I saw and read, on YouTube, that the Almond Mint is great for African-American natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly strong.</li>
            <li>This product feels great in my hair &amp; My hair feels nice and soft, I don&#x27;t particularly like the Pomegranate smell.</li>
            <li>gay</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell of the pomegranate</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and no longer frizzy and</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep but the product is great, I love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and healthy feeling, but with body, I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I had tried this because I thought it might be a good deep conditioner, but I had to shampoo my hair again right after using it.  </li>
            <li>It is okay so far .... haven&#x27;t used much yet to decide, but will be using more soon to make a decision</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my hair with so much bounce and shine and softness its amazing!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly useful in summer after swimming or being in the sun</li>
            <li>It has returned my hair back to it&#x27;s natural texture &amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li>This might be a good product for you if you have very dry damaged hair in need of very intensive conditioning.</li>
            <li>I purchased because my hair was coming out in the comb from other  Conditioners, after trying WEN noticed that hair was tangle free and  much more controllable</li>
            <li>I first heard about Wen hair products while watching Television and decided to try them since I was having problems with brittle hair.</li>
            <li>I started using WEN products last year and what I sincerely like about the product is that it does not strip my hair of the nutrients but instead nourishes my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first Wen product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel weighed down &amp; kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a wash and go system that would not DRY my hair, like so many grocery/drug store products do to my natural hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a guy didn&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>It has a gentle tingle when applied so</li>
            <li>I apply a good handful of this thick paste and comb it in with a wide-toothed comb and then wrap my head in a terry turban and leave it in overnight.</li>
            <li>However, I would not recommend the pom scent in particularly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s to give their hair treatment</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li>More trouble than it&#x27;s worth for my long hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is gross and the product did nothing in my opinion to do much of anything to my hair but make me want to wash it again!</li>
            <li>It works ok; just about as well as any other deep conditioning treatment, but it&#x27;s definitely NOT the real Wen</li>
            <li>Wen, clearly missed the mark when they made this hair repair product.</li>
            <li>Works really well for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>it stays soft</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a leave-in conditioner that makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I am a bi-racial young lady I have German,Jamaican,Italtin and Purtorican blood in my heritage.</li>
            <li>(My natural color - I never died my hair</li>
            <li>The one that I got has different packaging, different ingredients and even different print/font than the original.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use this very often, so the container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Always look forward to my next shipment and new scent.</li>
            <li>Wen gave life to my dry brittle hair and my hair color last much longer than before.</li>
            <li>First I have to admit in not a huge fan of Wen.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with dark auburn hair</li>
            <li> It lasts me a very long time, because a tiny amount, goes along ways!</li>
            <li> I got a relaxer previously and now i&#x27;m going to transition to a natural look to obtain my curls once again.</li>
            <li> I still have it after however long because I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> my doggie and i are both wen girls with long hair .............</li>
            <li> All those other conditioners just strip the hair color and make the hair look pretty dull.</li>
            <li> I have colored thick , coarse haie so far it&#x27;s the axswer i&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> Every now and then my hair gets dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT real Wen.  </li>
            <li> and this works well on my hair when I get out of the shower and put it in my hair when wet.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I have.</li>
            <li> When I first used the Pomegranate Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizzies down without weighing my hair curls down.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I used very little of this product!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, same as ordering thru the company but less expensive!  </li>
            <li> I find it to be very heavy, making my hair flat and dirty looking after \\&quot;shampooing\\&quot; with it for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> One of my least fave Wen scents</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thickly curly and oily.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so heavy and just nasty!  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed in Amazon for allowing fakes to be sold.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad perm experience and this saved my hair!</li>

            <li> Excellent product!!!  My hair is moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I have. Not crazy about it. Wouldn&#x27;t order it again and would return it if I could. I still have it after however long because I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>

            <li> Awesome product have been using it for two months now makes hair feel light and clean no oily feeling takes a bit to use but all good things take time</li>
            <li> I use Wen Conditioning Cleaner and when a friend recommended this, I tried it but saw no difference with my hair. Used it twice and just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I first heard about Wen hair products while watching Television and decided to try them since I was having problems with brittle hair. Wen gave life to my dry brittle hair and my hair color last much longer than before. All those other conditioners just strip the hair color and make the hair look pretty dull.

            <li> Great product.  Noticed texture of hair has improved greatly.  I used to have very dry hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t as tangled after a wash and holds in moisture since using Wen products.</li>
            <li> It is okay so far .... haven&#x27;t used much yet to decide, but will be using more soon to make a decision</li>
            <li> This re-moist is the best I loved it was perfect for when I colored my hair and that in between use</li>

            <li> grandmother review very good hair treatment stuff she order one of this fragrance and another that is almond she loves this stuff I tried it even though im a guy didn&#x27;t really need it but I like it a bit hair does feel different.... im not gay I just do honest reviews lol</li>
            <li> This is NOT real Wen.  The one that I got has different packaging, different ingredients and even different print/font than the original.  It works ok; just about as well as any other deep conditioning treatment, but it&#x27;s definitely NOT the real Wen Re Moist.  I am thoroughly disappointed in Amazon for allowing fakes to be sold.  I am a die-hard WEN girl and I know my Wen.  This stuff is NOT it.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell of the pomegranate and I love the 4 oz size.  I started using WEN products last year and what I sincerely like about the product is that it does not strip my hair of the nutrients but instead nourishes my hair.</li>
            <li> First I have to admit in not a huge fan of Wen.  I find it to be very heavy, making my hair flat and dirty looking after \\&quot;shampooing\\&quot; with it for a couple of days.

            <li> I have an afro and this works well on my hair when I get out of the shower and put it in my hair when wet. it stays soft</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really moistens your hair. almost no smell and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I get it cheaper on Amazon than buying it from Chaz.</li>
            <li> When I first used the Pomegranate Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, I was not impressed. The treatment takes 30 minutes! I have type 3c, in the back of my hair, and type 4a hair. I was looking for a wash and go system that would not DRY my hair, like so many grocery/drug store products do to my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I have to wash my hair about every 4 fours day and I have yet to find a leave-in conditioner that makes my hair soft. This product delivers! It has been almost two weeks, since I used the re-moist treatment, and I cannot stop touching my hair. My hair is so soft!! I used very little of this product!&lt;br /&gt;  I am going to purchase a different re-moist treatment from the Chaz product line. I saw and read, on YouTube, that the Almond Mint is great for African-American natural hair. like mine. Finally something that works!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, same as ordering thru the company but less expensive!  I do prefer the original, not so smelly!</li>
            <li> I love all wen products.  Have tried several and like them all.  Always look forward to my next shipment and new scent.</li>
            <li> This product is fabu! I am a bi-racial young lady I have German,Jamaican,Italtin and Purtorican blood in my heritage. My hair is naturally thickly curly and oily. I got a relaxer previously and now i&#x27;m going to transition to a natural look to obtain my curls once again. This product is wonderful it&#x27;s the first Wen product I&#x27;ve used, I called the company and ordered a kit after using it. It has a gentle tingle when applied so you know that it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s left my hair with so much bounce and shine and softness its amazing! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s to give their hair treatment it desvres. However, I would not recommend the pom scent in particularly. It&#x27;s highly strong.</li>
            <li> I purchased because my hair was coming out in the comb from other  Conditioners, after trying WEN noticed that hair was tangle free and  much more controllable</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizzies down without weighing my hair curls down. Great ingredients, no gluten allergies. I have bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, I love all of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN hair products, my hair has never felt so soft and looked to great!  I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with dark auburn hair and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  (My natural color - I never died my hair and I&#x27;m very fortunate not to have turned gray).</li>
            <li> More trouble than it&#x27;s worth for my long hair. Made my hair feel weighed down &amp; kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen products for about 2 yrs. It has returned my hair back to it&#x27;s natural texture &amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li> my doggie and i are both wen girls with long hair .............we are outdoors a lot and this is a great treatment</li>
            <li> Every now and then my hair gets dry and straw-like. When that happens, I wash my hair and then towel-dry it. I apply a good handful of this thick paste and comb it in with a wide-toothed comb and then wrap my head in a terry turban and leave it in overnight. The next morning, I wash it out, rinsing well. My hair is smooth and no longer frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a fruity pomegranate with some mint or menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this very often, so the container lasts a long time. It&#x27;s particularly useful in summer after swimming or being in the sun</li>
            <li> I am a Wen girl and I don&#x27;t use anything else on my hair any more!!!  This complements the conditioning &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;.  It lasts me a very long time, because a tiny amount, goes along ways!</li>
