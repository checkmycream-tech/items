            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>love it, will be buying this again soon for my roots!</li>
            <li>It is exactly the color I want and looks best on me.  </li>
            <li>and it made it look so amazing.</li>
            <li>But the Wella toner was amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This toner works amazing.</li>
            <li>I also used a clarifying treatment from Sally&#x27;s and my hair was a nice color.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this on my own.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li>what I have now is a wonderful ash blonde that I am so happy with.</li>
            <li>20 minutes should be good if your hair isn&#x27;t that light to begin with.</li>
            <li>Lightened my hair and took away most orange brassy tones very satisfied :)))</li>
            <li>Easy Peasy!</li>
            <li>but the smell is a bit strong for me, so please keep your bathroom or wherever you&#x27;re doing your hair well - ventilated!</li>
            <li>To be honest this is the best for people looking to have white/platinum blonde</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every toner out there to find the best, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I ended up leaving it on for just about 17 minutes and that was perfect for achieving a nice silver blonde color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine product, the shipping was extremely fast, and the price is good so great sellers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really takes out the brassy colors and leaves my hair a beautiful platinum.</li>
            <li>Used it with Color Charm 20 volume creme developer - turned out beautiful but was very drying</li>
            <li>Be sure to put on in a well ventilated room, the smell is strong!</li>
            <li>My hair was very light yellow(bleached) to begin with</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for us folks that like to go blonde</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and worked perfectly to remove the brassy tones from my blonde hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>thought maybe it was the developer, but I&#x27;ve had more than one hairdresser tell me that it&#x27;s the toner, not the developer.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair twice (with purple shampoo) most of the toner washed out.</li>
            <li>but maybe I would have had better results)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says not to leave it on for more than 30 minutes...</li>
            <li>my hair wouldve looked even better, but I am still pleased with the turn out.</li>
            <li>This seller charges more than others for some reason</li>
            <li>Do your research before purchasing - this applies to everything though :)</li>
            <li>The results are better.</li>
            <li>You will wash most of it away.  </li>
            <li>THE best for toning out yellow shades.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the purple tones out with another clarifying treatment (from Sally&#x27;s) along with dandruff shampoo and I like the end color better than the T18 toner</li>
            <li>a perfect frosty blonde..  </li>
            <li>It was to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even imagine letting it sit on my head for more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off with just getting a haircolor as a toner.</li>
            <li>With that said make sure</li>
            <li>Great price came fast</li>
            <li>so it is best to put it in your hair as quickly as possible</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>ive used this a bunch of times and always love the results.</li>
            <li>Even when my hair is a darker blonde with brassy tones it makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>I found many blogs writing about this product</li>
            <li>Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took most of the brassy orange from my bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Not hideous, I almost love it, but not quite the color I was expecting.    </li>
            <li>make sure to use 10 or 20 volume developer only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review within a year and adjust the rating, if appropriate.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and followed the instructions, watching my hair to make sure it didn&#x27;t go to purple.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with Virgin Snow.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>salon&#x27;s I leave with an ok with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times</li>
            <li>I panic&#x27;d and rinse prematurely even though I knew better.  </li>
            <li>a test is your best reassurance, as big of a pain as it is.  </li>
            <li>but I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>Most people on YouTube say 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I recommend that you also watch the many YouTube videos on this product to be sure that you understand what to do.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite, I can&#x27;t highlight my hair without it.</li>
            <li>and then I tone it afterwards with this for 30 minutes and just like magic</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>pro so research and make sure you&#x27;re safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lift, so the layer under was still a touch darker, but it made it much much more even.</li>
            <li>I think about 10 minutes would have been even better, and I plan on re-doing it soon.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it MANY times.</li>
            <li>but after using some semi permanent box colors my hair had that brassy orange look on the top.</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>I love love the result.</li>
            <li>This has always been my holy grail toner :)</li>
            <li>I have beautiful blonde hair - love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Pretty good results, but hope it continues to improve my color over time.</li>
            <li>The T14 toner did not look very good on my virgin hair that was bleached (lemon yellow level/white level) however, so a mix or doing each part separately is advised.</li>
            <li>want to make sure people know it is not, this is &#x27;Light Ash Blond.</li>
            <li>So this stuff is seriously good and can really pack a punch on brass.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; follow the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li>but my goodness, this smelled so strong</li>
            <li>as any toner is, its smells really strong</li>
            <li>Had better results just using Shimmering Lights Shampoo under a showercap for 40 minutes and in ratio that is much more cost-effective (and compartively, more effective in general).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After five minutes my hair was a beautiful white ash platinum.</li>
            <li>It will kind of make it look gray for the first couple days but subsides.</li>
            <li>It was beautifully done but still a bit alarmingly yellow to me.</li>
            <li>The packaging was kinda jacked up but the product was fine.</li>
            <li>and I will be just fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, consult a stylist before you use these toners to fine out what reaction your hair might have.</li>
            <li>Bleaching your hair alone wont do that, if you use this toner once every 6 months along with bleaching, your hair will lighten up quick!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I already washed most of it out</li>
            <li>Perfect color, it toned down all the brassiness!</li>
            <li>a huge 10</li>
            <li>This works great for getting rid of the residual yellow</li>
            <li>My hair is still light but not  grey/white</li>
            <li>When I lived in Florida I went to a fantastic lady who made my hair platinum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest buying a tub of purple dye, and then mixing it with conditioner and dying your hair a light purple and just letting it fade.</li>
            <li>but after bleaching my hair to as light as i could i used this</li>
            <li>If its light they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.  </li>
            <li>My hair was already as light I as I could get it with bleach</li>
            <li>When it dried it was perfect.</li>
            <li>hair is now pastel mint (which is what I was trying to achieve by using a sonic green diluted hair dye) and it&#x27;s marvelous!</li>
            <li>Amazing results and arrived here super fast!</li>
            <li>I really do know what I&#x27;m talking about!!!</li>
            <li>After a thorough application, I went right back to that white/silver (arctic fox looking) color that I loved!</li>
            <li>and it worked great for getting my hair super white blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will not strip your color, but will only deposit to counteract brassiness (and do an amazing job at that!).</li>
            <li>I just wish that the results lasted a bit longer, because having that silvery white hair was amazing!</li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair it made it a really pretty sunny blonde color :) I liked it!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t look around more first before purchasing.</li>
            <li>This is a great toner but do NOT leave it on your hair too long</li>
            <li>My best advice is, better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>this is the original T-18--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be rich if I had a $1.00 for every time I heard and still hear,</li>
            <li>Just play it safe the first time.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that this arrive expired, As I have bought it from sally&#x27;s and had zero problems with it.</li>
            <li>I took off a star because it made my hair even more dry than before, but I did leave this on there for a good 30-40 min to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toner I have used to get the platinum blonde shade I have always wanted.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the color I got using this mixed with T11 toner and a 20 developer on my pre-lightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results were fantastic--a silvery beigey color very complementary for my skin &amp; eye color--no more brassy blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also avoid washing it more than a couple times a week to really extend it.</li>
            <li>Will leave my hair a gorgeous white.</li>
            <li>It toned a bit of the brassy red tint out of my hair, which I was delighted with, but it wasn&#x27;t a drastic change.</li>
            <li>Two bottles would really get the job done better than one.</li>
            <li>I love it and will absolutely use this product again.</li>
            <li>but you really have to get the timing of it down perfectly or else</li>
            <li>Excellent product and seems to be the only one on the market to give you true Marilyn Monroe platinum blonde.  </li>
            <li>I used it after taking my hair from a level 10 to a level 1 at my roots and 2 at my ends (my ends were stubborn) it got rid of my yellow to the perfect shade of cool platinum blonde, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best lighting but at least it is consistent!</li>
            <li>I found more and more yellow roots.</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm or cold water after toning for best results.  </li>
            <li>Since toners are semi-permanent, they do fade off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>, it has quickly become a staple in my *ahem</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this toner, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it.</li>
            <li>I was a level 8 and from the very first impression of it, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Your hair does have to be pretty light though.</li>
            <li>this color deposited the right amount of grey-blue tones to make my hair the perfect blonde that I needed in only one application.</li>
            <li>worked pretty good, turned hair close to white</li>
            <li>It definitely takes the orange/brass out pretty good though.</li>
            <li>and I got pretty depressed!</li>
            <li>Had a little more orange than I liked</li>
            <li>Works best if you can get your hair to a pure yellow, if not, you&#x27;ll end up an ashy brown/dirty blonde as opposed to silvery.</li>
            <li>it really gets the bright white</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is amazing for banishing orange brassy tones and removing slightly yellow tones.</li>
            <li>Not like it, did not lightened my hair even when it was light orangy color ready bleached</li>
            <li>This stuff is POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li>The only issue with this was my own mistake - I was in a race to get this because of an event I was going to</li>
            <li>I was a lovely silver color except for my roots, which remained light yellow (as in inside of banana peel).</li>
            <li>My natural color, by the way, is salt and pepper on top and steel gray in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this toner, my hair is sexy platinum, not the old gray mare.</li>
            <li>you know what kind of blonde you want to be.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love this toner.</li>
            <li>, I did not apply this to freshly bleached hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also economical.</li>
            <li>My roots though were lighter than the rest of my hair (since my hair was dyed before bleaching and my roots had grown out) and it turned the roots a reeeally nice silvery blonde color.</li>
            <li>my hair absorbed the purple, didnt like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and for the first few days it leaves my hair a gorgeous pastel lavender colour.</li>
            <li>Which is install, But I did not look  like the super hot girls on Instagram.</li>
            <li>Wella makes great products but seems to be the only one who makes a true platinum blonde product.  </li>
            <li>Wella&#x27;s T-18 knocks that right out and can be used right after bleaching for white/platinum</li>
            <li>once i figure out the right processing time for my hair.</li>
            <li>If I left it on for the directed amount of time, I&#x27;d have a full head of purple hair (that looks mostly gray).  </li>
            <li>It turned the first couple inches of my roots a nice color, but beyond that, it left sections of my hair yellowy and turned the bottoms darkish gray.</li>
            <li>for dark hair blue is the best with this.bleach.</li>
            <li>oK,  if anyone knows hair trouble I feel strongly I qualify!  </li>
            <li>It is so soft in color and texture and soooo sophisticated looking that you would swear that it was professionally done, but at a most reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>* VERY LARGE hair product collection.</li>
            <li>Next time I will use Wella T10 (Ivory Lady toner) after I bleach for less than 10 minutes and do my best to NOT touch hair already bleached.</li>
            <li>I hear a lot of positive things said about this product, but my own hair must be too porous because after a bleaching, I can only leave this on my hair maybe 5 minutes before everything literally turns purple.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, delicate color.</li>
            <li>If you simply put the toner over orange hair you will not be satisfied with your hair guaranteed and it is of NO fault to the product, but simply your own fault.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reviews from everyone, you helped me find my true self.</li>
            <li>Once I had bleached my hair to a light banana yellow (from a dark brown), I used this to pull the rest of the yellow/brass out and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>Amazing pure white toner.</li>
            <li>it hurts if youve  just done some hvy duty bleaching, but sooo worth it the color it produced &#x3D; beautiful white color, but not natural, somewhat surreal</li>
            <li>IT works perfect and it didnt destroy my hair , i mixed it with a  20 vol.</li>
            <li>Also, if your hair is super orange, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s altogether a bit darker than it was, but looks less rooty, which is good.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>great for toning the yellow blonde to ash, can&#x27;t stand the golden/brassy tones!</li>
            <li>It fades quickly to my normal platinum blonde, but I sure enjoy the purple tint while it lasts.</li>
            <li>SURE YOUR HAIR IS THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE if using right after bleaching- works better:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very gentle.</li>
            <li>When applying and while developing this product turned my hair very very lavender.</li>
            <li>and although I am lucky and tan easily I still was self-conscious to be different.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve, plus the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>It will look blue but it will successfully take out all the yellow and make it took white/grey.</li>
            <li>I applied this to my roots first then immediately on my ends.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are mixing this entire bottle with 20 V (volume) developer.  </li>
            <li>so I definitely overpaid on top of the one day shipping charge.</li>
            <li>I bleach first with a 30 volume developer.</li>
            <li>the places where is it purple is where it is most white.</li>
            <li>First time I used this toner, and for exactly the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>this was my first time</li>
            <li>but this one was able to help strip the color from my hair to make it white in no time.</li>
            <li>first and this time as well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair many many times from black/brown only to find that I have orange, yellow sometimes even pinkish tones in parts of my hair.</li>
            <li>sure if i just didn&#x27;t put enough product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty burned.</li>
            <li>Did not eliminate most yellow tones.</li>
            <li>I think if I had left on another 5-10 minutes, the color would&#x27;ve been more platinum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually trying to &amp;#34;go silver&amp;#34; to blend in the gray/silver/blond better.  </li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, it looked appropriately toned, and I rinsed and deep conditioned it.</li>
            <li>I have always used the Wella Wellite Creme Lightener with oil for the first step.</li>
            <li>Now I am blonde and I love t18 after and in between color.  </li>
            <li>I should haved left in in longer because I wish it was lightened a bit more</li>
            <li>Only tips I have are to watch the color closely and do not rinse when it looks steely gray, wait 5 more minutes</li>
            <li>And I feel that the orange parts actually turned MORE orangey.</li>
            <li>Turned my light yellow hair a more natural hue.  </li>
            <li>This worked pretty well to get rid of the orange tint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the T18 toner to my hair with a 20 volume developer also by wella and let it sit for almost exactly 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed to get my color even all over.</li>
            <li>My hair is now a lovely shade of ashy, but still slightly golden blonde (think Taylor Swift) that I really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural color and doesn&#x27;t clash with my dark eyebrows like the yellow-blonde did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - great product.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, I love it.</li>
            <li>Never fails to deliver.</li>
            <li>I am bleaching my hair for the first time and after the glowing reviews of this product, i had to buy it and try it out.</li>
            <li>i really like this toner!</li>
            <li>I normally have light brown hair that does not lift easy died blonde over 15 years.</li>
            <li>This toner is very strong, so do be careful to monitor it, especially if you have very light or porus hair.</li>
            <li>Be sure that you bring your hair to a very very light blonde first and test strand to see how long to leave it on.  </li>
            <li>The second time I left the color in a bit longer than I planned, and when I washed it out my hair was silvery grey, it was very beautiful.</li>
            <li>While this DID change my roots to a nice platinum color it turned the rest of my long hair a silverly tone because it was already a light blonde.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to use the whole bottle, but really unless your hair is super duper long, you should be able to get 2 uses from each package of this.</li>
            <li>T-14 is better if you want a lesser effect (normal blonde) and T-10 is better if you want more of a beige toned blonde.</li>
            <li>Had a nice, natural medium blonde shade.</li>
            <li>If you do, it seems to me that, logically, your hair would be more porous after bleaching so you might not need to leave it on as long.</li>
            <li>Toned out all the orange in my hair and left my hair a gorgeous platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>This seller got me the product pretty fast</li>
            <li>The yellow parts of my hair got more neutral and the orange parts toned down a lot, but my hair is still very warm overall.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty light blonde then</li>
            <li>I did not personally notice any damage from using this toner, but it does have a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I end up at the pale yellow stage, then apply the T18 and its a beautiful white/blonde.</li>
            <li>So I did my new growth and brought my hair up one more shade and waited until the next day to tone all over.</li>
            <li>It does dry it out though so get some good deep conditioner</li>
            <li>but I feel like I would have gotten better results if I had used Quick Blue which I will use next time.</li>
            <li>It seems that going to lavender first and letting it fade out gets your hair to a better white, while going straight to the color you want will simply cause it to fade a bit more yellow when it settles.</li>
            <li>It you are looking to go platinum, this is a great tonar, but be very careful you don&#x27;t leave it on long, as it can turn your hair purple or gray.</li>
            <li>I had my hair professionally bleached to a very very light blonde.</li>
            <li>later lol after I bleach the color out of it the lightest I can get it without breaking off THAN toning it with a silver toner ten minutes like the last time and or maybe in between dyes and bleaches mix the toner with conditioner and if u really want to spice it up mix the toner with ur bleach</li>
            <li>am so bummed, because I really like the color I got.</li>
            <li>you can never get out after a straight bleach.</li>
            <li>The only way to get that light blond look with a drugstore hair color is to use a toner like this.  </li>
            <li>just BE Careful and make sure you are doing the 1:2 ratio.  </li>
            <li>It took me much online research and looking at youtube videos.  </li>
            <li>It was &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; according some salon attendant</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this toner again since I wanted to give it another chance.</li>
            <li>It comes so highly suggested!</li>
            <li>but this product did&#x27;t really do this job for the look that i was going for.</li>
            <li>Test strip proved uneventful at 30 min, so processed whole head according to the box directions for 40 minutes almost.</li>
            <li>Got it fast as I asked for two day shipping.</li>
            <li>I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li>So much so that I didn&#x27;t want to wait weeks for an appointment at my stylists.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work with orange/ginger hair.</li>
            <li>and I think I added too much developer (Wella 20 v developer).</li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair it turned out really brassy.  </li>
            <li>When I got home and got ready to tone</li>
            <li>, also my hair was lightened to a sort of sunny orange color and not all the way to a light blonde, so that was probably a factor as well.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but only took my hair to light ash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The product I received is not &#x27;White Lady&#x27; but the newer formulation now called &#x27;Light Ash Blond.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and when I have my roots touched up, they are sometimes brassy.</li>
            <li>Made my natural silver roots more white though, which I wasn&#x27;t looking for at this time.  </li>
            <li>So I think if you bleach your hair up to that light yellow color, it will bring out the yellow brassiness and turn your hair into a nice, gentle ash blonde.</li>
            <li>I continued to experiment with achieving the platinum soft silvery pale blond and finally found the right combination for my hair, which is very fine and prone to breaking when using strong chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm to take away brassiness out of hair and whitened my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Using this toner, or any other chemical is &amp;#34;double processing&amp;#34; and will stress/damage hair more each time.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I was worried that if I left this product on my hair too long that it would stay lavender.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who wish to reach a very pale white blonde color.</li>
            <li>toned my bleached hair to a nice ashy color in 15 minutes, though it left my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I still was left with some orangey spots and the color overall was very yellow and bright.</li>
            <li>I have only used box dye drugstore products up until this point, so I was hoping for a true miracle.</li>
            <li>I probably should have gotten a different shade since my hair was more orange than yellow, but I had already invested so much into this (paying for one day shipping) and I was running out of time, so I went for it anyway.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting to stay bleached and you keep up on it, eventually you will not need to use this toner because you will be white already :) the only other time I think that this toner will be needed is if you have troubles with your roots when touching them up.</li>
            <li>I started with very neon yellow hair after 4 blonding treatments with two different products (Kaleidocolor Blue and Wella Lightest Ash Blond 12/81 back and forth, the Kaleidocolor worked much better and was better scented)</li>
            <li>Even my brother, who is less than observant most of the time, noticed and complimented it.</li>
            <li>I think I should&#x27;ve kept the bleach on my hair longer ( I used Quick Blue )</li>
            <li>okay - had to use purple shampoo and conditioner to get the last of the yellow out.  </li>
            <li>This is purple and will only work it&#x27;s magic on the yellow.</li>
            <li>Okay product but white lady does not make your hair fully white</li>
            <li>I think I could have left it on a bit longer to get a bit more white -</li>
            <li>I used 20vol developer and started where the hair was darkest and most yellow, left it in for about seven minutes, then pulled it through to the whiter areas for about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought two and one of them happened to actually work.</li>
            <li>Tried for quite some time to get my already super blond hair white.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use purple shampoo when you wash your hair to keep the brassy colors away and help maintain the white blonde look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I used the whole bottle and left it on for about 20 minutes, and it didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s some high praise from</li>
            <li>I had high</li>
            <li>I love White Lady by Wella as it gives my hair a soft white color, very platinum looking.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend, and don&#x27;t forget a level 20 developer if you are toning bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find another toner that works a little better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>(I am lucky to have no grey and hear I&#x27;ll go white first but who knows.</li>
            <li>It felt more dead than ever, more dead than bleaching it.</li>
            <li>- just went back to grey and using the purple shampoo - looks better</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is towel dried.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks after touching up my roots I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own bleaching of dark hair to blonde for years</li>
            <li>and I get highlights normally</li>
            <li>it tones right to a platinum color with one application, and a white/gray after a second application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may need two bottles if you have super long hair or plan on toning all of your hair.</li>
            <li>works great, be careful if used with blue can damage, but makes it white, if you want it that white.</li>
            <li>, I do see that it says in the description \\&quot;(New</li>
            <li>the color did not process at all your best getting stuff actually at salons, at least their not watered down versions.</li>
            <li>It helped, but did NOT make it white and believe me, my hair was LIGHT and already white in some places.  </li>
            <li>I should have left it in the full hour the first time, but I fixed that with a second application and my hair is pure white now!</li>
            <li>it really looks so much nicer than raw bleached hair because it eliminates or neutralizes brassy spots and yellow spots, making the hair look more professionally done.</li>
            <li>but the green faded pretty quickly~</li>
            <li>I used this toner and my hair came out soft and natual looking!</li>
            <li>Also, I have pretty short hair, so I had plenty of the product to cover everything.</li>
            <li>It left my hair a much more platinum blonde color compared to the orangey yellow</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, I could tell my scalp was a vivid purple (this toner is violet based).  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments from my professional color stylist friends, too!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>the before and after picture are taken in the exact same lighting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People everywhere are scrambling to find the last of the true &#x27;White Lady&#x27; bottles as despite Wella&#x27;s claim that it is the same formula most of us are getting less than white results since the change.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the &#x27;White Lady&#x27; title up top there makes us think it is &#x27;White Lady&#x27; (NOT an unreasonable assumption IMO)</li>
            <li>I did this twice over 14 days, but still wanted a shade I could live with as my natural color grew out, I researched online &amp; found Wella Color Charm toners, specifically T18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and easily applied so you really don&#x27;t need much to cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked it because it softened the bleached deep yellow blond to a slightly paler version version of blond.  </li>
            <li>just wish it had been the real &#x27;White Lady&#x27; as I would not have ordered it if I had been certain that it was not.</li>
            <li>, my scalp is pretty raw right now</li>
            <li>This product along with the Wella Cream Charm Liquid Clear Developer 20 Volume did the trick.  </li>
            <li>I used 1 bottle with 2 parts 20 vol clear developer and allowed to process for 15 min.</li>
            <li>like, it actually was very soft.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>so..I&#x27;m a natural medium Blond.  </li>
            <li>will be light lavender in just a few places.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in two instances so far:</li>
            <li>after bleach with 10/20vol developer (Wella Color Charm developer is my recommendation) and with 10vol developer directly on virgin hair.</li>
            <li>in mind as well that I&#x27;m not allergic to ANY hair dyes both professional or box dye kits</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really tricky and the entire time you&#x27;re doing that, your scalp is probably going to be stinging and burning.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a lasting colour, this really isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>I had always believed that when my naturally auburn hair turned gray, it would have the silvery look I&#x27;ve always admired on others.</li>
            <li>It did very well with evening out the overall blond color and diminished the orange blond strands.  </li>
            <li>The color of the highlighted areas improved considerably.</li>
            <li>Reviews warn you not to leave it in too long or your hair will become gray or purple, but also make sure you leave it in long enough.</li>
            <li>I am one of those brown haired girls that wants blonde hair</li>
            <li>and I wanted to completely remove any and all yellowing.</li>
            <li>so we think we&#x27;re getting the old</li>
            <li>i have dyed gray hair, and i recommend it for people who want blonde, white, or gray hair, because (after bleaching to a light banana yellow)</li>
            <li>I only needed 10 minutes, and nearly a month later, it&#x27;s still keeping my yellow areas more neutral to ashy blonde.</li>
            <li>package says wait 20 mins but watch your hair closely as it processes &amp; rinse it out as soon as you achieve desired tone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Tho my hair is still a nice pale ashy blonde color the silvery part faded out after several days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After bleaching, I usually have a brassy color to my hair (super frustrating for me) and this toner was great at lightening up the blonde.</li>
            <li>Only had to leave on for 5 minutes--I would be careful about leaving on for the full 30 as it could turn your hair purple.  </li>
            <li>When I first went from box-dyed red hair to salon-dyed platinum, my hair actually had a white/silver look to it for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>After settling for less than desirable drug store shade of Super Light Ash, I finally buckled down and went to Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and i knew that it was a good thing when it turned purple blue, but when my timer beeped and i washed my hair my already shimmer lights toned hair just turned back to its ugly lightly bleached color or did nothing at all, no lighter no whiter :</li>
            <li>Just be careful you don&#x27;t leave it on TOO long if your hair is porous or already very pale as it WILL turn your hair a funny grey color, but if that happens, a couple washes with a clarifying shampoo and you&#x27;ll be all good.</li>
            <li>Took the yellow right out disnt leave it grey or purple and my hair is not like straw.</li>
            <li>White Lady did sound odd to me.</li>
            <li>It is not &amp;#34;white lady&amp;#34;,  it  isa light ash blonde toner--a blonde shade was not what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t immediately tone after bleaching anymore as the bleaching process is already pretty rough on my hair.</li>
            <li>toner for most people should not be left on this long unless you have black hair....</li>
            <li>Originally I used Wella White Lady toner (T18) all over my entire hair for 30 minutes after bleaching my roots (BE CAREFUL:</li>
            <li>I only have to lighten the new growth (7th stage with 1 activator)</li>
            <li>I give it only 4 stars because it&#x27;s mysterious to find out how to really use this if you are not a cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li>AT LEAST one more time to get it to a yellow state.</li>
            <li>The highlighted parts of my hair were starting to turn really brassy, which looks totally trailer trash- it was driving me nuts!</li>
            <li>This color can be hard to find at Sally&#x27;s, so lucky for me, I have Amazon Prime!  </li>
            <li>I use a half bottle almost every week with a double portion of 20 volume developer to keep my blonde free of yellows or reds.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t even super dry as expected.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After about a week, the dark gray turned lighter, but it&#x27;s still very much gray.</li>
            <li>Read reviews all over the internet which highly recommended only keeping on 10 minutes, though the directions state can be left on up to 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they can&#x27;t use this toner on clients for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>From barely even working to working too well...</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to reduce the yellow/orange/copper color of my roommates blonde (she is naturally a brunette).</li>
            <li>Bleach your hair as far as it will go and this will turn it white</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair naturally that pulls heavy gold when messed with.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair twice to get it to a pale yellow color and then used this toner after hearing such fantastic things about it.</li>
            <li>This reduced the brassiness, but now my hair has a slight golden hue, with white/ash blonde streaks.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that i didn&#x27;t wanna further damage my hair, i had two options, wait a few days and do a quick lighten and then tone, or</li>
            <li>With that hint from other reviewers (thank you), I was able to get the blonde I had been wanting (if only for a little while, since of course it fades/washes out/whatever).</li>
            <li>I recently decided to go from my natural medium blonde to white/platinum.</li>
            <li>The other thing you can do is buy a strand of human blonde hair and test this product on it first if you have never used it.  </li>
            <li>I love the color now, and mix/use less than half of this toner (read the included proportion instructions) to cover my long hair.  </li>
            <li>read on a few sites that you NEED to use this RIGHT AFTER bleaching the final time.</li>
            <li>but yeah, it barely did anything even though I left it on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not purple and not grey.  </li>
            <li>I first went back from black to blonde</li>
            <li>As long as your hair is at least a light yellowish color</li>
            <li>While I wish the less damaging toners would work, the use of developer and chemical process of this one is what makes the toner really WORK.</li>
            <li>so the recommended 20-30 minutes wasn&#x27;t near long enough for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight black (I&#x27;m half Japanese), but I&#x27;ve had my hair pure snow</li>
            <li>Leave on longer if needed, but be aware that other reviews state hair can turn blue or silver if left on too long.  </li>
            <li>is the blue stuff, them the 40 cream, for blondes or dark blonde this will make it pure white.</li>
            <li>I was red when it wasn&#x27;t so cool to be red, or at least that was my thinking.  </li>
            <li>I usually know if the first 15 minutes of color if the person knows what they are doing because my roots should look very dark in order to first cut the red during the color process.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with the Wella Color Charm 20 Volume Developer and it tones all of the copper/brassy hues out of my bleached hair (naturally jet black) to a completely platinum, white color.</li>
            <li>I have naturally light brown hair that I have been dying dark (almost black) for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is ABSOLUTELY TRUE that you should not leave it on for as long as it instructs, unless you want a dull purple/maroon.</li>

            <li> and I love the color it gave me!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> love it, will be buying this again soon for my roots!</li>
            <li> It is exactly the color I want and looks best on me.  </li>
            <li> and it made it look so amazing.</li>
            <li> But the Wella toner was amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This toner works amazing.</li>
            <li> I also used a clarifying treatment from Sally&#x27;s and my hair was a nice color.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this on my own.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> what I have now is a wonderful ash blonde that I am so happy with.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes should be good if your hair isn&#x27;t that light to begin with.</li>
            <li> Lightened my hair and took away most orange brassy tones very satisfied :)))</li>
            <li> Easy Peasy!</li>
            <li> but the smell is a bit strong for me, so please keep your bathroom or wherever you&#x27;re doing your hair well - ventilated!</li>
            <li> To be honest this is the best for people looking to have white/platinum blonde</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every toner out there to find the best, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving it on for just about 17 minutes and that was perfect for achieving a nice silver blonde color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine product, the shipping was extremely fast, and the price is good so great sellers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really takes out the brassy colors and leaves my hair a beautiful platinum.</li>
            <li> Used it with Color Charm 20 volume creme developer - turned out beautiful but was very drying</li>
            <li> Be sure to put on in a well ventilated room, the smell is strong!</li>
            <li> My hair was very light yellow(bleached) to begin with</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for us folks that like to go blonde</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked perfectly to remove the brassy tones from my blonde hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> thought maybe it was the developer, but I&#x27;ve had more than one hairdresser tell me that it&#x27;s the toner, not the developer.  </li>
            <li> After washing my hair twice (with purple shampoo) most of the toner washed out.</li>
            <li> but maybe I would have had better results)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says not to leave it on for more than 30 minutes...</li>
            <li> my hair wouldve looked even better, but I am still pleased with the turn out.</li>
            <li> This seller charges more than others for some reason</li>
            <li> Do your research before purchasing - this applies to everything though :)</li>
            <li> The results are better.</li>
            <li> You will wash most of it away.  </li>
            <li> THE best for toning out yellow shades.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the purple tones out with another clarifying treatment (from Sally&#x27;s) along with dandruff shampoo and I like the end color better than the T18 toner</li>
            <li> a perfect frosty blonde..  </li>
            <li> It was to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even imagine letting it sit on my head for more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off with just getting a haircolor as a toner.</li>
            <li> With that said make sure</li>
            <li> Great price came fast</li>
            <li> so it is best to put it in your hair as quickly as possible</li>
            <li> I love this toner.</li>
            <li> ive used this a bunch of times and always love the results.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair is a darker blonde with brassy tones it makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> I found many blogs writing about this product</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took most of the brassy orange from my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Not hideous, I almost love it, but not quite the color I was expecting.    </li>
            <li> make sure to use 10 or 20 volume developer only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review within a year and adjust the rating, if appropriate.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and followed the instructions, watching my hair to make sure it didn&#x27;t go to purple.</li>
            <li> I had better luck with Virgin Snow.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> salon&#x27;s I leave with an ok with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times</li>
            <li> I panic&#x27;d and rinse prematurely even though I knew better.  </li>
            <li> a test is your best reassurance, as big of a pain as it is.  </li>
            <li> but I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> Most people on YouTube say 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I recommend that you also watch the many YouTube videos on this product to be sure that you understand what to do.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite, I can&#x27;t highlight my hair without it.</li>
            <li> and then I tone it afterwards with this for 30 minutes and just like magic</li>
            <li> I love this toner.</li>
            <li> pro so research and make sure you&#x27;re safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lift, so the layer under was still a touch darker, but it made it much much more even.</li>
            <li> I think about 10 minutes would have been even better, and I plan on re-doing it soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it MANY times.</li>
            <li> but after using some semi permanent box colors my hair had that brassy orange look on the top.</li>
            <li> Lovely color.</li>
            <li> I love love the result.</li>
            <li> This has always been my holy grail toner :)</li>
            <li> I have beautiful blonde hair - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Pretty good results, but hope it continues to improve my color over time.</li>
            <li> The T14 toner did not look very good on my virgin hair that was bleached (lemon yellow level/white level) however, so a mix or doing each part separately is advised.</li>
            <li> want to make sure people know it is not, this is &#x27;Light Ash Blond.</li>
            <li> So this stuff is seriously good and can really pack a punch on brass.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; follow the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li> but my goodness, this smelled so strong</li>
            <li> as any toner is, its smells really strong</li>
            <li> Had better results just using Shimmering Lights Shampoo under a showercap for 40 minutes and in ratio that is much more cost-effective (and compartively, more effective in general).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After five minutes my hair was a beautiful white ash platinum.</li>
            <li> It will kind of make it look gray for the first couple days but subsides.</li>
            <li> It was beautifully done but still a bit alarmingly yellow to me.</li>
            <li> The packaging was kinda jacked up but the product was fine.</li>
            <li> and I will be just fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, consult a stylist before you use these toners to fine out what reaction your hair might have.</li>
            <li> Bleaching your hair alone wont do that, if you use this toner once every 6 months along with bleaching, your hair will lighten up quick!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I already washed most of it out</li>
            <li> Perfect color, it toned down all the brassiness!</li>
            <li> a huge 10</li>
            <li> This works great for getting rid of the residual yellow</li>
            <li> My hair is still light but not  grey/white</li>
            <li> When I lived in Florida I went to a fantastic lady who made my hair platinum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest buying a tub of purple dye, and then mixing it with conditioner and dying your hair a light purple and just letting it fade.</li>
            <li> but after bleaching my hair to as light as i could i used this</li>
            <li> If its light they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.  </li>
            <li> My hair was already as light I as I could get it with bleach</li>
            <li> When it dried it was perfect.</li>
            <li> hair is now pastel mint (which is what I was trying to achieve by using a sonic green diluted hair dye) and it&#x27;s marvelous!</li>
            <li> Amazing results and arrived here super fast!</li>
            <li> I really do know what I&#x27;m talking about!!!</li>
            <li> After a thorough application, I went right back to that white/silver (arctic fox looking) color that I loved!</li>
            <li> and it worked great for getting my hair super white blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will not strip your color, but will only deposit to counteract brassiness (and do an amazing job at that!).</li>
            <li> I just wish that the results lasted a bit longer, because having that silvery white hair was amazing!</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair it made it a really pretty sunny blonde color :) I liked it!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t look around more first before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner but do NOT leave it on your hair too long</li>
            <li> My best advice is, better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> this is the original T-18--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be rich if I had a $1.00 for every time I heard and still hear,</li>
            <li> Just play it safe the first time.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that this arrive expired, As I have bought it from sally&#x27;s and had zero problems with it.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because it made my hair even more dry than before, but I did leave this on there for a good 30-40 min to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toner I have used to get the platinum blonde shade I have always wanted.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color I got using this mixed with T11 toner and a 20 developer on my pre-lightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results were fantastic--a silvery beigey color very complementary for my skin &amp; eye color--no more brassy blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also avoid washing it more than a couple times a week to really extend it.</li>
            <li> Will leave my hair a gorgeous white.</li>
            <li> It toned a bit of the brassy red tint out of my hair, which I was delighted with, but it wasn&#x27;t a drastic change.</li>
            <li> Two bottles would really get the job done better than one.</li>
            <li> I love it and will absolutely use this product again.</li>
            <li> but you really have to get the timing of it down perfectly or else</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seems to be the only one on the market to give you true Marilyn Monroe platinum blonde.  </li>
            <li> I used it after taking my hair from a level 10 to a level 1 at my roots and 2 at my ends (my ends were stubborn) it got rid of my yellow to the perfect shade of cool platinum blonde, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best lighting but at least it is consistent!</li>
            <li> I found more and more yellow roots.</li>
            <li> Rinse with warm or cold water after toning for best results.  </li>
            <li> Since toners are semi-permanent, they do fade off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> , it has quickly become a staple in my *ahem</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this toner, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it.</li>
            <li> I was a level 8 and from the very first impression of it, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Your hair does have to be pretty light though.</li>
            <li> this color deposited the right amount of grey-blue tones to make my hair the perfect blonde that I needed in only one application.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good, turned hair close to white</li>
            <li> It definitely takes the orange/brass out pretty good though.</li>
            <li> and I got pretty depressed!</li>
            <li> Had a little more orange than I liked</li>
            <li> Works best if you can get your hair to a pure yellow, if not, you&#x27;ll end up an ashy brown/dirty blonde as opposed to silvery.</li>
            <li> it really gets the bright white</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is amazing for banishing orange brassy tones and removing slightly yellow tones.</li>
            <li> Not like it, did not lightened my hair even when it was light orangy color ready bleached</li>
            <li> This stuff is POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li> The only issue with this was my own mistake - I was in a race to get this because of an event I was going to</li>
            <li> I was a lovely silver color except for my roots, which remained light yellow (as in inside of banana peel).</li>
            <li> My natural color, by the way, is salt and pepper on top and steel gray in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this toner, my hair is sexy platinum, not the old gray mare.</li>
            <li> you know what kind of blonde you want to be.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this toner.</li>
            <li> , I did not apply this to freshly bleached hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also economical.</li>
            <li> My roots though were lighter than the rest of my hair (since my hair was dyed before bleaching and my roots had grown out) and it turned the roots a reeeally nice silvery blonde color.</li>
            <li> my hair absorbed the purple, didnt like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and for the first few days it leaves my hair a gorgeous pastel lavender colour.</li>
            <li> Which is install, But I did not look  like the super hot girls on Instagram.</li>
            <li> Wella makes great products but seems to be the only one who makes a true platinum blonde product.  </li>
            <li> Wella&#x27;s T-18 knocks that right out and can be used right after bleaching for white/platinum</li>
            <li> once i figure out the right processing time for my hair.</li>
            <li> If I left it on for the directed amount of time, I&#x27;d have a full head of purple hair (that looks mostly gray).  </li>
            <li> It turned the first couple inches of my roots a nice color, but beyond that, it left sections of my hair yellowy and turned the bottoms darkish gray.</li>
            <li> for dark hair blue is the best with this.bleach.</li>
            <li> oK,  if anyone knows hair trouble I feel strongly I qualify!  </li>
            <li> It is so soft in color and texture and soooo sophisticated looking that you would swear that it was professionally done, but at a most reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> * VERY LARGE hair product collection.</li>
            <li> Next time I will use Wella T10 (Ivory Lady toner) after I bleach for less than 10 minutes and do my best to NOT touch hair already bleached.</li>
            <li> I hear a lot of positive things said about this product, but my own hair must be too porous because after a bleaching, I can only leave this on my hair maybe 5 minutes before everything literally turns purple.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, delicate color.</li>
            <li> If you simply put the toner over orange hair you will not be satisfied with your hair guaranteed and it is of NO fault to the product, but simply your own fault.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews from everyone, you helped me find my true self.</li>
            <li> Once I had bleached my hair to a light banana yellow (from a dark brown), I used this to pull the rest of the yellow/brass out and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> Amazing pure white toner.</li>
            <li> it hurts if youve  just done some hvy duty bleaching, but sooo worth it the color it produced &#x3D; beautiful white color, but not natural, somewhat surreal</li>
            <li> IT works perfect and it didnt destroy my hair , i mixed it with a  20 vol.</li>
            <li> Also, if your hair is super orange, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s altogether a bit darker than it was, but looks less rooty, which is good.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> great for toning the yellow blonde to ash, can&#x27;t stand the golden/brassy tones!</li>
            <li> It fades quickly to my normal platinum blonde, but I sure enjoy the purple tint while it lasts.</li>
            <li> SURE YOUR HAIR IS THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE if using right after bleaching- works better:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very gentle.</li>
            <li> When applying and while developing this product turned my hair very very lavender.</li>
            <li> and although I am lucky and tan easily I still was self-conscious to be different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve, plus the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> It will look blue but it will successfully take out all the yellow and make it took white/grey.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my roots first then immediately on my ends.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are mixing this entire bottle with 20 V (volume) developer.  </li>
            <li> so I definitely overpaid on top of the one day shipping charge.</li>
            <li> I bleach first with a 30 volume developer.</li>
            <li> the places where is it purple is where it is most white.</li>
            <li> First time I used this toner, and for exactly the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> this was my first time</li>
            <li> but this one was able to help strip the color from my hair to make it white in no time.</li>
            <li> first and this time as well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair many many times from black/brown only to find that I have orange, yellow sometimes even pinkish tones in parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> sure if i just didn&#x27;t put enough product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty burned.</li>
            <li> Did not eliminate most yellow tones.</li>
            <li> I think if I had left on another 5-10 minutes, the color would&#x27;ve been more platinum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually trying to &amp;#34;go silver&amp;#34; to blend in the gray/silver/blond better.  </li>
            <li> After 15 minutes, it looked appropriately toned, and I rinsed and deep conditioned it.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Wella Wellite Creme Lightener with oil for the first step.</li>
            <li> Now I am blonde and I love t18 after and in between color.  </li>
            <li> I should haved left in in longer because I wish it was lightened a bit more</li>
            <li> Only tips I have are to watch the color closely and do not rinse when it looks steely gray, wait 5 more minutes</li>
            <li> And I feel that the orange parts actually turned MORE orangey.</li>
            <li> Turned my light yellow hair a more natural hue.  </li>
            <li> This worked pretty well to get rid of the orange tint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the T18 toner to my hair with a 20 volume developer also by wella and let it sit for almost exactly 9 minutes.</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed to get my color even all over.</li>
            <li> My hair is now a lovely shade of ashy, but still slightly golden blonde (think Taylor Swift) that I really like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural color and doesn&#x27;t clash with my dark eyebrows like the yellow-blonde did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - great product.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend, I love it.</li>
            <li> Never fails to deliver.</li>
            <li> I am bleaching my hair for the first time and after the glowing reviews of this product, i had to buy it and try it out.</li>
            <li> i really like this toner!</li>
            <li> I normally have light brown hair that does not lift easy died blonde over 15 years.</li>
            <li> This toner is very strong, so do be careful to monitor it, especially if you have very light or porus hair.</li>
            <li> Be sure that you bring your hair to a very very light blonde first and test strand to see how long to leave it on.  </li>
            <li> The second time I left the color in a bit longer than I planned, and when I washed it out my hair was silvery grey, it was very beautiful.</li>
            <li> While this DID change my roots to a nice platinum color it turned the rest of my long hair a silverly tone because it was already a light blonde.</li>
            <li> so I ended up having to use the whole bottle, but really unless your hair is super duper long, you should be able to get 2 uses from each package of this.</li>
            <li> T-14 is better if you want a lesser effect (normal blonde) and T-10 is better if you want more of a beige toned blonde.</li>
            <li> Had a nice, natural medium blonde shade.</li>
            <li> If you do, it seems to me that, logically, your hair would be more porous after bleaching so you might not need to leave it on as long.</li>
            <li> Toned out all the orange in my hair and left my hair a gorgeous platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> This seller got me the product pretty fast</li>
            <li> The yellow parts of my hair got more neutral and the orange parts toned down a lot, but my hair is still very warm overall.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty light blonde then</li>
            <li> I did not personally notice any damage from using this toner, but it does have a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I end up at the pale yellow stage, then apply the T18 and its a beautiful white/blonde.</li>
            <li> So I did my new growth and brought my hair up one more shade and waited until the next day to tone all over.</li>
            <li> It does dry it out though so get some good deep conditioner</li>
            <li> but I feel like I would have gotten better results if I had used Quick Blue which I will use next time.</li>
            <li> It seems that going to lavender first and letting it fade out gets your hair to a better white, while going straight to the color you want will simply cause it to fade a bit more yellow when it settles.</li>
            <li> It you are looking to go platinum, this is a great tonar, but be very careful you don&#x27;t leave it on long, as it can turn your hair purple or gray.</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally bleached to a very very light blonde.</li>
            <li> later lol after I bleach the color out of it the lightest I can get it without breaking off THAN toning it with a silver toner ten minutes like the last time and or maybe in between dyes and bleaches mix the toner with conditioner and if u really want to spice it up mix the toner with ur bleach</li>
            <li> am so bummed, because I really like the color I got.</li>
            <li> you can never get out after a straight bleach.</li>
            <li> The only way to get that light blond look with a drugstore hair color is to use a toner like this.  </li>
            <li> just BE Careful and make sure you are doing the 1:2 ratio.  </li>
            <li> It took me much online research and looking at youtube videos.  </li>
            <li> It was &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; according some salon attendant</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this toner again since I wanted to give it another chance.</li>
            <li> It comes so highly suggested!</li>
            <li> but this product did&#x27;t really do this job for the look that i was going for.</li>
            <li> Test strip proved uneventful at 30 min, so processed whole head according to the box directions for 40 minutes almost.</li>
            <li> Got it fast as I asked for two day shipping.</li>
            <li> I like it that much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li> So much so that I didn&#x27;t want to wait weeks for an appointment at my stylists.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work with orange/ginger hair.</li>
            <li> and I think I added too much developer (Wella 20 v developer).</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair it turned out really brassy.  </li>
            <li> When I got home and got ready to tone</li>
            <li> , also my hair was lightened to a sort of sunny orange color and not all the way to a light blonde, so that was probably a factor as well.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but only took my hair to light ash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product I received is not &#x27;White Lady&#x27; but the newer formulation now called &#x27;Light Ash Blond.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and when I have my roots touched up, they are sometimes brassy.</li>
            <li> Made my natural silver roots more white though, which I wasn&#x27;t looking for at this time.  </li>
            <li> So I think if you bleach your hair up to that light yellow color, it will bring out the yellow brassiness and turn your hair into a nice, gentle ash blonde.</li>
            <li> I continued to experiment with achieving the platinum soft silvery pale blond and finally found the right combination for my hair, which is very fine and prone to breaking when using strong chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm to take away brassiness out of hair and whitened my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Using this toner, or any other chemical is &amp;#34;double processing&amp;#34; and will stress/damage hair more each time.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I was worried that if I left this product on my hair too long that it would stay lavender.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who wish to reach a very pale white blonde color.</li>
            <li> toned my bleached hair to a nice ashy color in 15 minutes, though it left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I still was left with some orangey spots and the color overall was very yellow and bright.</li>
            <li> I have only used box dye drugstore products up until this point, so I was hoping for a true miracle.</li>
            <li> I probably should have gotten a different shade since my hair was more orange than yellow, but I had already invested so much into this (paying for one day shipping) and I was running out of time, so I went for it anyway.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting to stay bleached and you keep up on it, eventually you will not need to use this toner because you will be white already :) the only other time I think that this toner will be needed is if you have troubles with your roots when touching them up.</li>
            <li> I started with very neon yellow hair after 4 blonding treatments with two different products (Kaleidocolor Blue and Wella Lightest Ash Blond 12/81 back and forth, the Kaleidocolor worked much better and was better scented)</li>
            <li> Even my brother, who is less than observant most of the time, noticed and complimented it.</li>
            <li> I think I should&#x27;ve kept the bleach on my hair longer ( I used Quick Blue )</li>
            <li> okay - had to use purple shampoo and conditioner to get the last of the yellow out.  </li>
            <li> This is purple and will only work it&#x27;s magic on the yellow.</li>
            <li> Okay product but white lady does not make your hair fully white</li>
            <li> I think I could have left it on a bit longer to get a bit more white -</li>
            <li> I used 20vol developer and started where the hair was darkest and most yellow, left it in for about seven minutes, then pulled it through to the whiter areas for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought two and one of them happened to actually work.</li>
            <li> Tried for quite some time to get my already super blond hair white.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use purple shampoo when you wash your hair to keep the brassy colors away and help maintain the white blonde look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I used the whole bottle and left it on for about 20 minutes, and it didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s some high praise from</li>
            <li> I had high</li>
            <li> I love White Lady by Wella as it gives my hair a soft white color, very platinum looking.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend, and don&#x27;t forget a level 20 developer if you are toning bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to find another toner that works a little better for my hair type.</li>
            <li> (I am lucky to have no grey and hear I&#x27;ll go white first but who knows.</li>
            <li> It felt more dead than ever, more dead than bleaching it.</li>
            <li> - just went back to grey and using the purple shampoo - looks better</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is towel dried.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks after touching up my roots I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own bleaching of dark hair to blonde for years</li>
            <li> and I get highlights normally</li>
            <li> it tones right to a platinum color with one application, and a white/gray after a second application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may need two bottles if you have super long hair or plan on toning all of your hair.</li>
            <li> works great, be careful if used with blue can damage, but makes it white, if you want it that white.</li>
            <li> , I do see that it says in the description \\&quot;(New</li>
            <li> the color did not process at all your best getting stuff actually at salons, at least their not watered down versions.</li>
            <li> It helped, but did NOT make it white and believe me, my hair was LIGHT and already white in some places.  </li>
            <li> I should have left it in the full hour the first time, but I fixed that with a second application and my hair is pure white now!</li>
            <li> it really looks so much nicer than raw bleached hair because it eliminates or neutralizes brassy spots and yellow spots, making the hair look more professionally done.</li>
            <li> but the green faded pretty quickly~</li>
            <li> I used this toner and my hair came out soft and natual looking!</li>
            <li> Also, I have pretty short hair, so I had plenty of the product to cover everything.</li>
            <li> It left my hair a much more platinum blonde color compared to the orangey yellow</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes, I could tell my scalp was a vivid purple (this toner is violet based).  </li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments from my professional color stylist friends, too!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> the before and after picture are taken in the exact same lighting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People everywhere are scrambling to find the last of the true &#x27;White Lady&#x27; bottles as despite Wella&#x27;s claim that it is the same formula most of us are getting less than white results since the change.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the &#x27;White Lady&#x27; title up top there makes us think it is &#x27;White Lady&#x27; (NOT an unreasonable assumption IMO)</li>
            <li> I did this twice over 14 days, but still wanted a shade I could live with as my natural color grew out, I researched online &amp; found Wella Color Charm toners, specifically T18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and easily applied so you really don&#x27;t need much to cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked it because it softened the bleached deep yellow blond to a slightly paler version version of blond.  </li>
            <li> just wish it had been the real &#x27;White Lady&#x27; as I would not have ordered it if I had been certain that it was not.</li>
            <li> , my scalp is pretty raw right now</li>
            <li> This product along with the Wella Cream Charm Liquid Clear Developer 20 Volume did the trick.  </li>
            <li> I used 1 bottle with 2 parts 20 vol clear developer and allowed to process for 15 min.</li>
            <li> like, it actually was very soft.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> so..I&#x27;m a natural medium Blond.  </li>
            <li> will be light lavender in just a few places.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in two instances so far:</li>
            <li> after bleach with 10/20vol developer (Wella Color Charm developer is my recommendation) and with 10vol developer directly on virgin hair.</li>
            <li> in mind as well that I&#x27;m not allergic to ANY hair dyes both professional or box dye kits</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tricky and the entire time you&#x27;re doing that, your scalp is probably going to be stinging and burning.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a lasting colour, this really isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I had always believed that when my naturally auburn hair turned gray, it would have the silvery look I&#x27;ve always admired on others.</li>
            <li> It did very well with evening out the overall blond color and diminished the orange blond strands.  </li>
            <li> The color of the highlighted areas improved considerably.</li>
            <li> Reviews warn you not to leave it in too long or your hair will become gray or purple, but also make sure you leave it in long enough.</li>
            <li> I am one of those brown haired girls that wants blonde hair</li>
            <li> and I wanted to completely remove any and all yellowing.</li>
            <li> so we think we&#x27;re getting the old</li>
            <li> i have dyed gray hair, and i recommend it for people who want blonde, white, or gray hair, because (after bleaching to a light banana yellow)</li>
            <li> I only needed 10 minutes, and nearly a month later, it&#x27;s still keeping my yellow areas more neutral to ashy blonde.</li>
            <li> package says wait 20 mins but watch your hair closely as it processes &amp; rinse it out as soon as you achieve desired tone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Tho my hair is still a nice pale ashy blonde color the silvery part faded out after several days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After bleaching, I usually have a brassy color to my hair (super frustrating for me) and this toner was great at lightening up the blonde.</li>
            <li> Only had to leave on for 5 minutes--I would be careful about leaving on for the full 30 as it could turn your hair purple.  </li>
            <li> When I first went from box-dyed red hair to salon-dyed platinum, my hair actually had a white/silver look to it for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> After settling for less than desirable drug store shade of Super Light Ash, I finally buckled down and went to Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and i knew that it was a good thing when it turned purple blue, but when my timer beeped and i washed my hair my already shimmer lights toned hair just turned back to its ugly lightly bleached color or did nothing at all, no lighter no whiter :</li>
            <li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t leave it on TOO long if your hair is porous or already very pale as it WILL turn your hair a funny grey color, but if that happens, a couple washes with a clarifying shampoo and you&#x27;ll be all good.</li>
            <li> Took the yellow right out disnt leave it grey or purple and my hair is not like straw.</li>
            <li> White Lady did sound odd to me.</li>
            <li> It is not &amp;#34;white lady&amp;#34;,  it  isa light ash blonde toner--a blonde shade was not what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t immediately tone after bleaching anymore as the bleaching process is already pretty rough on my hair.</li>
            <li> toner for most people should not be left on this long unless you have black hair....</li>
            <li> Originally I used Wella White Lady toner (T18) all over my entire hair for 30 minutes after bleaching my roots (BE CAREFUL:</li>
            <li> I only have to lighten the new growth (7th stage with 1 activator)</li>
            <li> I give it only 4 stars because it&#x27;s mysterious to find out how to really use this if you are not a cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li> AT LEAST one more time to get it to a yellow state.</li>
            <li> The highlighted parts of my hair were starting to turn really brassy, which looks totally trailer trash- it was driving me nuts!</li>
            <li> This color can be hard to find at Sally&#x27;s, so lucky for me, I have Amazon Prime!  </li>
            <li> I use a half bottle almost every week with a double portion of 20 volume developer to keep my blonde free of yellows or reds.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t even super dry as expected.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After about a week, the dark gray turned lighter, but it&#x27;s still very much gray.</li>
            <li> Read reviews all over the internet which highly recommended only keeping on 10 minutes, though the directions state can be left on up to 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they can&#x27;t use this toner on clients for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> From barely even working to working too well...</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to reduce the yellow/orange/copper color of my roommates blonde (she is naturally a brunette).</li>
            <li> Bleach your hair as far as it will go and this will turn it white</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair naturally that pulls heavy gold when messed with.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice to get it to a pale yellow color and then used this toner after hearing such fantastic things about it.</li>
            <li> This reduced the brassiness, but now my hair has a slight golden hue, with white/ash blonde streaks.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that i didn&#x27;t wanna further damage my hair, i had two options, wait a few days and do a quick lighten and then tone, or</li>
            <li> With that hint from other reviewers (thank you), I was able to get the blonde I had been wanting (if only for a little while, since of course it fades/washes out/whatever).</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go from my natural medium blonde to white/platinum.</li>
            <li> The other thing you can do is buy a strand of human blonde hair and test this product on it first if you have never used it.  </li>
            <li> I love the color now, and mix/use less than half of this toner (read the included proportion instructions) to cover my long hair.  </li>
            <li> read on a few sites that you NEED to use this RIGHT AFTER bleaching the final time.</li>
            <li> but yeah, it barely did anything even though I left it on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not purple and not grey.  </li>
            <li> I first went back from black to blonde</li>
            <li> As long as your hair is at least a light yellowish color</li>
            <li> While I wish the less damaging toners would work, the use of developer and chemical process of this one is what makes the toner really WORK.</li>
            <li> so the recommended 20-30 minutes wasn&#x27;t near long enough for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight black (I&#x27;m half Japanese), but I&#x27;ve had my hair pure snow</li>
            <li> Leave on longer if needed, but be aware that other reviews state hair can turn blue or silver if left on too long.  </li>
            <li> is the blue stuff, them the 40 cream, for blondes or dark blonde this will make it pure white.</li>
            <li> I was red when it wasn&#x27;t so cool to be red, or at least that was my thinking.  </li>
            <li> I usually know if the first 15 minutes of color if the person knows what they are doing because my roots should look very dark in order to first cut the red during the color process.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with the Wella Color Charm 20 Volume Developer and it tones all of the copper/brassy hues out of my bleached hair (naturally jet black) to a completely platinum, white color.</li>
            <li> I have naturally light brown hair that I have been dying dark (almost black) for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is ABSOLUTELY TRUE that you should not leave it on for as long as it instructs, unless you want a dull purple/maroon.</li>
            <li> This toner is powerful, it&#x27;ll make the mixture white, but slowly purple</li>
            <li> I find that on my freshly bleached thick curly hair I only have to leave it on for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, fast forward three months to pale yellow blonde.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this to get a natural looking blonde it WILL work, despite what other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> The parts of my hair where it was not highlighted however,  were unpleasantly, unexpectedly, and unevenly lifted a shade or two with major reddish hues.</li>
            <li> I just think the description is not clear especially when taking into consideration the giant font &#x27;White Lady&#x27; in the title.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge dramatic change</li>
            <li> \\&quot;For starters I have platnium blonde hair and my natural color is a dark brown.  </li>
            <li> My natural color is dark blonde.</li>
            <li> I had gotten it professional bleached (from a dark brown) and toned a couple times at the salon, but couldn&#x27;t quite get the yellow tone out.</li>
            <li> Even after that, the blond is still not very apparent.</li>
            <li> Left the lightest areas light, and the darker areas look like darker blonde instead of red or cheesy brass.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a yucky, mousey dark blonde/light brown.  </li>
            <li> naturally have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair while wet (used kaleidocolors in the blue pack, mixed with 20 volume toner and shampoo, left on for 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> ...starts to look grayish if left on too long.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be too yellow or too grey.</li>
            <li> I would recommend 2 applicators if you have thicker or long hair, also, a deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> it have the same purplish tone if you leave it too long?</li>
            <li> Does it turn grey for same reason?</li>
            <li> It can go extra blue-ish if you leave it on too long for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Not completely but enough that I would say it helped ALOT.  </li>
            <li> if left in too long; it may turn your hair a purple hue.</li>
            <li> after dry my hair Is white with a grayish tone to it.</li>
            <li> only complaint really is in the packaging as it is oily and by the time i got it, it was already seeping out onto the box.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I had let my hair air dry 80% of the way prior to toning because I had to run an errand before applying the toner</li>
            <li> A medium-to-dark blonde, not the platinum blonde I expected.   </li>
            <li> Also, if you have orange tints to your hair and you&#x27;re not wanting to bleach it anymore I highly recommend you get the silver lady toner because it has more of a blue base so it&#x27;ll counteract that.</li>
            <li> I gave Wella Color Charm White Lady (goes on dark violet ) give stars because it has allowed me to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at last with my white (not gray or silver) hair, which has the dullness and texture of a pile of cotton balls.</li>
            <li> i think the time as to how long to leave it on is a little vague, if someone can tell me the exact timing (or anything else that might be useful)</li>
            <li> Let me emphasize that I used this to tone down the yellow and orange, NOT to get white hair (which is what this will do if your hair is lightened enough beforehand).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to go blonde in the past and this has been the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually made my blonde look semi-natural vs. yellow</li>
            <li> Follow the directions with this product because it can and it WILL turn your hair grey or possibly some other funky color like purple or blue if you do not follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> If you want platnum hair, you need to bleach to a very pale yellow, NOT bright gold, it has to be light yellow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so extensive, I will need to pay a professional a small fortune to go through my hair and separate the sections that needed to be correctively colored.</li>
            <li> Even though White Lady is applied with developer, my dark blonde hair requires additional stripping.</li>
            <li> I underestimated how long I would need to leave it on</li>
            <li> , and even after that, I washed my hair and it ended up turning my hair grey.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long, yes, it will turn your hair purple or gray.</li>
            <li> Before I  my  hair it was a orangey pink color because my hair was previously red .</li>
            <li> I tried purple shampoo and it helped but only minimally.</li>
            <li> Clairol use to make this but discontinued a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Tougher to properly use than expected</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on too long if you already have bleached highlights in your hair because they will turn a purplish grey.</li>
            <li> The only way to go platinum without brassiness, be careful though to not leave it on too long or your hair will turn waaaaayyyyy to silvery.</li>
            <li> Works well, but very difficult to get hair to that White Lady color we know and love.</li>
            <li> This was not a pure white toner.</li>
            <li> mixed half of each toner with level 20 developer and left it in my hair for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product did the trick, I have virgin Asian black hair and using this toner helped lift the yellow tints in my hair.</li>
            <li> Due to all the hype that i heard about this toner turning peoples hair white (the colour that i wanted my hair to be), after doing lots of research finding this toner, how to mix and how long to leave it on</li>
            <li> will give it a second chance with the spare that i bought but other than that</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product other than that it only lasts a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> or it will turn grey or purple!</li>
            <li> That had NEVER happened the last time I used it nor with any other toner or hair color.</li>
            <li> It also fades over time and it will bring a little bit of yellow back.</li>
            <li> The other plus side is that the toner last quite a bit.</li>
            <li> it on dry hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;put</li>
            <li> The instructions say shampoo it out, so I did, conditioned and blotted dry.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks later I bleached my roots again this time I used Ivory Lady (Wella T10) on my roots and on the rest of my hair and my roots were not light enough</li>
            <li> I used the highly recommended T18 Lightest Ash Blonde or once known as &amp;#34;White Lady.&amp;#34; I had naturally dark hair and bleached it up to the pale yellow (inside of a banana) stage over the course of a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gained a few blonde strands.</li>
            <li> I now realize that my hair was too dark to tone properly.</li>
            <li> I have medium blonde hair that I lightened myself from dark brown.</li>
            <li> I could only handle 5 minutes with it on, which is only because my skin was already raw and sore.</li>
            <li> I used this toner to tone down the yellow tinge to my hair.</li>
            <li> left it on a little long and there are some like purple hues</li>
            <li> Only worked on half of my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use on dry hair or wet hair</li>
            <li> use Wella White Lady toner with a 20 or 30 volume developer every week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have bra-strap length hair and only needed half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I would still recommend putting it on for less time and reapplying if necessary.</li>
            <li> Then, the next day your scalp will also feel as tight as a rubberband.</li>
            <li> The first day it produces a very faint tinge of purple which dissapears quickly and is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> The results are always a little different, from silver to gray to . . .</li>
            <li> i should have used 40 volume bleach because my hair is hard to lift and left the bleach on for max time for the same reason) and my hair had purple tones.</li>
            <li> The resulting color is lavender gray, but at least the roots (so far) aren&#x27;t yellow/white.</li>
            <li> it on wet hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I left this on for a few minutes then rinsed it out, conditioned, slathered on coconut oil.</li>
            <li> However I am a firm believer that all hair is different.</li>
            <li> Now after using dish soap and a few washes my hair is white....</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly never bleach your hair 2 days in a row, i did it once, then the next day, then waited a few days and did it again,</li>
            <li> One minute can make a difference, so monitor your hair carefully.    </li>
            <li> and then tone all of my hair with Wella T-18 a few days later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light/medium brunette who has heavily foiled blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> With that said after thousands of dollars spent in</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, my hair was not light yellow</li>
            <li> My hair became harder and tangly.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t leave it on too long, as it will turn your hair grey, which will wash out after a few shampoos.  </li>
            <li> use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings the color from yellow down to white everytime - I&#x27;m addicted and as long as I have white hair - Wella will be the product that keeps it that way!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;After I bleach my hair, I color it with a neutral base (my fave&#x27;s are 9N or 10N), then tone it with this for a really nice looking pale blonde Or...</li>
            <li> I can think of* that this isn&#x27;t working for people is because their hair a) isn&#x27;t lightened to a pale yellow and/or b)</li>
            <li> well, my hair was not the pale yellow shade it should have been, so it was on my head longer than that.</li>
            <li> Hair was entirely pale yellow before using.</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to already be at a pale yellow.</li>
            <li> has to be pale yellow for it to work.</li>
            <li> I am pale to begin with but have a bit of sun from the summer and the color it was made me look like I had an extremely red / overly tan face.</li>
            <li> I now use 10 volume, or less, to achieve the same results with less damage.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be the cure for the stubborn subtle yellow left to my platinum hair.  </li>
            <li> When I go blonde, I want to be white blonde, not an ugly yellow blonde.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and and spiky, but a few notches down from punk.</li>
            <li> so it cut my time in half) and my hair did not turn green, blue, ashy or otherwise freaky.</li>
            <li> Left on for 15 minutes and voile - no more brassy tones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s being used with something other than a 20 volume peroxide.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this again in a few weeks after it starts to fade!</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected too!</li>
            <li> Back then, parents didn&#x27;t usually allow hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> I simply wet it down in the sink and towel</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my salt &amp; pepper hair dark blonde but hated the resulting shade, so I lifted the blonde via a \\&quot;soap cap\\&quot; of equal parts 20 vol peroxide &amp; clear gloss.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair to remove red colorants, but still had some very pale (</li>
            <li> Sadly, this color just doesn&#x27;t last long enough to continue spending the money on it.  </li>
            <li> have dark blonde hair, but my hair is not very good at processing.</li>
            <li> I have lightest blond ash and some dark lights and highlights.</li>
            <li> If it looks as if it&#x27;s turning dark, WASH IT OUT.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is completely bleached out and quite porous it does take on some violet tint if I leave it on for too long, but this fades in a wash or two (and I secretly don&#x27;t mind it for a few days)!</li>
            <li> I would carefully check it every few minutes as the box suggest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly it was a let down....</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the awful brassiness and produces a lovely ashy/white blonde color.  </li>
            <li> However, I had some purple where the toner got on hair that was previously bleached...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I need an all over application once every month and a half to two months.</li>
            <li> But that also is because I&#x27;m not super fond of living life in hair masks</li>
            <li> Will that go away in less than a week?</li>
            <li> Hard to determine how long to leave on hair</li>
            <li> I naturally have a dirty blonde hair color which tends to look like dirty dish water and always dirty, but I used this toner and it made my hair a gorgeous pale ash color.</li>
            <li> problem is, my scalp was burned so badly that three weeks later, I still can&#x27;t stand the pain of washing my hair because I have giant red burns all over my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started doing it myself since I usually have to explain to them how hard it is to cut red.  </li>
            <li> Also, because peroxide is a strong base, I sprayed my damp hair with Braggs apple cider vinegar to restore the PH.</li>
            <li> , I had windows opened as I froze my little buttocks off...</li>
            <li> , if you leave this toner on your hair will turn a little purple.  </li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m keeping it for a little bit.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still in your hair, it does look a little bit purple but that fades as soon as you wash it out.</li>
            <li> This product was a little harsh on my hair, but I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and bleach it with a powder toner + liquid developer.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t look bad whatsoever - a hairdresser actually complimented me on the &amp;#34;gorgeous color&amp;#34; and asked me if it was natural.</li>
            <li> But it will go away in a few days.  </li>
            <li> ;, so i just did what the youtube vids did and put it on damp/towel dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> However, it washed out after a few showers (even with toning shampoo), so I had to reapply it.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turned my hair purple and green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been green and purple a lot.  </li>
            <li> dried it before applying the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> may need to re-tone your hair after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have porus hair definitely consider using coconut oil on your hair before all bleaching, leaving it in at the LEAST 2 hours before processing, it will seriously help.</li>
            <li> , it looks terrible on me, and does not in any way match the cool blonde</li>
            <li> BUT I also have very thick, long hair, so I probably should have used two</li>
            <li> My hair was dry from the bleach, but the toner didn&#x27;t make it any worse at all.</li>
            <li> It smelled really badly (like all hair coloring products) but it also didn&#x27;t really tone my hair.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my hair usually refuses to let go of the brass</li>
            <li> After my roots, I usually put it on the freshly-bleached part with a brush (hair damp), leave it on for maybe 5 minutes, and then extend to the ends and rinse promptly.</li>
            <li> My hair was quite yellow after a color-stripping process that went quite wrong.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stores whenever it is on sale and stock up.  </li>
            <li> Checking is difficult because you can&#x27;t wipe away enough purple to see what it is doing -hence</li>
            <li> Hair originally mixed with dark blonde/light brown base, with all over highlights that were getting rooty.</li>
            <li> From the very first MOMENT it touched my scalp, it was awful.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it has yellow streaks and looks like a bad bleach job..</li>
            <li> Got rid of the ugly yellow and gave me platinum.  </li>
            <li> , I ended up with some really dry scalp with that awful tightening feeling too the following day.</li>
            <li> mixed my toner with 20 volume base and it slowly turned purple in the bowl before I applied it to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> but then hate the brassy washed out look 3-5 weeks later.</li>
            <li> depending on the base, I can go totally ash/</li>
            <li> I seriously need to start buying this stuff in bulk!</li>
            <li> i dont think ill be buying this product again in the future, ill just have to depend on my purple shampoo conditioner and or silver dyes....  :(</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with 20 Vol developer though that would be my recommendation if you have a lot of brass.</li>
            <li> so be wary (as always), but the 1st time I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;However my hair holds onto yellow/golds like crazy</li>
            <li> It turned what what I would call a \\&quot;dirty blonde\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Wash it out in cold water.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes, 10-20 level developer, condition like crazy, mask any residual odor with coconut oil, and go forth to conquer your world.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this toner!</li>
            <li> Ill stick with manic panic!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product because the example the sales girl showed me was just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Use with caution and don&#x27;t go crazy!</li>
            <li> The base of the toner is violet.</li>
            <li> I hate that color</li>
            <li> Smells terrible though.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

            <li> Works well. Works best if you can wrap your hair in tinfoil. Smells terrible though.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this was not the toner color I needed.....but the green faded pretty quickly~</li>
            <li> All brassy haired ladies take note- this is the best toner EVER!! I used volume 10 (products says to use 20 but I only had 10- so it cut my time in half) and my hair did not turn green, blue, ashy or otherwise freaky. I have been coloring my hair since the days of Sun-In, and have made SEVERAL trips to the stylist sheepishly holding my tail between my legs and dropping at minimum 150$ to fix the damage- I really do know what I&#x27;m talking about!!! This product is perfect for us folks that like to go blonde but then hate the brassy washed out look 3-5 weeks later. It saved me a trip and money and I did it all while my 6 month old was nappin&#x27;- win win! Get this. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Purchased the Wella T11 and T18 with a 20 volume developer to tone the brassiness in my blonde, colored hair.  Mixed it up and distributed through my hair.  Left on for 15 minutes and voile - no more brassy tones.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked perfectly to remove the brassy tones from my blonde hair</li>
            <li> This toner did it&#x27;s job but my goodness, this smelled so strong, I had windows opened as I froze my little buttocks off... it was freeeezing outside. Lol. I am not sure of the exact amount of minutes I left it on but it was definitely under the recommend 30 minutes. I think I should&#x27;ve kept the bleach on my hair longer ( I used Quick Blue ) But it all worked out and I&#x27;m satisfied. My hair wasn&#x27;t even super dry as expected. I&#x27;d probably buy again but the smell is a bit strong for me, so please keep your bathroom or wherever you&#x27;re doing your hair well - ventilated!</li>
            <li> Only worked on half of my hair. Didn&#x27;t take out the orange like everyone says it does.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair and it was yellow with orange undertones!!! I used this toner and my hair came out soft and natual looking! IT works perfect and it didnt destroy my hair , i mixed it with a  20 vol. and left it on about 10 mins. I love this product and will stick with it !</li>
            <li> Really takes out the brassy colors and leaves my hair a beautiful platinum.</li>
            <li> Turned banana yellow into champagne in 10 minutes. Would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair it made it a really pretty sunny blonde color :) I liked it!</li>
            <li> It gets out the yellow yes but it won&#x27;t turn it white if u want white hair go for the silver wells charm toner the t17 I think it is..that&#x27;s what im doing and I shall post how it went later lol after I bleach the color out of it the lightest I can get it without breaking off THAN toning it with a silver toner ten minutes like the last time and or maybe in between dyes and bleaches mix the toner with conditioner and if u really want to spice it up mix the toner with ur bleach! That always pumped up the toning process foe me but every hair types different</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go from my natural medium blonde to white/platinum. I bleached my hair twice to get it to a pale yellow color and then used this toner after hearing such fantastic things about it. I underestimated how long I would need to leave it on so I ended up having to use the whole bottle, but really unless your hair is super duper long, you should be able to get 2 uses from each package of this. It&#x27;s thin and easily applied so you really don&#x27;t need much to cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However my hair holds onto yellow/golds like crazy so the recommended 20-30 minutes wasn&#x27;t near long enough for me. I should have left it in the full hour the first time, but I fixed that with a second application and my hair is pure white now! So this stuff is seriously good and can really pack a punch on brass. Like I said, my hair usually refuses to let go of the brass so that&#x27;s some high praise from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very gentle. My hair was dry from the bleach, but the toner didn&#x27;t make it any worse at all. People who claim to have gotten damage obviously didn&#x27;t use a low enough developer. Nothing over a 20 volume should EVER be used with a toner. You aren&#x27;t lifting your hair with this, you&#x27;re neutralizing another shade so you really only should be using a 10 volume.</li>
            <li> I have white hair - and this is the only toner I use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings the color from yellow down to white everytime - I&#x27;m addicted and as long as I have white hair - Wella will be the product that keeps it that way!</li>
            <li> this is just what i need to get my hair to that ashy blonde/white I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve, plus the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color I got using this mixed with T11 toner and a 20 developer on my pre-lightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, my scalp was burned so badly that three weeks later, I still can&#x27;t stand the pain of washing my hair because I have giant red burns all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was the developer, but I&#x27;ve had more than one hairdresser tell me that it&#x27;s the toner, not the developer.  Apparently they can&#x27;t use this toner on clients for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so bummed, because I really like the color I got.</li>
            <li> Amazing results and arrived here super fast!</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday after making a skunk stream. This works great for getting rid of the residual yellow you can never get out after a straight bleach. It will look blue but it will successfully take out all the yellow and make it took white/grey.</li>
            <li> okay - had to use purple shampoo and conditioner to get the last of the yellow out.  - just went back to grey and using the purple shampoo - looks better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this toner! The only reason *I can think of* that this isn&#x27;t working for people is because their hair a) isn&#x27;t lightened to a pale yellow and/or b) it&#x27;s being used with something other than a 20 volume peroxide. It isn&#x27;t going to lighten hair, just TONE it.   Also, if you have orange tints to your hair and you&#x27;re not wanting to bleach it anymore I highly recommend you get the silver lady toner because it has more of a blue base so it&#x27;ll counteract that. This is purple and will only work it&#x27;s magic on the yellow. (:</li>
            <li> \\&quot;For starters I have platnium blonde hair and my natural color is a dark brown.  I bleached my roots, rinsed, shampood with a purple shampoo, regular shampoo, then conditioner. My ends were white and roots were blonde. I applied this to my roots first then immediately on my ends. Total time on roots 4 minutes, ends 2-3 minutes. And my hair turned lilac/grey white. I washed out with regular shampoo then conditioned. after dry my hair Is white with a grayish tone to it. This stuff is POWERFUL.  I used 10vol developer. 1part toner, 2 parts developer.  Didnt leave my hair straw like, it actually was very soft.\\&quot;  **UPDATE**  After washing my hair twice (with purple shampoo) most of the toner washed out. My hair is still light but not  grey/white</li>
            <li> so..I&#x27;m a natural medium Blond.  I wanted to be blonder so I used a box color kit.  big MISTAKE My hair literally turned orange/apricot.  The only way to get that light blond look with a drugstore hair color is to use a toner like this.  This product worked well but you have to use it as directed.  This is where it gets tricky and here is my advise to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give you some advise from my trial an error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1.  Make sure your hair is towel dried.  DO NOT use on dry hair or wet hair&lt;br /&gt;#2  Make sure you are mixing this entire bottle with 20 V (volume) developer.  don&#x27;t use 10 or 30 but 20.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what brand, sally brand is fine.&lt;br /&gt;#3.  This bottle is 1.4 oz so you have to use 2.8 oz of developer.  That&#x27;s tricky to measure if you are using an applicator bottle.  just BE Careful and make sure you are doing the 1:2 ratio.  (note:  I screwed this up and used 1.4 oz of toner to 3.5 oz of developer and still got good results but maybe I would have had better results)&lt;br /&gt;#4.  It says to leave on 30 minutes.  I could see my hair turning blue after 15 minutes so I rinsed it then.  That is all my hair needed just 15 minutes.  .  Pay attention to your hair during this time so you don&#x27;t get violet/purple hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product.  I give it only 4 stars because it&#x27;s mysterious to find out how to really use this if you are not a cosmetologist.  It took me much online research and looking at youtube videos.  I have to say my hair turned out great.  It used to be $300 to color my hair.  Now I can do it for the price of this toner and developer.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to take away brassiness out of hair and whitened my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It worked well but you HAVE TO REMBER TO GET THE DEVELOPER! It needs it to work</li>
            <li> It was &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; according some salon attendant but I claimed BULLFLY!&lt;br /&gt;So I went online and BAAm here it is. To be honest this is the best for people looking to have white/platinum blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to throw it on my head but have seen it do wonders.</li>
            <li> As long as your hair is at least a light yellowish color it really gets the bright white I was looking to achieve</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair a strawberry blonde color over my blonde hair a month ago (wella brand tahitian red blonde). It was a really pretty color at first, but it faded fast and turned into this ugly brassy orangey color. I bleached my hair while wet (used kaleidocolors in the blue pack, mixed with 20 volume toner and shampoo, left on for 10 minutes). It lightened but was still brassy. I applied this toner with 20 volume toner and left it on for 20 minutes and I love the color it gave me! Its no longer brassy at all. I&#x27;m really happy!!</li>
            <li> I hear a lot of positive things said about this product, but my own hair must be too porous because after a bleaching, I can only leave this on my hair maybe 5 minutes before everything literally turns purple.  If I left it on for the directed amount of time, I&#x27;d have a full head of purple hair (that looks mostly gray).  I&#x27;ll have to find another toner that works a little better for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a blonding saga resulting in orangey brassy hair that just would not quit. Taking to the internet, I found this legendary product with raving reviews and decided to go for it - I have only used box dye drugstore products up until this point, so I was hoping for a true miracle. After purchasing, I found out I probably should have gotten a different shade since my hair was more orange than yellow, but I had already invested so much into this (paying for one day shipping) and I was running out of time, so I went for it anyway. It says not to leave it on for more than 30 minutes...well, my hair was not the pale yellow shade it should have been, so it was on my head longer than that. It turned deep purple in the bowl, but not on my head. The yellow parts of my hair got more neutral and the orange parts toned down a lot, but my hair is still very warm overall. However, it doesn&#x27;t look bad whatsoever - a hairdresser actually complimented me on the &amp;#34;gorgeous color&amp;#34; and asked me if it was natural. Imagine my shock at that ha. I think if I had gotten silver rather than white my hair wouldve looked even better, but I am still pleased with the turn out. The only issue with this was my own mistake - I was in a race to get this because of an event I was going to so I didn&#x27;t look around more first before purchasing. This seller charges more than others for some reason so I definitely overpaid on top of the one day shipping charge. The packaging was kinda jacked up but the product was fine. Do your research before purchasing - this applies to everything though :)</li>
            <li> Okay product but white lady does not make your hair fully white</li>
            <li> I used because I had read a recommendation on another forum from a licensed cosmetologist  who said it was the best to get platinum blond look. My hair ended up darker than before  i used it. It turned what what I would call a \\&quot;dirty blonde\\&quot;. Do not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is the purple one, I have used about 4x.  I used it everytime I do my roots.  When I lived in Florida I went to a fantastic lady who made my hair platinum.  Moving to Michigan I have yet to find anyone who can do that, they all messed it up and made it orange and I wanted to cry!&lt;br /&gt;So I had to learn how myself.  With lots of research I have been for almost a year now.  I bleach first with a 30 volume developer. Then I use this toner along with a 20 volume developer.  you mix this with the developer and leave on for 15-30 min and bam your hair has no yellow! Now it does not work miracles.  If you want platnum hair, you need to bleach to a very pale yellow, NOT bright gold, it has to be light yellow. then use this.&lt;br /&gt;(After using this I also use Wella T14.  Wella T14 is a gray toner that gets orange tones out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if you leave this toner on your hair will turn a little purple.  But it will go away in a few days.  If you dont want that then only leave on for like 15 min. I leave mine on for 30 and mine will be light lavender in just a few places.  the places where is it purple is where it is most white.</li>
            <li> after bleaching my hair to the palest yellow and re-bleaching the part that i missed or turned orange i decided it was time to use this toner.  Due to all the hype that i heard about this toner turning peoples hair white (the colour that i wanted my hair to be), after doing lots of research finding this toner, how to mix and how long to leave it on I had high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it was a let down....I know that i mixed it correctly (20 vol, 1:2 ratio) and i knew that it was a good thing when it turned purple blue, but when my timer beeped and i washed my hair my already shimmer lights toned hair just turned back to its ugly lightly bleached color or did nothing at all, no lighter no whiter :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if i should have left it on longer or what, cause lots of different people on different sites said different times not to mention some said &amp;#34;put it on dry hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;put it on wet hair&amp;#34;, so i just did what the youtube vids did and put it on damp/towel dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even though i followed the instructions to a T i think the time as to how long to leave it on is a little vague, if someone can tell me the exact timing (or anything else that might be useful) then i might get good results ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a second chance with the spare that i bought but other than that i dont think ill be buying this product again in the future, ill just have to depend on my purple shampoo conditioner and or silver dyes....  :(</li>
            <li> I got this product because I heard good things about it  . LETS JUST SAY MY OPINION IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT ! It turned my hair purple. Never again . I&#x27;m not looking forward for people seeing my hair like this .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner with a mix of T050 (1-2 cap fulls of the latter)for about six months. The results are always a little different, from silver to gray to . . . purple. For some reason that I don&#x27;t understand, my roots have decided that they don&#x27;t like this toner. Tonight I bleached, shampooed it out, combed my hair and applied the toner from the back of my head forward. The instructions say shampoo it out, so I did, conditioned and blotted dry. I was a lovely silver color except for my roots, which remained light yellow (as in inside of banana peel). As I looked through my hair I found more and more yellow roots. I reapplied the toner with a 10 volume developer and dabbed on some T050 drabber. I left this on for a few minutes then rinsed it out, conditioned, slathered on coconut oil. The resulting color is lavender gray, but at least the roots (so far) aren&#x27;t yellow/white. Weird. My natural color, by the way, is salt and pepper on top and steel gray in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once before I used this toner and it turned my hair violet. Just don&#x27;t know quite what to make of it.</li>
            <li> It turned the first couple inches of my roots a nice color, but beyond that, it left sections of my hair yellowy and turned the bottoms darkish gray. Hair was entirely pale yellow before using. Also, I have pretty short hair, so I had plenty of the product to cover everything. Definitely regret buying. ):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After about a week, the dark gray turned lighter, but it&#x27;s still very much gray.</li>
            <li> Works well after bleaching hair, gives hair platinum blonde look.  Hard to determine how long to leave on hair...starts to look grayish if left on too long.</li>
            <li> I bought this to tone my hair after I bleached it, and it made it an almost white/silvery color. However, it washed out after a few showers (even with toning shampoo), so I had to reapply it. The second time I left the color in a bit longer than I planned, and when I washed it out my hair was silvery grey, it was very beautiful. I have no complaints about this product other than that it only lasts a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my salt &amp; pepper hair dark blonde but hated the resulting shade, so I lifted the blonde via a \\&quot;soap cap\\&quot; of equal parts 20 vol peroxide &amp; clear gloss. I did this twice over 14 days, but still wanted a shade I could live with as my natural color grew out, I researched online &amp; found Wella Color Charm toners, specifically T18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T18 was formerly known as White Lady but is now called Lightest Ash Blonde, still has same T18 number.  Following package directions I mixed 1 part toner to 2 parts 20 volume peroxide, painted it on my blonde hair &amp; waited 15 mins.  The results were fantastic--a silvery beigey color very complementary for my skin &amp; eye color--no more brassy blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package says wait 20 mins but watch your hair closely as it processes &amp; rinse it out as soon as you achieve desired tone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Tho my hair is still a nice pale ashy blonde color the silvery part faded out after several days.  I&#x27;m still tickled w/ the remaining ash blonde.</li>
            <li> I use this toner on already highlighted hair with 20 volume oxidant and this is the result I get. I love it! The only thing is it&#x27;s a bit damaging for the hair so you may want to use 10 volume instead if your hair is damaged. But remember to always use it on already bleached/highlighted hair and keep it from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the results you want to get</li>
            <li> Wella makes the best, easiest to use hair toners.  This color can be hard to find at Sally&#x27;s, so lucky for me, I have Amazon Prime!  Boom!  There it is!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for platinum blonde hair you&#x27;re going to need White Lady toner. It&#x27;s a violet toner that counteracts the yellow tones in your hair. If you have orange tones, you&#x27;re going to need a blue toner such as Silver Lady. Sometimes you need both. I know I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed half of each toner with level 20 developer and left it in my hair for 10 minutes. Wash it out in cold water. Happy, healthy platinum hair!</li>
            <li> Just same of  the pic</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to get white hair like myself, this isn&#x27;t the stuff for you. I&#x27;d suggest buying a tub of purple dye, and then mixing it with conditioner and dying your hair a light purple and just letting it fade. The results are better.</li>
            <li> What a waste. Ill stick with manic panic! However I am a firm believer that all hair is different. Boo.</li>
            <li> When I go blonde, I want to be white blonde, not an ugly yellow blonde.  My natural hair color is a yucky, mousey dark blonde/light brown.  This stuff works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Wella White Lady toner with a 20 or 30 volume developer every week and a half to two weeks.  It gets rid of the awful brassiness and produces a lovely ashy/white blonde color.  If you have short hair (like I do) you can probably get two uses out of one bottle.  I use about 1/8 cup of toner with 1/4 cup of the developer.  Works like a \\&quot;charm\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also:  I recommend not shampooing after you tone.  You will wash most of it away.  Rinse with warm or cold water after toning for best results.  I also avoid washing it more than a couple times a week to really extend it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people everywhere on the internet insist on recommending this toner to achieve white hair. What i got using it was silver gray hair! I did and used everything that was specified to do and still no white! I do not call silver/gray hair white hair. What are people, colorblind? Wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> love it! THE best for toning out yellow shades.</li>
            <li> Lightened my hair and took away most orange brassy tones very satisfied :)))</li>
            <li> If you want to make your hair white, THIS IS IT. Bleaching your hair alone wont do that, if you use this toner once every 6 months along with bleaching, your hair will lighten up quick!</li>
            <li> The only way to go platinum without brassiness, be careful though to not leave it on too long or your hair will turn waaaaayyyyy to silvery.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner but do NOT leave it on your hair too long or it will turn grey or purple!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! First time I used this toner, and for exactly the results I was looking for. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Not a wisp of brassy hair in sight.</li>
            <li> I normally have light brown hair that does not lift easy died blonde over 15 years. Originally I used Wella White Lady toner (T18) all over my entire hair for 30 minutes after bleaching my roots (BE CAREFUL: toner for most people should not be left on this long unless you have black hair....this was my first time and I used the box instructions when I should have left it on 10 minutes MAX). While this DID change my roots to a nice platinum color it turned the rest of my long hair a silverly tone because it was already a light blonde. When this happened I used 3 parts lemon juice and 1 part conditioner on my hair to fix it...I also used a clarifying treatment from Sally&#x27;s and my hair was a nice color. 4 weeks later I bleached my roots again this time I used Ivory Lady (Wella T10) on my roots and on the rest of my hair and my roots were not light enough (I think this was my fault....i should have used 40 volume bleach because my hair is hard to lift and left the bleach on for max time for the same reason) and my hair had purple tones. I was able to get the purple tones out with another clarifying treatment (from Sally&#x27;s) along with dandruff shampoo and I like the end color better than the T18 toner BUT my roots were still too brassy. This time when I did my roots I bleached them and put the toner (White lady, T18) on my roots only (as recommended from Sally&#x27;s) but for 10 minutes and it turned out white. However, I had some purple where the toner got on hair that was previously bleached...dish soap removed the purple. (PS: I should note that I have been using Prism Lites Violet bleach because this is what I had but I feel like I would have gotten better results if I had used Quick Blue which I will use next time. Now after using dish soap and a few washes my hair is white....maybe too white. Next time I will use Wella T10 (Ivory Lady toner) after I bleach for less than 10 minutes and do my best to NOT touch hair already bleached.</li>
            <li> I have lightest blond ash and some dark lights and highlights. I use a half bottle almost every week with a double portion of 20 volume developer to keep my blonde free of yellows or reds. I rub it in like shampoo, leave it on for 15 minutes, rinse, wash and condition. The first day it produces a very faint tinge of purple which dissapears quickly and is hardly noticeable. After that, it just brightens and also reduces all traces of brassiness in every shade of highlight. But I notice that after 7 days, the yellows start to creep back and require a refresher.</li>
            <li> you have to bleach your hair to be as white as you can get it before using this. if it&#x27;s still too brassy it won&#x27;t do anything. but after bleaching my hair to as light as i could i used this and it made it look so amazing. a perfect frosty blonde..  like a winter princess :D</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair naturally that pulls heavy gold when messed with. I&#x27;ve used this in two instances so far: after bleach with 10/20vol developer (Wella Color Charm developer is my recommendation) and with 10vol developer directly on virgin hair. I am very impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I need an all over application once every month and a half to two months. Also, that I prefer using the 10vol developer over the 20vol developer when following bleaching. I don&#x27;t immediately tone after bleaching anymore as the bleaching process is already pretty rough on my hair. But that also is because I&#x27;m not super fond of living life in hair masks often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first went back from black to blonde I had quite a bit of orange. For orange hair, I suggest T14 toner. The T14 toner did not look very good on my virgin hair that was bleached (lemon yellow level/white level) however, so a mix or doing each part separately is advised.</li>
            <li> as any toner is, its smells really strong but this one was able to help strip the color from my hair to make it white in no time.</li>
            <li> I used the highly recommended T18 Lightest Ash Blonde or once known as &amp;#34;White Lady.&amp;#34; I had naturally dark hair and bleached it up to the pale yellow (inside of a banana) stage over the course of a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this toner, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it. I was a level 8 and from the very first impression of it, I didn&#x27;t like it. It smelled really badly (like all hair coloring products) but it also didn&#x27;t really tone my hair. It was a pretty light blonde then but yeah, it barely did anything even though I left it on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fast forward three months to pale yellow blonde. I was really looking forward to trying this toner again since I wanted to give it another chance. It comes so highly suggested! So I did my new growth and brought my hair up one more shade and waited until the next day to tone all over. OH HOLY GOD IT BURNED! It was literally a stinging, burning sensation! From the very first MOMENT it touched my scalp, it was awful. That had NEVER happened the last time I used it nor with any other toner or hair color. It was awful. It was to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even imagine letting it sit on my head for more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind as well that I&#x27;m not allergic to ANY hair dyes both professional or box dye kits but yeah, it burned for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and this time as well, I ended up with some really dry scalp with that awful tightening feeling too the following day. It sucked.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, and even after that, I washed my hair and it ended up turning my hair grey. From barely even working to working too well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the toner does work but you really have to get the timing of it down perfectly or else you&#x27;ll be too yellow or too grey. It&#x27;s really tricky and the entire time you&#x27;re doing that, your scalp is probably going to be stinging and burning. Then, the next day your scalp will also feel as tight as a rubberband. It&#x27;ll suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off with just getting a haircolor as a toner.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone wanting to dye their hair lighter;use this product because it works.  With that said make sure you know how to use this product before using it.  Otherwise your results might not meet your satisfaction.  Great toner.</li>
            <li> Great price came fast</li>
            <li> This product did the trick, I have virgin Asian black hair and using this toner helped lift the yellow tints in my hair. One advice is that if you have any ORANGE, in your hair, it is best to use the T14. If you bought this instead, I recommend bleaching your hair AT LEAST one more time to get it to a yellow state. This toner is powerful, it&#x27;ll make the mixture white, but slowly purple so it is best to put it in your hair as quickly as possible so the color on your head doesn&#x27;t become uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, will be buying this again soon for my roots!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I used the whole bottle and left it on for about 20 minutes, and it didn&#x27;t do much to my hair. The second time, I left it on for around 30-40 minutes and some strands of hair turned purple/gray, but it went away after a couple washes. This product was a little harsh on my hair, but I would use it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight black (I&#x27;m half Japanese), but I&#x27;ve had my hair pure snow white multiple times now. I&#x27;ve tried just about every toner out there to find the best, and this is by far my favorite. While I wish the less damaging toners would work, the use of developer and chemical process of this one is what makes the toner really WORK. Personally, I prefer leaving the toner on until my hair is lavender and within a wash or two my hair is white. It seems that going to lavender first and letting it fade out gets your hair to a better white, while going straight to the color you want will simply cause it to fade a bit more yellow when it settles.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one. It you are looking to go platinum, this is a great tonar, but be very careful you don&#x27;t leave it on long, as it can turn your hair purple or gray. After my roots, I usually put it on the freshly-bleached part with a brush (hair damp), leave it on for maybe 5 minutes, and then extend to the ends and rinse promptly. Will leave my hair a gorgeous white.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  I do not go a day without someone complimenting this gorgeous platinum hair color.</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair many many times from black/brown only to find that I have orange, yellow sometimes even pinkish tones in parts of my hair. This toner is the only thing that has taken care of that. If you leave it on too long, yes, it will turn your hair purple or gray. The base of the toner is violet. Duh! I find that on my freshly bleached thick curly hair I only have to leave it on for 5-10 minutes. It leaves my hair a beautiful platinum ash color. Also, if your hair is super orange, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you. Your hair needs to already be at a pale yellow. My best advice is, better safe than sorry. If it looks as if it&#x27;s turning dark, WASH IT OUT.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It&#x27;s easy to use and for the first few days it leaves my hair a gorgeous pastel lavender colour. It fades quickly to my normal platinum blonde, but I sure enjoy the purple tint while it lasts.</li>
            <li> ive used this a bunch of times and always love the results. Even when my hair is a darker blonde with brassy tones it makes it perfect. It does dry it out though so get some good deep conditioner</li>
            <li> It tones your hair perfectly. Since toners are semi-permanent, they do fade off rather quickly. So if you&#x27;re looking for a lasting colour, this really isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I gave Wella Color Charm White Lady (goes on dark violet ) give stars because it has allowed me to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at last with my white (not gray or silver) hair, which has the dullness and texture of a pile of cotton balls. I had always believed that when my naturally auburn hair turned gray, it would have the silvery look I&#x27;ve always admired on others. Not so. It took plenty of experimentation and a lot of research before I realized that what my hair lacked was a violet tint. Otherwise it has yellow streaks and looks like a bad bleach job.. With this toner, my hair is sexy platinum, not the old gray mare. I wear my hair short and and spiky, but a few notches down from punk. It is shiny and platinum.....not purple BTW....and I feel years younger. I wish I&#x27;d discovered this product ten years ago</li>
            <li> Im note sure if i just didn&#x27;t put enough product but i followed the measurements that were instructed but the hair still looked brassy. I toned blonde hair but this product did&#x27;t really do this job for the look that i was going for.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the creme but it is only the toner you mix with the creme. I already had the toner. Cannot return it. Now, I have enough toner to last me 7 years and still no creme developer. That will teach me to stop shopping from my phone and trusting the title and picture!</li>
            <li> I have highlights all over, which were getting brassy and yellow. Decided to try this on my own. Hair originally mixed with dark blonde/light brown base, with all over highlights that were getting rooty. Test strip proved uneventful at 30 min, so processed whole head according to the box directions for 40 minutes almost. Lifted my brown hair to a lighter shade, took out all yellow. It&#x27;s altogether a bit darker than it was, but looks less rooty, which is good. A bit ashier than I wanted, but I am guessing some of that will brighten up over shampoos.</li>
            <li> Worked just like I hoped it would! I bleached my hair to the lightest i could get it without burning it off. It was sooooo yellow! I searched the web after my hair girl kept telling me to use the toning shampoo and I wasn&#x27;t getting the results i wanted. I found many blogs writing about this product so i tried it. Used volume 10 developer bc thats what I had and left it on for 15 mins and I&#x27;m soooo happy withthe end results! Took the yellow right out disnt leave it grey or purple and my hair is not like straw. I will definitely use this again in a few weeks after it starts to fade!</li>
            <li> Only had to leave on for 5 minutes--I would be careful about leaving on for the full 30 as it could turn your hair purple.  Came sooner than expected too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one star because it came as ordered, on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my hair purple and green. Which is install, But I did not look  like the super hot girls on Instagram. I looked more like a Pinterest Fail. Luckily, I already washed most of it out and I will be just fine soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, consult a stylist before you use these toners to fine out what reaction your hair might have. I do not doubt this is a good product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Best cure for brassy color ever! Left the lightest areas light, and the darker areas look like darker blonde instead of red or cheesy brass. Beautiful, delicate color. Yum.</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works, and I don&#x27;t know why people are so horrified over purple/grey tinted hair when you should be horrified by orange and neon yellow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on a few sites that you NEED to use this RIGHT AFTER bleaching the final time. Your hair needs to have some prior processing time with a chemical coloring or a dip in the pool in order to work. I almost waited overnight to give my scalp a rest and it was almost a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark blonde hair, but my hair is not very good at processing. If you have porus hair definitely consider using coconut oil on your hair before all bleaching, leaving it in at the LEAST 2 hours before processing, it will seriously help. If you don&#x27;t believe me, look it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly never bleach your hair 2 days in a row, i did it once, then the next day, then waited a few days and did it again, and then a final time the next day, my scalp is pretty raw right now and it&#x27;s pretty burned. Despite the fact that i didn&#x27;t wanna further damage my hair, i had two options, wait a few days and do a quick lighten and then tone, or just hope it doenst burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i did the hoping and with assistance from my husband i got it on my hair. I could only handle 5 minutes with it on, which is only because my skin was already raw and sore. I know that if i use it again in a month when i do my roots, it&#x27;ll be different. It DOES burn if you have some sensitivity. I have dealt with chemical burn before so I&#x27;m not unfamiliar with my limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five minutes my hair was a beautiful white ash platinum. I started with very neon yellow hair after 4 blonding treatments with two different products (Kaleidocolor Blue and Wella Lightest Ash Blond 12/81 back and forth, the Kaleidocolor worked much better and was better scented) But the Wella toner was amazing. Now i just need to get some aloe vera on my scalp and wear a hat for a couple days to block my hair from the sun. This was all worth the pain because my hair is beautiful now.worth the pain because my hair is beautiful now.</li>
            <li> Heaven in a bottle! Took most of the brassy orange from my bleached hair. I would recommend 2 applicators if you have thicker or long hair, also, a deep conditioner!!! Overall great product, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Had a lot of yellow and orange in my hair after I bleached it. Looked for toners and came across this. Had great reviews already, so not brainer. Got it fast as I asked for two day shipping. My hair came out great! Had a little more orange than I liked but when it dryed it all came out this ashy blonde. So beautiful. I was going to dye my hair ombre purple and blue.but now I&#x27;m keeping it for a little bit. I like it that much.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner out there! I have used this product for years and it is amazing for banishing orange brassy tones and removing slightly yellow tones. Perfect for those who wish to reach a very pale white blonde color. Follow the directions with this product because it can and it WILL turn your hair grey or possibly some other funky color like purple or blue if you do not follow the instructions. You can use with 10 or 20 vol developer. You can never go wrong with 20 Vol developer though that would be my recommendation if you have a lot of brass. And please do know the difference between &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; color and ORANGE! This product will not remove orange hair, if your hair is still orange after bleaching it then it did not lift enough and you need to re-bleach the hair to lift the orange out and then tone. If you simply put the toner over orange hair you will not be satisfied with your hair guaranteed and it is of NO fault to the product, but simply your own fault.</li>
            <li> Did not eliminate most yellow tones. Had better results just using Shimmering Lights Shampoo under a showercap for 40 minutes and in ratio that is much more cost-effective (and compartively, more effective in general).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is ABSOLUTELY TRUE that you should not leave it on for as long as it instructs, unless you want a dull purple/maroon. With that hint from other reviewers (thank you), I was able to get the blonde I had been wanting (if only for a little while, since of course it fades/washes out/whatever). I haven&#x27;t met a toner that didn&#x27;t fade, so I&#x27;m not holding it against it.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your platinum choice- this&#x27;ll help!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!! I bleached the ends of my hair using the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al blue packet and the Wella 20v developer. Afterwards, I used this mixed with the same Wella developer and left it in for about 20 minutes. While it&#x27;s still in your hair, it does look a little bit purple but that fades as soon as you wash it out. It left my hair a much more platinum blonde color compared to the orangey yellow it was before.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, it toned down all the brassiness!</li>
            <li> I used this product with a 20 volume developer by wells and it worked AWESOME I will ALWAYS buy this to tone my hair. Before I  my  hair it was a orangey pink color because my hair was previously red . I love this and you will too</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply recommended this toner to reduce the yellow/brassiness in my hair.  Read reviews all over the internet which highly recommended only keeping on 10 minutes, though the directions state can be left on up to 30 minutes.  After 10 minutes, I could tell my scalp was a vivid purple (this toner is violet based).  Made me nervous, so I rinsed out at 10 minutes.  I think if I had left on another 5-10 minutes, the color would&#x27;ve been more platinum.  This reduced the brassiness, but now my hair has a slight golden hue, with white/ash blonde streaks.  A medium-to-dark blonde, not the platinum blonde I expected.   Not hideous, I almost love it, but not quite the color I was expecting.    I would recommend a strand test, or rubbing a spot of toner off around 10 minutes to see what color you&#x27;ve achieived.  Leave on longer if needed, but be aware that other reviews state hair can turn blue or silver if left on too long.  One minute can make a difference, so monitor your hair carefully.    Be sure to put on in a well ventilated room, the smell is strong!</li>
            <li> toned my bleached hair to a nice ashy color in 15 minutes, though it left my hair dry. make sure to use 10 or 20 volume developer only.&lt;br /&gt;photos are before and after</li>
            <li> Works best if you can get your hair to a pure yellow, if not, you&#x27;ll end up an ashy brown/dirty blonde as opposed to silvery.</li>
            <li> This color was perfect for what I was needing. My hair was quite yellow after a color-stripping process that went quite wrong. this color deposited the right amount of grey-blue tones to make my hair the perfect blonde that I needed in only one application. I used the Wella 20 developer with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use as instructed.</li>
            <li> Updated on 8/2/15:  I&#x27;ve been using this toner now for almost a year and am changing it from 4 stars to 5 stars!  You can see my hair color if you click on my profile photo.  I continued to experiment with achieving the platinum soft silvery pale blond and finally found the right combination for my hair, which is very fine and prone to breaking when using strong chemicals.  Using this toner, or any other chemical is &amp;#34;double processing&amp;#34; and will stress/damage hair more each time.  Once I achieved the color I wanted, I found that I no longer need to use 20 volume developer.  I now use 10 volume, or less, to achieve the same results with less damage.  Yay!!  I love the color now, and mix/use less than half of this toner (read the included proportion instructions) to cover my long hair.  I only have to lighten the new growth (7th stage with 1 activator) and then tone all of my hair with Wella T-18 a few days later.  The color lasts longer now since using 10% developer because it actually deposits color, not lighten.  I get a lot of compliments from my professional color stylist friends, too!  I really am happy with the product!  I usually buy it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stores whenever it is on sale and stock up.  Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s door-to-door delivery service though, so I buy it here, too.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because it softened the bleached deep yellow blond to a slightly paler version version of blond.  Made my natural silver roots more white though, which I wasn&#x27;t looking for at this time.  I&#x27;m actually trying to &amp;#34;go silver&amp;#34; to blend in the gray/silver/blond better.  It did very well with evening out the overall blond color and diminished the orange blond strands.  I&#x27;ll update this review within a year and adjust the rating, if appropriate.  Pretty good results, but hope it continues to improve my color over time.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the ugly yellow and gave me platinum.  Love it.  Fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li> Wella&#x27;s T-18 knocks that right out and can be used right after bleaching for white/platinum hair.(MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR IS THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE if using right after bleaching- works better:)&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that in stores the color changed a bit and is not enough \\&quot;ash\\&quot; - If you&#x27;ve seen the blue/silver box, you know what I&#x27;m talking about...:/&lt;br /&gt;But this is the original T-18-- And it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Does it have the same purplish tone if you leave it too long? Yes. Does it turn grey for same reason? Yes. Will that go away in less than a week? Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;After I bleach my hair, I color it with a neutral base (my fave&#x27;s are 9N or 10N), then tone it with this for a really nice looking pale blonde Or...depending on the base, I can go totally ash/white!&lt;br /&gt;Because this is so versatile, it has quickly become a staple in my *ahem* VERY LARGE hair product collection. I would recommend this to anyone-- Just make sure you know what kind of blonde you want to be. T-14 is better if you want a lesser effect (normal blonde) and T-10 is better if you want more of a beige toned blonde. But as for me--The lighter, the better!&lt;br /&gt;Probably shouldn&#x27;t have dyed my eyebrows though...*Looks in mirror... Runs in bathroom for med blonde tube:P*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light/medium brunette who has heavily foiled blonde highlights. The highlighted parts of my hair were starting to turn really brassy, which looks totally trailer trash- it was driving me nuts! So much so that I didn&#x27;t want to wait weeks for an appointment at my stylists. I bought this hesitantly because I was worried about the damage that using 20 volume developer would do to my already bleached strands. I read the reviews and followed the instructions, watching my hair to make sure it didn&#x27;t go to purple. After 15 minutes, it looked appropriately toned, and I rinsed and deep conditioned it. The color of the highlighted areas improved considerably. Had a nice, natural medium blonde shade. The parts of my hair where it was not highlighted however,  were unpleasantly, unexpectedly, and unevenly lifted a shade or two with major reddish hues. OMG! I tried to keep the toner off my scalp, but the parts of hair where I had my hair piled on my head got the toner solution on it, and the unbleached sections were all turned reddish brown. I hate that color, it looks terrible on me, and does not in any way match the cool blonde&lt;br /&gt;highlights! The reaction from my family members was: &amp;#34; oh, it&#x27;s not THAT bad&amp;#34;! It&#x27;s so extensive, I will need to pay a professional a small fortune to go through my hair and separate the sections that needed to be correctively colored. I should have stuck with a deposit only toner gloss- that washes away, but does not lighten your hair like 20 volume developer does. I guess 20 volume developer is actually 20 volume peroxide- it will lighten your hair. In my case, to a horrid shade of auburn. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> This is a great toner. Just be careful you don&#x27;t leave it on TOO long if your hair is porous or already very pale as it WILL turn your hair a funny grey color, but if that happens, a couple washes with a clarifying shampoo and you&#x27;ll be all good. :) For the price, this toner is really great and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toners. This one definitely gives you a silvery shade of blonde.</li>
            <li> It toned a bit of the brassy red tint out of my hair, which I was delighted with, but it wasn&#x27;t a drastic change. I now realize that my hair was too dark to tone properly. Using this product again on freshly lightened hair worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be the cure for the stubborn subtle yellow left to my platinum hair.  It helped, but did NOT make it white and believe me, my hair was LIGHT and already white in some places.  I had better luck with Virgin Snow.</li>
            <li> I love White Lady by Wella as it gives my hair a soft white color, very platinum looking.  However, don&#x27;t leave it on too long, as it will turn your hair grey, which will wash out after a few shampoos.  I leave it on for about 10 minutes and my color lasts three to four weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wella White Lady for several years. My natural color is dark blonde. Even though White Lady is applied with developer, my dark blonde hair requires additional stripping. I have always used the Wella Wellite Creme Lightener with oil for the first step. Next day I apply White Lady. It is exactly the color I want and looks best on me.  Wella has redesigned the liquid toner boxes and changed the name of White Lady. It still has product number T18 but the box shows \\&quot;lightest ash blonde.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this toner. After searching around for a bit and reading tons of reviews, I decided to try White Lady. I will say that applying the stuff was nerve-wracking because of the purple color. I ended up leaving it on for just about 17 minutes and that was perfect for achieving a nice silver blonde color. My hair was very light yellow(bleached) to begin with and I think this is key. This will not strip your color, but will only deposit to counteract brassiness (and do an amazing job at that!). I did not personally notice any damage from using this toner, but it does have a strong chemical smell. I seriously need to start buying this stuff in bulk! Love.</li>
            <li> Used it for the 2nd time yesterday and def. left it on a little long and there are some like purple hues so be wary (as always), but the 1st time I didn&#x27;t and it worked great for getting my hair super white blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint really is in the packaging as it is oily and by the time i got it, it was already seeping out onto the box.</li>
            <li> oK,  if anyone knows hair trouble I feel strongly I qualify!  I am a natural red head.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and have been getting my hair colored since I was 20.  I was red when it wasn&#x27;t so cool to be red, or at least that was my thinking.  Back then, parents didn&#x27;t usually allow hair coloring.  Any I&#x27;d be rich if I had a $1.00 for every time I heard and still hear, oh you have red hair why would you want to color it!  Please, I grew up with it and although I am lucky and tan easily I still was self-conscious to be different.  Anyway, after going to salons I realized I was different and it was not automatic even for the color pros to have a clue how to cut red!!  I&#x27;ve been green and purple a lot.  I usually know if the first 15 minutes of color if the person knows what they are doing because my roots should look very dark in order to first cut the red during the color process.  If its light they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.  With that said after thousands of dollars spent in salon&#x27;s I leave with an ok with my hair.  Not a Wow!  I started doing it myself since I usually have to explain to them how hard it is to cut red.  Now I am blonde and I love t18 after and in between color.  It will freak you out during the process so beware.  I don&#x27;t know how many times I panic&#x27;d and rinse prematurely even though I knew better.  It will turn literally a deep purple on your head.  It is supposed to and is a good thing.  Checking is difficult because you can&#x27;t wipe away enough purple to see what it is doing -hence a test is your best reassurance, as big of a pain as it is.  I end up at the pale yellow stage, then apply the T18 and its a beautiful white/blonde. Not purple and not grey.  (I am lucky to have no grey and hear I&#x27;ll go white first but who knows.</li>
            <li> I have naturally light brown hair that I have been dying dark (almost black) for a long time. I recently decided to put in highlights and make my bangs blonde. I used 20 volume bleach and had to bleach my bangs 3 times. I still was left with some orangey spots and the color overall was very yellow and bright. I tried purple shampoo and it helped but only minimally. A few weeks after touching up my roots I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and decided to try this. I was scared it would damage my hair or that it wouldn&#x27;t work because I kept reading your hair has to be pale yellow for it to work. Let me tell you, my hair was not light yellow and the results were still awesome! Let me emphasize that I used this to tone down the yellow and orange, NOT to get white hair (which is what this will do if your hair is lightened enough beforehand). I left it in for just over 15 minutes and my bangs are a uniform ash blonde color. I should haved left in in longer because I wish it was lightened a bit more but I am so pleased. If you want to use this to get a natural looking blonde it WILL work, despite what other reviews have said. Your hair does have to be pretty light though. And to my surprise this didn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair at all. Reviews warn you not to leave it in too long or your hair will become gray or purple, but also make sure you leave it in long enough. 20 minutes should be good if your hair isn&#x27;t that light to begin with.</li>
            <li> it hurts if youve  just done some hvy duty bleaching, but sooo worth it the color it produced &#x3D; beautiful white color, but not natural, somewhat surreal</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I naturally have a dirty blonde hair color which tends to look like dirty dish water and always dirty, but I used this toner and it made my hair a gorgeous pale ash color. Even my brother, who is less than observant most of the time, noticed and complimented it. Only tips I have are to watch the color closely and do not rinse when it looks steely gray, wait 5 more minutes</li>
            <li> Works well, but very difficult to get hair to that White Lady color we know and love. Two bottles would really get the job done better than one. It&#x27;s imperative you don&#x27;t overwash and that you use purple shampoo and/or conditioner each time you do wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a trusted brand and a reliable product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work with orange/ginger hair. I only gained a few blonde strands. After rinsing the solution out, I&#x27;ve noticed a big increase in straw-like feel. It felt more dead than ever, more dead than bleaching it. My hair became harder and tangly. About 2 centimeters of my tips actually turned blond. Even after that, the blond is still not very apparent. And I feel that the orange parts actually turned MORE orangey. But, I felt like it was my fault and I think I added too much developer (Wella 20 v developer). Service was great though!</li>
            <li> Turned my light yellow hair a more natural hue.  I bleached my hair to remove red colorants, but still had some very pale (level 9 or so) orange and yellow.  This toner is very strong, so do be careful to monitor it, especially if you have very light or porus hair. It can go extra blue-ish if you leave it on too long for your hair.  I only needed 10 minutes, and nearly a month later, it&#x27;s still keeping my yellow areas more neutral to ashy blonde.</li>
            <li> great for toning the yellow blonde to ash, can&#x27;t stand the golden/brassy tones!</li>
            <li> the color did not process at all your best getting stuff actually at salons, at least their not watered down versions.</li>
            <li> Not like it, did not lightened my hair even when it was light orangy color ready bleached, my hair just ended up damaged thats the only thing i got from this product</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seems to be the only one on the market to give you true Marilyn Monroe platinum blonde.  Be sure that you bring your hair to a very very light blonde first and test strand to see how long to leave it on.  Most people on YouTube say 10 minutes but I found that I needed 25 minutes.  Wella makes great products but seems to be the only one who makes a true platinum blonde product.  What a shame.  Clairol use to make this but discontinued a long time ago.  The other thing you can do is buy a strand of human blonde hair and test this product on it first if you have never used it.  I recommend that you also watch the many YouTube videos on this product to be sure that you understand what to do.  This product used to be called White Lady However if you buy at Sally&#x27;s they will only know it as T18.  This seller got me the product pretty fast and I would recommend buying from him again if you don&#x27;t have a Sally&#x27;s close by. Otherwise if you can, buy at Sally&#x27;s and you wont have shipping fees.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good, turned hair close to white</li>
            <li> This toner works amazing. I bleached my hair and still had some yellow to it and I used Wella White Lady and it instantly took all the yellow, brassiness out of my hair. It will kind of make it look gray for the first couple days but subsides. It also fades over time and it will bring a little bit of yellow back. If you are wanting to stay bleached and you keep up on it, eventually you will not need to use this toner because you will be white already :) the only other time I think that this toner will be needed is if you have troubles with your roots when touching them up.</li>
            <li> It is not &amp;#34;white lady&amp;#34;,  it  isa light ash blonde toner--a blonde shade was not what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair it turned out really brassy.  I read the reviews and thought I would try it.  So glad I did.  The color is absolutely beautiful now.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  I have been doing my own bleaching of dark hair to blonde for years but no matter what I used I could never get the yellow out.  Well now I have!  This product along with the Wella Cream Charm Liquid Clear Developer 20 Volume did the trick.  My hair is now the platinum blonde shade I have always wanted.  It is so soft in color and texture and soooo sophisticated looking that you would swear that it was professionally done, but at a most reasonable price.  Thanks for the reviews from everyone, you helped me find my true self.</li>
            <li> Once I had bleached my hair to a light banana yellow (from a dark brown), I used this to pull the rest of the yellow/brass out and it worked beautifully. Easy to use; follow the instructions on the box. Easy Peasy!</li>
            <li> I have medium blonde hair that I lightened myself from dark brown. This worked pretty well to get rid of the orange tint. I took off a star because it made my hair even more dry than before, but I did leave this on there for a good 30-40 min to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toner I have used to get the platinum blonde shade I have always wanted.  Nothing gets the brassiness out of my hair quite like this product.  I highly recommend, and don&#x27;t forget a level 20 developer if you are toning bleached hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, I can&#x27;t highlight my hair without it. I am one of those brown haired girls that wants blonde hair and I used to always get orange results, now I use clairol highlighting bleach kit and then I tone it afterwards with this for 30 minutes and just like magic I have beautiful blonde hair - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Tougher to properly use than expected</li>
            <li> works great, be careful if used with blue can damage, but makes it white, if you want it that white. i loved it. for dark hair blue is the best with this.bleach. is the blue stuff, them the 40 cream, for blondes or dark blonde this will make it pure white. bring back the 50&#x27;s. a huge 10</li>
            <li> I love this toner. I had my hair professionally bleached to a very very light blonde. It was beautifully done but still a bit alarmingly yellow to me. I am pale to begin with but have a bit of sun from the summer and the color it was made me look like I had an extremely red / overly tan face. Not pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the T18 toner to my hair with a 20 volume developer also by wella and let it sit for almost exactly 9 minutes. I do want to note that I did this on un-shampooed hair. Moreover, I had let my hair air dry 80% of the way prior to toning because I had to run an errand before applying the toner and before I left the house I did put a bit of morrocanoil on my hair so I could comb it through before going out. When I got home and got ready to tone I simply wet it down in the sink and towel dried it before applying the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I think I could have left it on a bit longer to get a bit more white - I think I&#x27;ll try 12 minutes next time - but what I have now is a wonderful ash blonde that I am so happy with. Also another note, I did not apply this to freshly bleached hair. If you do, it seems to me that, logically, your hair would be more porous after bleaching so you might not need to leave it on as long. Just play it safe the first time. And I&#x27;m definitely not a pro so research and make sure you&#x27;re safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the before and after picture are taken in the exact same lighting. It&#x27;s not the best lighting but at least it is consistent! This color is exactly what I wanted. So happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
            <li> My hair was unevenly yellow after bleaching. I had bands of yellow at the roots, and the layer underneath was both darker and yellow. This product was exactly what I needed to get my color even all over. I used 20vol developer and started where the hair was darkest and most yellow, left it in for about seven minutes, then pulled it through to the whiter areas for about five minutes. Voila, silvery blonde all over. It doesn&#x27;t lift, so the layer under was still a touch darker, but it made it much much more even. It&#x27;s also economical. I have bra-strap length hair and only needed half the bottle. It IS damaging though, so I did a protein treatment the day before and a deep conditioner afterward. Also, because peroxide is a strong base, I sprayed my damp hair with Braggs apple cider vinegar to restore the PH.</li>
            <li> I used this toner to tone down the yellow tinge to my hair. I had gotten it professional bleached (from a dark brown) and toned a couple times at the salon, but couldn&#x27;t quite get the yellow tone out. I&#x27;ve tried to go blonde in the past and this has been the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually made my blonde look semi-natural vs. yellow yellow yellow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it while my hair was damp and left it on for ~6 minutes after reading the scarier reviews of getting purple hair! I wish I would have left it on longer! I think about 10 minutes would have been even better, and I plan on re-doing it soon. I would still recommend putting it on for less time and reapplying if necessary. My hair is now a lovely shade of ashy, but still slightly golden blonde (think Taylor Swift) that I really like. It&#x27;s a natural color and doesn&#x27;t clash with my dark eyebrows like the yellow-blonde did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - great product. Use with caution and don&#x27;t go crazy!</li>
            <li> This works well for taking out that gross banana color you get after bleaching. I didn&#x27;t see a huge dramatic change BUT I also have very thick, long hair, so I probably should have used two, also my hair was lightened to a sort of sunny orange color and not all the way to a light blonde, so that was probably a factor as well. My roots though were lighter than the rest of my hair (since my hair was dyed before bleaching and my roots had grown out) and it turned the roots a reeeally nice silvery blonde color. So I think if you bleach your hair up to that light yellow color, it will bring out the yellow brassiness and turn your hair into a nice, gentle ash blonde.</li>
            <li> I mixed this into hair color and it did Keep brass out. Not completely but enough that I would say it helped ALOT.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  This product is renamed Lightest Ash Blonde.  White Lady did sound odd to me.</li>
            <li> Used it with Color Charm 20 volume creme developer - turned out beautiful but was very drying and I have oily hair.</li>
            <li> Took my orangey-yellow bleached hair to an almost platinum blonde!  Miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Toned out all the orange in my hair and left my hair a gorgeous platinum blonde. Would definitely recommend, I love it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it MANY times. I have very dark hair and bleach it with a powder toner + liquid developer. After that process, my hair is the color of an apricot, especially the roots. White Lady fixes orange tone. Yay!</li>
            <li> my hair absorbed the purple, didnt like it.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that this arrive expired, As I have bought it from sally&#x27;s and had zero problems with it. Luckily I bought two and one of them happened to actually work.</li>
            <li> The BEST toner out there. I mix it with the Wella Color Charm 20 Volume Developer and it tones all of the copper/brassy hues out of my bleached hair (naturally jet black) to a completely platinum, white color. Since my hair is completely bleached out and quite porous it does take on some violet tint if I leave it on for too long, but this fades in a wash or two (and I secretly don&#x27;t mind it for a few days)!</li>
            <li> The product worked as stated and great value for the price. Would buy again if need! Made thing a lot easier!</li>
            <li> The color that arrived was lightest ash blonde. This was not a pure white toner. It worked well, but only took my hair to light ash.</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have brownish blonde hair and I get highlights normally but after using some semi permanent box colors my hair had that brassy orange look on the top. The ends were still blonde from the highlights. I used the T18 color for 15 minutes with the developer and my hair looked great again. No brassy orange and a lighter blonde all over. I will definately use it again.</li>
            <li> Tried for quite some time to get my already super blond hair white. After settling for less than desirable drug store shade of Super Light Ash, I finally buckled down and went to Sally&#x27;s. I was very skeptical of this product because the example the sales girl showed me was just not what I was looking for. My hair was already as light I as I could get it with bleach and I wanted to completely remove any and all yellowing. I used 1 bottle with 2 parts 20 vol clear developer and allowed to process for 15 min. When applying and while developing this product turned my hair very very lavender. Honestly I was worried that if I left this product on my hair too long that it would stay lavender. After rinsing, my hair looked ash. When it dried it was perfect. I love it and will absolutely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how well this worked, I wouldn&#x27;t have felt I need to fry my hair with bleach to get the color I wanted. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first went from box-dyed red hair to salon-dyed platinum, my hair actually had a white/silver look to it for a week or so.  Then it faded out to platinum and I got pretty depressed! I ordered this Color Charm and the Color Charm 20 Volume cream.  After a thorough application, I went right back to that white/silver (arctic fox looking) color that I loved! Sadly, this color just doesn&#x27;t last long enough to continue spending the money on it.  I even used some purple shampoo to keep brassy/yellow tones at bay, but within about 2.5 weeks, I was no longer white.  I just wish that the results lasted a bit longer, because having that silvery white hair was amazing!</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Never fails to deliver.</li>
            <li> if u are looking for a platinum blond toner, this is the best thing, it works perfectly for me I love love the result.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to reduce the yellow/orange/copper color of my roommates blonde (she is naturally a brunette). It worked perfectly! Changed yellow-blonde to white/ash-blonde in one treatment. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i was looking forward to achieving platinum blonde hair. the directions on the box say to leave on hair for up to 30 minutes. after about 3 minutes, my hair had turned PURPLE. i immediately washed it out. had to use another blonde box dye which thank goodness worked to get rid of the purple (except for the tips of my hair).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t white lady, but the quality and brand were still there.</li>
            <li> The product I received is not &#x27;White Lady&#x27; but the newer formulation now called &#x27;Light Ash Blond.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I do see that it says in the description \\&quot;(New Name: Lightest Ash Blonde)\\&quot; but the title still says &#x27;White Lady&#x27; and I feel as if it is being left that way intentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People everywhere are scrambling to find the last of the true &#x27;White Lady&#x27; bottles as despite Wella&#x27;s claim that it is the same formula most of us are getting less than white results since the change.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the &#x27;White Lady&#x27; title up top there makes us think it is &#x27;White Lady&#x27; (NOT an unreasonable assumption IMO) so we think we&#x27;re getting the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to make sure people know it is not, this is &#x27;Light Ash Blond.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine product, the shipping was extremely fast, and the price is good so great sellers.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it had been the real &#x27;White Lady&#x27; as I would not have ordered it if I had been certain that it was not. I just think the description is not clear especially when taking into consideration the giant font &#x27;White Lady&#x27; in the title.</li>
            <li> This product helps greatly to take out any yellow/orange in your hair. I would carefully check it every few minutes as the box suggest. (It turns purple; don&#x27;t freak out its suppose to do that). FYI if left in too long; it may turn your hair a purple hue.</li>
            <li> Only color that makes my yellow turn platinum. I need to stock up. Saves my hair color mistakes every time!</li>
            <li> but possibly will be 5 once i figure out the right processing time for my hair. I am bleaching my hair for the first time and after the glowing reviews of this product, i had to buy it and try it out. Don&#x27;t leave it on too long if you already have bleached highlights in your hair because they will turn a purplish grey. It definitely takes the orange/brass out pretty good though. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have light blonde hair and when I have my roots touched up, they are sometimes brassy. Wella Color Charm T18 is just what I need to tone them to get my hair white blonde.</li>
            <li> This product worked great to get rid of the brassy color in my hair and prep it for coloring my hair silver/gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally have dark brown hair and I have to use 40 volume bleach on my hair for about 45-50 min to get a blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After bleaching, I usually have a brassy color to my hair (super frustrating for me) and this toner was great at lightening up the blonde. Make sure you use purple shampoo when you wash your hair to keep the brassy colors away and help maintain the white blonde look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need to re-tone your hair after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed my toner with 20 volume base and it slowly turned purple in the bowl before I applied it to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I would definitely order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need two bottles if you have super long hair or plan on toning all of your hair. I have a peek a boo style and just needed the toner for the upper 1/2 of my hair.</li>
            <li> This has always been my holy grail toner :)</li>
            <li> Amazing pure white toner. Bleach your hair as far as it will go and this will turn it white</li>
            <li> Looooove T18! I used it after taking my hair from a level 10 to a level 1 at my roots and 2 at my ends (my ends were stubborn) it got rid of my yellow to the perfect shade of cool platinum blonde, couldn&#x27;t be happier! I followed the directions from the back of the box using the Wella Volume 20 Developer and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. The product didn&#x27;t damage my hair or turn it purple at all. The other plus side is that the toner last quite a bit. So happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> Excellent color!!!! you won&#x27;t regret to try it, just don&#x27;t forget to add a care treatment to your hair, it will need it.</li>
            <li> i really like this toner! i have dyed gray hair, and i recommend it for people who want blonde, white, or gray hair, because (after bleaching to a light banana yellow) it tones right to a platinum color with one application, and a white/gray after a second application. it really looks so much nicer than raw bleached hair because it eliminates or neutralizes brassy spots and yellow spots, making the hair look more professionally done.</li>
            <li> It toned to Ash blonde like it was supposed to so that I could get the white I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now pastel mint (which is what I was trying to achieve by using a sonic green diluted hair dye) and it&#x27;s marvelous!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for redheads who want to be blonds. 20 minutes, 10-20 level developer, condition like crazy, mask any residual odor with coconut oil, and go forth to conquer your world.</li>
