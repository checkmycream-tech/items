            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>when I used a good silicone-based primer underneath it, this concealer settles into the lines around my eyes, calling attention to my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank You Amazing Cosmetics</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is good concealer, with good coverage and a very creamy consitency.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and thus bought the lightest shade which works fine on my light to medium undereye area.</li>
            <li>Being the makeup junkie that I am, I decided to try the Amazing Cosmetics Concealer since I had heard such great things about it, but I don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>] concealer, which I love since it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>It blended incredibly well, brightened up my eyes just enough to make me look refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It blends in easily.</li>
            <li>Works best to cover dark circles/shadows under eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous concealer.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s the most gentle) to stipple the product around my eyes and scars.</li>
            <li>It might be a great product for some people, but if you&#x27;re acne-prone, be careful!</li>
            <li>stays put, smooth finish and great coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li>The only one I have found that gives me nice coverage.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, but didn&#x27;t cover completely.</li>
            <li>I seriously couldnt believe how great this was.</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty much all day if applied correctly and if used with waterproof setting powder.</li>
            <li>MY favorite concealer, this color is a tad on the cool with pink tones and even though my skin is yellow tone this color works ofr the half moon dark area to brighten, I use a powder concealer on top and it works great</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>This is more durable than your average undereye concealer.</li>
            <li>This concealer is better than the average, but still no miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best way to apply this concealer is to squeeze  a pinhead, sometimes less, amount on the back of my hand (warms the product which helps it spread evenly) and use my ring finger (has the least strength</li>
            <li>This has great coverage and has the right amount of liquid verse base.</li>
            <li>, This is super duper pigmented and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I recommend the same brand&#x27;s setting powder---all other waterproof powders I tried aren&#x27;t really waterproof and don&#x27;t set this properly, and it ends up rubbing or wearing off if your eyes water.</li>
            <li>It takes a small amount - very small - and is incredibly effective.  </li>

            <li> I have dark circles and always have a hard time finding something that has good coverage but not super thick and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also extremely tacky and hard to blend, which means that I end up tugging on the delicate skin under my eyes when I use this -- which can lead to more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, sticky and extremely pigmented so you only need a tiny, TINY amount to cover your blemishes.</li>
            <li> I thought this is a pricey little guy, but a tiny Dan does the trick!</li>
            <li> If you are younger, this may work well for you, but for us gals with a few lines on our faces, I would recommend the NeoStrata Exuviance concealer instead.</li>

            <li> Too pricey, too thick, and it gave me cystic acne wherever I used it.</li>

            <li> Works best to cover dark circles/shadows under eyes.  Works with or without powder to set.  Easy to apply.  Check it out.</li>
            <li> This is more durable than your average undereye concealer. Lasts pretty much all day if applied correctly and if used with waterproof setting powder. I recommend the same brand&#x27;s setting powder---all other waterproof powders I tried aren&#x27;t really waterproof and don&#x27;t set this properly, and it ends up rubbing or wearing off if your eyes water. Otherwise this is good concealer, with good coverage and a very creamy consitency. And non-irritating to eyes, even with contacts.</li>
            <li> This concealer is truly incredible.  I was going through a phase of under eye puffiness and darkness.  This concealer is the best brand you will find.  It takes a small amount - very small - and is incredibly effective.  Yes, I&#x27;m a guy. I used this for a week in client meetings. No one knew I was wearing this. It blended incredibly well, brightened up my eyes just enough to make me look refreshed.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> stays put, smooth finish and great coverage without being heavy. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This concealer is better than the average, but still no miracle worker. It comes in a very small tube for the price in my opinion, but a little does go a long way. I have fair skin and thus bought the lightest shade which works fine on my light to medium undereye area. It is probably the best concealer I have ever had.

            <li> Too pricey, too thick, and it gave me cystic acne wherever I used it. It might be a great product for some people, but if you&#x27;re acne-prone, be careful!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and always have a hard time finding something that has good coverage but not super thick and dry. This has great coverage and has the right amount of liquid verse base. Highly recommend trying</li>
            <li> A cover up that actually covers, yet so ligt it is virtually undetectable. It blends in easily. When I first saw the small tube I thought this is a pricey little guy, but a tiny Dan does the trick!</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, but didn&#x27;t cover completely.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer ever for under my eyes.The only one I have found that gives me nice coverage.</li>
            <li> One of the best concealer a on the market...light,totally opaque and undetectable!</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0001ZA4CS NeoStrata Exuviance CoverBlend Multi Function Concealer SPF15 - Sand, .5 fl oz]] concealer, which I love since it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 42).  Being the makeup junkie that I am, I decided to try the Amazing Cosmetics Concealer since I had heard such great things about it, but I don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I used a good silicone-based primer underneath it, this concealer settles into the lines around my eyes, calling attention to my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also extremely tacky and hard to blend, which means that I end up tugging on the delicate skin under my eyes when I use this -- which can lead to more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought this at Sephora, I will try returning it. If you are younger, this may work well for you, but for us gals with a few lines on our faces, I would recommend the NeoStrata Exuviance concealer instead.</li>
            <li> THE BEST CONCEALER IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. The product itself looks like a sample size, but can last you forever since the tiniest smidge of it is all you need for incredible coverage that lasts all day. I seriously couldnt believe how great this was. Sold.</li>
            <li> Fabulous concealer. It&#x27;s thick, sticky and extremely pigmented so you only need a tiny, TINY amount to cover your blemishes. I&#x27;ve found the best way to apply this concealer is to squeeze  a pinhead, sometimes less, amount on the back of my hand (warms the product which helps it spread evenly) and use my ring finger (has the least strength so it&#x27;s the most gentle) to stipple the product around my eyes and scars. I will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> MY favorite concealer, this color is a tad on the cool with pink tones and even though my skin is yellow tone this color works ofr the half moon dark area to brighten, I use a powder concealer on top and it works great, This is super duper pigmented and a little goes a long way this little tube lasts me about 1 year.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast service</li>
            <li> The occasional breakouts  haven&#x27;t been resolved but covering them has.  Thank You Amazing Cosmetics</li>
