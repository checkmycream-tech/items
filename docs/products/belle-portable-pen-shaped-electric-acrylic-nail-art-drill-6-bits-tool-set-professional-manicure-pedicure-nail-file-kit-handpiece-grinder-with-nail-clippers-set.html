            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Love the prices.</li>
            <li>Cheap Cheap Cheap!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to switch bits, just push the button and unscrew the top, replace bit, and tighten it again.</li>
            <li>Love how easy is to use.</li>
            <li>But for the money, it does a super job!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no tips on using each of the bits.&lt;br /&gt;The description makes it seem like the adjustable speed control would be smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s fantastic</li>

            <li>The different size and style bits are great.</li>
            <li>The plug-in power source provides more power than batteries would to run the drill at higher speeds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The translation of the manual from whatever language this was originally made in into English is not the greatest, and it&#x27;s strange that the user manual comes in your email and not in the box with the unit.</li>
            <li>This little gem works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great little machine.</li>
            <li>nothing was right about it ..</li>
            <li>thanks though, great little product for the price.</li>
            <li>The bits included are ok, but I would have preferred a few more to include something to buff &amp; shine nails as well as shape them.</li>
            <li>It gets hot if use to long.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Have tried some others...and they all left me wanting more power.</li>

            <li>It would help if I had read ;)</li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful and could do some damage if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>really does speed up the time of filing and shaping.</li>
            <li>It has the ability to go much faster than what you need to shape your nails.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>Cool little attachments came with it and the cord plugs in just fine.</li>
            <li>Nothing was broken and ever thing was intact, very light weight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Turns off in the middle of using it, even before it gets hot.</li>
            <li>but I wish it had at lease one bit with a sharp end that can clean out from under the finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca</li>
            <li>I have natural nails, and it used to take me up to 20 minutes to file everything and shape it.</li>
            <li>I can do it in 10, and get my cuticles now like never before (*tip - do not use metal bits on the surface of a natural nail -</li>
            <li>And saves you from spending a lot on frequent battery changes.</li>
            <li>ABD NATURAL NAILS</li>
            <li>This nail drill is a little on the cheap side, hence the low price.</li>
            <li>However being lazy and quick to hit the buy button, I didn&#x27;t realize it is an overseas plug.</li>
            <li>this item for the job does a very we&#x27;ll job of filing my nails down.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s working excellent as is says</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Love the color.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of selections for bits.&lt;br /&gt;It really does speed up the time of filing and shaping. I have natural nails, and it used to take me up to 20 minutes to file everything and shape it. I can do it in 10, and get my cuticles now like never before (*tip - do not use metal bits on the surface of a natural nail - it leaves some scratches instead of buffing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Exchanging the bits is a bit tough to master.&lt;br /&gt;The translation of the manual from whatever language this was originally made in into English is not the greatest, and it&#x27;s strange that the user manual comes in your email and not in the box with the unit. There&#x27;s also no tips on using each of the bits.&lt;br /&gt;The description makes it seem like the adjustable speed control would be smooth (see pic with the dial speed control). Mine goes from slow to really fast without any in-between setting.&lt;br /&gt;The jack at the end of the unit pops out constantly. I keep the cord tucked under my arm to keep it from coming out.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is two feet long, so get an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had:&lt;br /&gt;Carrying case&lt;br /&gt;Buffing bit</li>
            <li> It gets hot if use to long.&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to drill in the acrylic.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and it broke. Waste of money!!!!!!! Do not buy!!!!!!! I wouldnt even get them one star but i had to.</li>
            <li> PINK ELECTRIC PEN SHAPE NAIL DRIL ART MANICURE FILE TOOL 6-BITS. I like it  and its very nice but I wish it had at lease one bit with a sharp end that can clean out from under the finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than I thought it&#x27;d be. it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fantastic, it&#x27;s fantastic,it&#x27;s fantastic,it&#x27;s fantastic,it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> This nail drill is a little on the cheap side, hence the low price. But for the money, it does a super job! I love the way you can adjust the speed. It has the ability to go much faster than what you need to shape your nails. The bits included are ok, but I would have preferred a few more to include something to buff &amp; shine nails as well as shape them. Also, I like having a power cord rather than batteries. The plug-in power source provides more power than batteries would to run the drill at higher speeds. And saves you from spending a lot on frequent battery changes.</li>
            <li> I love it its great. it cuts down half the time of filing. I use these acrylic nails and it gets the job done</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for..Cheap Cheap Cheap!! The different bits do not stay in well and constantly feel loose.</li>
            <li> Have tried some others...and they all left me wanting more power. NO WAY was I going to use my Dremmel on my thick toe nails..... This little gem works great. AC power means not low powered battery units and no constant recharging of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a very nice selection of attachments. Frankly it looks a lot like my Dremmel.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product.</li>
            <li> Turns off in the middle of using it, even before it gets hot. Unreliable. If the thing would keep rotating, it would be a good product.</li>
            <li> I received your letter. I am pleased with your package and I have nothing but praise. I wish you all the best in the work.Best regards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the E-file for about a month now and have used it probably 6 or 7 times. This is a great little machine. I have an E-file that cost over $100 and yet I like this one better. I like that there is a wide range for the speed. It&#x27;s easy to switch bits, just push the button and unscrew the top, replace bit, and tighten it again. The different size and style bits are great. Over all I&#x27;m very happy with the product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I could not use the m/c since tha adapter is 110 input where my house is 220 . The m/c itself 100-240 but that is not compatable with the adapter !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than I thought it&#x27;d be. It&#x27;s not only a really cute color but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I choose this item because it&#x27;s lite weight reviews and price for my wife and she is in love with it</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. I love doing my own nails and this thing makes them look even more amazing! Also does wonders for the toes. It is pretty powerful and could do some damage if you&#x27;re not careful. It also tends to get a little hot if you run it too long, but other than that- it&#x27;s super! Cool little attachments came with it and the cord plugs in just fine.</li>
            <li> It really works well. I have very thick one nails and this item for the job does a very we&#x27;ll job of filing my nails down.</li>
            <li> I bought it &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; . This thing was broken because it never turned on. As soon as I opened my package, a used bit was still attatched! with obvious nail powder(yuck)... nothing was right about it ..</li>
            <li> After being used 3 times it broke.  I can&#x27;t get the bits to stay in and is now useless.  It did it&#x27;s job but it should last longer than a month.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, great product.  Thanks!! :D</li>
            <li> Worked 2 mo used only about 3 times junk</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> not worth the money speed to slow will stop spinning</li>
            <li> I got this product early which is a great thing! Nothing was broken and ever thing was intact, very light weight, and easy to use. IT IS GOOD FOR ACRYLIC NAIL ABD NATURAL NAILS, I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work for acrylic. The bad things are the handle can get warn if working with it a long time, and the bits are quite tricky to get it, and I can&#x27;t get the one in at all. Over all though it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This works great the frost couple times then the cord gets a glitch and you have to hold it at a perfect angle I border for it to work at all</li>
            <li> Great product. Love how easy is to use. I would recommend it to everyone to pay it. Love the prices.</li>
            <li> This is just what it said it was. However being lazy and quick to hit the buy button, I didn&#x27;t realize it is an overseas plug. Doesn&#x27;t work in America, I will get a converter to travel anyway. It would help if I had read ;) thanks though, great little product for the price.</li>
