            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love this bcdation!</li>
            <li>its great coverage that lasts all day, but one, it&#x27;s not picture friendly.</li>
            <li>The thickness and consistency was fine and had good coverage.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and and covers more like foundation than bb but still has the benefits a bb would offer.</li>
            <li>The product itself was actually ok</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would have given it more stars.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product and seller and will be repurchasing once I am out.</li>
            <li>i just love the packaging,</li>
            <li>the whole BB,CC cream, and foundation together is just great.</li>
            <li>I think I will buy this again unless I found something better</li>
            <li>It brightens my skin love it</li>
            <li>Its my favorite.</li>
            <li>because i really love the look on the skin</li>
            <li>the consistency is really light and more watery than most bb creams, cc creams, and foundations.</li>
            <li>on smoothly, and felt light (almost like I didn&#x27;t have make up on at all!)</li>
            <li>I dot the cream and have found that a good foundation brush works very well to distribute.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and it blends really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of coverage I need and gives a nice shine on your face.</li>
            <li>If you want coverage, it&#x27;s so easy to just layer</li>
            <li>however, my pores clog easily and i have acne prone skin, so this may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li>Beautiful coverage on Asian skinâ™¡</li>
            <li>It also gives a very nice smooth finish to the skin but the only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the dewyness of the finish.</li>
            <li>The color #2 is a little light for summer but winter will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Paired with Tony Moly Egg Pore Silky Smooth Balm, the finish looks air-brushed.  </li>
            <li>you are America&#x27;s version of &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; (which I thought I was - LOL), I definitely recommend this foundation.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is light to medium with a dewy look.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses the foundation and her skin looks smooth and dewey, so I asked her what she was using and she told me about this brand.</li>
            <li>the shades are definitely really light.</li>
            <li>The color is great for pale to dark beige skin tones, I&#x27;m in between warm and cool tone and it matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love that it has a pump and with two pumps you cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>This product is not bad but the smell/scent is yuck.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or normal skin it&#x27;ll end up looking awesome and fresh</li>
            <li>#1 bright pink beige was a bit too light.</li>
            <li>It has a light lemon scent ibut goes away very fast.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has a pump because it keeps the whole product very sanitary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#2 Natural beige is flattering for most complexions.  </li>
            <li>It offers great coverage compared to how much you use, one pump gives me full coverage on my entire face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for 4 stars is ONLY because, as is true with most Asian cosmetics, the darkest shade is still way too light.  </li>
            <li>This was delivered to me yesterday and used for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>i say that this last for 9 hours without touching up, that is if you powder in the beginning.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good coverage, also, it spreads pretty easily(compare to ordinary bb cream).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers up the acne scars on my face and gives a nice air brushed soft look.</li>
            <li>first, I thought the texture was &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; but noticed you really have to spread the product around your face because it&#x27;s concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I touch my face several times in a day and it never comes off, but washes off easily at night.</li>
            <li>is already a tiny bit lighter than i&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s easily fixed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i really liked the sample, so I was little disappointed)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent,</li>
            <li>and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend to anyone who wants to try bb but likes a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s similar to l&#x27;oreal magic nude liquid powder, but the consistency is definitely thicker.</li>
            <li>Only need a few drops to cover my entire face and the foundation makes my face look flawless (covers freckles, pimples, red spots).</li>
            <li>I am a true, natural beige in all American brands, I am not a sun worshipper, and my skin is undoubtedly medium/fair.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, only thing is I will have to buy one shade darker because I got a little tan over summer.</li>
            <li>this tends to made my forehead more oily than usual, but it&#x27;s nothing a powder can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>For other shades in foundations that i use Loreal true match w2.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of old lady make-up.</li>
            <li>I wish Asian manufacturers would &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; that their Western market is rapidly growing and even for paler people, their &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; shades are simply too light.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my face cakey, really makes my face feel plump, gives that dewy look which I like for my asian skin.</li>
            <li>and so far this hasn&#x27;t cause any acne at all.</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t cover up the redness much, but it also doesn&#x27;t further irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li>And I highly recommend the Egg Pore Balm, even if you use a different foundation.</li>
            <li>product works really well for dry or dry/combo skin.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for an everyday full coverage long wearing foundation with a dewy finish, i highly recommend this tony moly bcDation.</li>
            <li>it has light to medium coverage and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>but, unfortunately, the Revlon actually made the Tony Moly enhance fine lines (which is why I stopped using the Revlon Age Rewind in the first place).  </li>

            <li> but, unfortunately, the Revlon actually made the Tony Moly enhance fine lines (which is why I stopped using the Revlon Age Rewind in the first place).  </li>
            <li> but if you have extremely oily skin like me, you definitely need to use a mattifying lotion or primer with this (especially in the summer).</li>
            <li> but it does dry onto your skin, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any transfer of sorts.</li>
            <li> I then dab just a bit additional product onto any dark or red spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sheer, but buildable, so the few small dark spots I have nearly disappear and even after 12+ hours, there is no oiliness anywhere.  </li>
            <li> but when mix with other foundations, it gives me the radiant glow</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and a little bit oily on my nose.</li>
            <li> , I felt this is little bit different than a sample I received few months ago</li>
            <li> Because of my oily skin I have to powder to tone down the glowy/shiny at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Because the consistency is not super thick, if you do half a pump you can blend it out for sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> i wish i could use this everyday :(</li>
            <li> works really bad alone</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to smell myself and was making myself sick.</li>

            <li> This product is not bad but the smell/scent is yuck. It reminds me of old lady make-up. I thought the scent would go away after a while but it took hours before it went away. I couldn&#x27;t stand to smell myself and was making myself sick. So, I only used it twice and gave it to a friend. The product itself was actually ok but because I have allergies, I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Otherwise I would have given it more stars. The thickness and consistency was fine and had good coverage. But like I said, for me, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I think Shiseido and L&#x27;Occtane products have that same smell, that is why I don&#x27;t use those brands.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good coverage, also, it spreads pretty easily(compare to ordinary bb cream).&lt;br /&gt;But, I felt this is little bit different than a sample I received few months ago (i really liked the sample, so I was little disappointed)&lt;br /&gt;However, overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of BCdation when I purchased another Tony Moly product and just had to purchase this product. This is the best cover up foundation I have used. It covers up the acne scars on my face and gives a nice air brushed soft look. The fact that it has SPF in it was a plus because now I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying SPF lotion to my face before my makeup. All in all, I love this product and seller and will be repurchasing once I am out.</li>
            <li> Beautiful coverage on Asian skinâ™¡</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s  just the right amount of coverage I need and gives a nice shine on your face. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!  Paired with Tony Moly Egg Pore Silky Smooth Balm, the finish looks air-brushed.  It is sheer, but buildable, so the few small dark spots I have nearly disappear and even after 12+ hours, there is no oiliness anywhere.  I dot the cream and have found that a good foundation brush works very well to distribute.  I then dab just a bit additional product onto any dark or red spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars is ONLY because, as is true with most Asian cosmetics, the darkest shade is still way too light.  I am a true, natural beige in all American brands, I am not a sun worshipper, and my skin is undoubtedly medium/fair.  I wish Asian manufacturers would &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; that their Western market is rapidly growing and even for paler people, their &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; shades are simply too light.  To remedy the color issue, I tried to mix a bit of Revlon foundation in a darker color with the Tony Moly but, unfortunately, the Revlon actually made the Tony Moly enhance fine lines (which is why I stopped using the Revlon Age Rewind in the first place).  That said, my current solution is to give a dusting of a darker mineral foundation after application.  I dislike having to do this because the finish without any additional product is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are America&#x27;s version of &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; (which I thought I was - LOL), I definitely recommend this foundation.  It hides/corrects/makes up in one step.  And I highly recommend the Egg Pore Balm, even if you use a different foundation.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this foundation from a friend. I love it! Only need a few drops to cover my entire face and the foundation makes my face look flawless (covers freckles, pimples, red spots). It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or like it has any foundation on. I touch my face several times in a day and it never comes off, but washes off easily at night. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I found out about this product by using a sample and I immediately looked it up after applying it. Bought it months ago and still use it reguarly till this day. i just love the packaging, the whole BB,CC cream, and foundation together is just great. The coverage is amazing, only thing is I will have to buy one shade darker because I got a little tan over summer. I really like the scent, doesn&#x27;t make my face cakey, really makes my face feel plump, gives that dewy look which I like for my asian skin. Has 30 SPF+++ protection. The price is great, I think it is a must have and will continue to use it. I really love Tonymoly&#x27;s and Etude house&#x27;s foundations/bb&amp;CC creams and this is a great addition to your makeup bag ^^</li>
            <li> This was delivered to me yesterday and used for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;Went on smoothly, and felt light (almost like I didn&#x27;t have make up on at all!) If you want coverage, it&#x27;s so easy to just layer and it still goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a big fan and will not plan on use anything else when it comes to be creams and foundation!</li>
            <li> When i got this i thought that it wasnt going to fit my skin tone but its actually a perfect match, i got the shade 02. For other shades in foundations that i use Loreal true match w2. I have dry skin and a little bit oily on my nose. i say that this last for 9 hours without touching up, that is if you powder in the beginning. Love that it has a pump and with two pumps you cover your whole face. the coverage with 2 pumps is medium and it is build-able.</li>
            <li> works really bad alone but when mix with other foundations, it gives me the radiant glow</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of great things about this foundation. It offers great coverage compared to how much you use, one pump gives me full coverage on my entire face. Because the consistency is not super thick, if you do half a pump you can blend it out for sheer coverage. The color is great for pale to dark beige skin tones, I&#x27;m in between warm and cool tone and it matches me perfectly. It also gives a very nice smooth finish to the skin but the only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the dewyness of the finish. If you have dry or normal skin it&#x27;ll end up looking awesome and fresh but if you have extremely oily skin like me, you definitely need to use a mattifying lotion or primer with this (especially in the summer). I also love the fact that it has a pump because it keeps the whole product very sanitary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for couples of month now and it works very well for me. The color #2 is a little light for summer but winter will be perfect. (MUFE duo mat 202 or 201) The coverage is light to medium with a dewy look. It has a light lemon scent ibut goes away very fast. Because of my oily skin I have to powder to tone down the glowy/shiny at the end of the day and so far this hasn&#x27;t cause any acne at all. But i do double cleansing at the end of the day. I think I will buy this again unless I found something better</li>
            <li> Got one as a gift and I loved it so much, I am ordering it for all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought the texture was &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; but noticed you really have to spread the product around your face because it&#x27;s concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Natural beige is flattering for most complexions.  #1 bright pink beige was a bit too light.</li>
            <li> It brightens my skin love it</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it blends really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> this is the best bb cream I have ever used. Its my favorite. Nice texture and and covers more like foundation than bb but still has the benefits a bb would offer. I would reccomend to anyone who wants to try bb but likes a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> Works great! My daughter uses the foundation and her skin looks smooth and dewey, so I asked her what she was using and she told me about this brand. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> love this bcdation! it has light to medium coverage and a little goes a long way! the consistency is really light and more watery than most bb creams, cc creams, and foundations. it&#x27;s similar to l&#x27;oreal magic nude liquid powder, but the consistency is definitely thicker. the shades are definitely really light. i&#x27;m a Desert Beige in Estee Lauder Double Wear and No. 2 is already a tiny bit lighter than i&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;this product works really well for dry or dry/combo skin. i have combo skin and i get a bit oily on my forehead throughout the day. this tends to made my forehead more oily than usual, but it&#x27;s nothing a powder can&#x27;t fix. with that being said, i don&#x27;t recommend this for those with oily skin, but if you do get it, a setting powder is needed. after i set this foundation, i&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;this doesn&#x27;t fix or cover up hyperpigmentation. i have acne here and there and sometimes it gets really red. this product doesn&#x27;t cover up the redness much, but it also doesn&#x27;t further irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, i have to say i&#x27;m very pleased with this product. i use my fingers to apply it because i use it as a daily bcdation since it has spf in it. it doesn&#x27;t feel drying but it does dry onto your skin, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any transfer of sorts. once it fully dries, it doesn&#x27;t budge until you need it to.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for an everyday full coverage long wearing foundation with a dewy finish, i highly recommend this tony moly bcDation. its great coverage that lasts all day, but one, it&#x27;s not picture friendly. two, it breaks me out. however, my pores clog easily and i have acne prone skin, so this may not be the case for everyone. i wish i could use this everyday :( because i really love the look on the skin</li>
            <li> Medium coverage with no staying power. Not too liquidy and a bit drying.</li>
    </ol>
