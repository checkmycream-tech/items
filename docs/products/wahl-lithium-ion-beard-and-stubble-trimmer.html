    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent in every way.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li>but once he used it he said it was the best trimmer he has ever used.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best way I can describe them.</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>Great buy!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is excellent.</li>
            <li>Great value!</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m not the best at remembering to charge things like this</li>
            <li>weight and compact - perfect for travelers / campers.&lt;br /&gt;Doubles</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t revise this review, you can assume it&#x27;s still operating wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Excellent beard trimmer</li>
            <li>best trimmer i ever bought.</li>
            <li>The best Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>What a brilliant idea.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d imagine works incredibly well with the zero setting (hence, the stubble look reviews)...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a very good product and a good value.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>A great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great beard trimmer/shaver</li>
            <li>The stubble settings are great too.</li>
            <li>The razor itself looks great</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>However, it works great for trimming hair to a medium length with the plastic guard on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Once I discovered that it has been a great trimmer</li>
            <li>Great unit.  </li>
            <li>Worked great before it broke.</li>
            <li>Not to happy about it.</li>
            <li>Great clipper.</li>
            <li>Great battery life.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>With a name like Wahl, I was confident that this would be an excellent product for cutting/ trimming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you&#x27;re a person who doesn&#x27;t need fine control over your trim length, this is an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for light beards/goatees/mustaches/sideburns.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I should have held onto the couple reviews that mentioned, &amp;#34;great for stubble look&amp;#34;, because that&#x27;s about all its good for.</li>
            <li>I always heard good things about Wahl trimmers, so I wanted to give one a shot.</li>
            <li>craftsmanship of the blades is quite good...</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE IS GOOD.</li>
            <li>I loved the battery life.</li>
            <li>I was looking for one with good battery life.</li>
            <li>As advertised, ergonomic, good battery life, just a tad on the noisy side</li>
            <li>nice to hold - great ergonomics</li>
            <li>Looks Good.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, good quality.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly by how much better this unit is.</li>
            <li>Hubby says it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>A nice mark to go with your gouge.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li>He has quite a beard and likes to keep it nice but needed some help</li>
            <li>(I also own an electric toothbrush and shaver), it isn&#x27;t quite up to par on how well it holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>No 8 fittings filling your bag, 2 nice clips with a lock</li>
            <li>I bought this for him for Christmas after researching every kind imaginable.  </li>
            <li>Does the job ... Very strong</li>
            <li>High quality blade, good battery life, great performance.</li>
            <li>powerful motor, great battery, guide inadequate.  </li>
            <li>it works great , well worth the upgrade.. learn how to shave with  this shaver and  find out it isn&#x27;t noisy and does not pull and cut  and not have to charge batteries.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t offer very fine</li>
            <li>The adjustable settings should be perfect for giving them a nice fade around the sides and back of their hair.</li>
            <li>A fine piece of Hungarian craftsmanship!</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and loud - im VERY impressed.</li>
            <li>Love that I can charge and get weeks of shaves.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as close, and I don&#x27;t know what trimmer this claims to have &amp;#34;2x more power&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If there is a lithium ion battery in this thing, it can&#x27;t be any more potent than a button cell, seeing as the 2 AA&#x27;s in my cheapo have to be near-death for it to run at the speed of this one..</li>
            <li>Generally love Wall products , but if you have a goatee , the trimmer attachments  </li>
            <li>He said it fit well in his hand and gave him a nice shave.</li>
            <li>find it really works great ..</li>
            <li>After reading amazon reviews of this trimmer I elected to give Wahl one more chance.</li>
            <li>This one feels much more like a quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give one more star if it had a level 1.5 setting.</li>
            <li>and I think the Li-Ion battery will hold out better.</li>
            <li>Spend even just 5 dollars more for something else.  </li>
            <li>Wahl products have been the choice of professionals for many years.  </li>
            <li>the motor was still screaming for more.</li>
            <li>switch :)</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s still a good trimmer I have to report that the non-replaceable battery inside is far from good.</li>
            <li>All I can say is it is OK.</li>
            <li>Nothing any more.</li>
            <li>Glad I did not return it for a credit.  </li>
            <li>but I guess OK</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty darned good trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I first got it, I still thought it was a good decision.</li>
            <li>Batter life is phenomenal compared to others on the market and it charges very quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more money on shavers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer for bikini area due to skin sensitivity and researched the latest &amp; greatest models, including those for women.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that the this trimmer is sharper and seem to fit my hand better.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I immediately bought a Norelco Multigroom 7300 - which is fantastic - from Costco since I didn&#x27;t want to give amazon any more of my trimmer money.  </li>
            <li>Received the item very quickly and it works as the package says.  </li>
            <li>There are two length guides included, and switching them is easy.</li>
            <li>holds a charge and easy to use</li>
            <li>strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li>Probably would be ok for full beards ????</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is worthy of the name!  </li>
            <li>On a positive note: the battery is still amazing.</li>
            <li>The grip is so comfortable it feels like your not even holding anything.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy trying to hide it until it grows out</li>
            <li>Use the included oil to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation.</li>
            <li>It handled it well and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great, the problem is that you spend twice the time trimming as you need to go over the same areas again and again.  </li>
            <li>Only had it for just over a month and it works great so</li>
            <li>Blade guards seem cheap.  </li>
            <li>It also feels rugged, not plasticy and cheap.</li>
            <li>Have had it only a couple months, but it cuts great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most intelligent and minimally designed trimmer ive ever seen.</li>
            <li>Fantastic grip and VERY POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and cuts like a charm</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lithium charges very fast and lasts for ever - what more do u want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light, flimsy, and with a battery life of about 15 seconds at full charge.</li>
            <li>I got more consistent length by going perpendicular.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1O1UCLMPVRKVB]]I was so excited to get this Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Price was right!</li>
            <li>Nice design, powerful motor, lighter than the older models, good stand, and a much smaller charger than before.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with another men&#x27;s Wahl trimmer, as I had such great luck with the first one.  </li>
            <li>The most effective shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not just a marketing line, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Recommend a full size trimmer first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new one is just as great as the old one.  </li>
            <li>Strong battery, multiple settings, and a nice built in guard.</li>
            <li>these are really great, they keep razor sharp and stay charged forever.</li>
            <li>This is my third Wahl in the last 15 years and it is the best yet.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see a huge problem with the guard at first.</li>
            <li>far.&lt;br /&gt;For fun tried using on a full beard</li>
            <li>The company not only can&#x27;t do it right the first time, they can&#x27;t even fix their own products anymore!</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll just buy a new one and try to be more careful/</li>
            <li>First time I used these clippers my neighbor downstairs thought I was running a hedge trimmer in my apartment, a bit noisy but worth it!</li>
            <li>For anything neater than that, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor</li>
            <li>Powerful motor</li>
            <li>Power was worth the noise.</li>
            <li>The guard system is clever and any accumulated hair brushes off easily.</li>
            <li>the motor is powerful and the battery lasts for weeks i have tried to like the guard but</li>
            <li>/&gt;First use:&lt;br /&gt;I had 10 days worth of beard gnawing at me - this thing tore thru it like butter..</li>
            <li>I LOVE it so far</li>
            <li>Works well so far, battery seems to hold up well and the adjustments are quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It seems like it was pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li>It was plugged in overnight, but there&#x27;s no light to indicate that its successfully charging.</li>
            <li>The blades are good, straight and sharp</li>
            <li>By this time (maybe 3 or 4 minutes), the face of the trimmer is so HOT that it will BURN your face.</li>
            <li>Nice simple trimmer that I mostly use for a rough shave 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>standard guard works OK.  </li>
            <li>first beef with the guard came when I forgot to lock it.</li>
            <li>The smaller blade allow for better contouring around the jaw line and under the nose</li>
            <li>My first experience with them was 3 years ago with another model</li>
            <li>It hung on for years but finally cracked from being dropped too many times.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Gets very close for a beard trimmer leaving just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li>It is very good, but just like any other beard trimmers, it takes very long to trim the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, cuts very well, The attachments leave some rooms to be desired though and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I what I really miss the most is a smaller attachment for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>You can read all the positive reviews and believe them.</li>
            <li>The problem is that because it is adjustable in one direction only, if you tip it to far forward (or don&#x27;t follow the contour of your face perfectly), it will GOUGE your beard and you will have an uneven cut.</li>
            <li>Love the long battery life of this.</li>
            <li>The first was purchased in 1999 and was a very sturdy and reliable tool.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Wahl beard trimmer with this and am satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp!  </li>
            <li>A powerful beard trimmer that is quite easy to handle; however, the number of settings for the adjustable comb guide is limited, and none of the settings trim to my preferred beard length.</li>
            <li>really fine / accurate down to stubble</li>
            <li>However, the much-vaunted trimmer guide - while more elegant than the old multiple-guide setup - simply doesn&#x27;t have the enough settings from which to choose!</li>
            <li>The charging unit is low profile and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about what he uses on his face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a suitable replacement for my 5 year old beard and stubble trimmer that would get close enough for me</li>
            <li>My old Wahl trimmer actually only worked in that way, which is much more comfortable for trimming your facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The height settings work very well and do not slip out af adjustment.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>, I really wish there was a length setting between the two lengths I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Be gentle if you get one.</li>
            <li>Seems they can add a red light to let you know you&#x27;ve made the connection for charging.</li>
            <li>There is perhaps too much of a gap between the level 1 trim and the level 2 trim.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s only been a few months) and especially love the guard next to the blade.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this trimmer for women!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, says this is the one he would have bought for himself.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying you can do better for less, which isn&#x27;t exactly a shining</li>
            <li>Only down side (if you can call it that) is that it works so good he has to be much more careful when he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
            <li>Strong motor, the edge shaves right down to the skin.</li>
            <li>I do like that the guard locks at different levels, but I liked my old guard better which was closed on the front and not just the back.</li>
            <li>I explained that I had not received very much use from this product and it was clearly defective, not worn out.</li>
            <li>Ok, so for about 5 years I&#x27;ve had a cheap little AA-Battery powered Wahl trimmer kit I picked up for 12 bucks at the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>All good for the price .. could be smaller and less noisy though.</li>
            <li>I had to shave it off for the first time in nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a full charge before my next shave, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>If it had usb and titanium - it would kill everything else - but on the size, performance and  power its hands down better than anything ive seen /</li>
            <li>A little bit on the loud side, but since it works so nicely- who cares?  </li>
            <li>The entire thing feels cheaper and more flimsy, with only the rubber grips offering a saving grace.</li>
            <li>The comb portion which sets the length is a low quality (a replacement is included so they must know it is a weakness), and it must always be returned to the bottom to protect it - again, adding time to what used to be a fairly quick part of my morning routine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why the model that costs twice as much seems to sell way better as this does absolutely everything I need.</li>
            <li>I like the usb and titanium of the remington - but couldnt dismiss the claimed 3 hours and high</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I could use the attachment guides from my old trimmer which worked very well, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>The blade on this new model is the same and would accommodate my older guides except that the plastic body of the new trimmer is fashioned differently and gets in the way of the better old style trim guides, which need to snap into place.</li>
            <li>This seems like a design flaw, but I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but like I said earlier they are kind of harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; bought a few trimmers over the years,this is by far the most convienent.keeps</li>
            <li>It has one cheap plastic guard that slides up and down the back with very large adjustments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I read the instructions and properly charged and lubricated the trimmer before it&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe the battery was running low</li>
            <li>It is also louder than most I have used in the past</li>
            <li>Excellent for anything from long hair to stubble cutting.</li>
            <li>The only selling point this truely has over my old, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough, CHEAPER Wahl, is that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend a little more money next time</li>
            <li>Sure it trims, but there is hardly any adjustment to it.  </li>
            <li>far it has gone at least 2 months between charges, on about 3 uses per week, which I consider outstanding performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightyears ahead of my old buzzy Li-Ion model.</li>
            <li>last week.. didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>And the lowest setting is far from stubble.  </li>
            <li>Had to purchase this as I had forgot to pack my old one.  </li>
            <li>(which is 7-10 years old)  </li>
            <li>When I opened it I was surprised to see that there are two adjustable guards.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the second Wahl product I have sent back for repair without success.</li>
            <li>The one caveat I would like to put out is that the adjustable length guide is very different from other beard trimmers, even the last Wahl I had, and you might find yourself trimming more than you expected if you don&#x27;t hold it a certain way over your whole face.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is good, but the trim guide attachment that keeps it at a set height is a very poor design.  </li>
            <li>but I tried to trim on the 5th or 6th setting and it was a 30 minute ordeal to clean up the uneven trim and &amp;#34;chopped/uneven&amp;#34; feeling all over.</li>
            <li>Big improvement  of the older models.</li>
            <li>Major improvement over the old rusty trimmer I had,</li>
            <li>I waited this long to review it because I really wanted to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>So I would just be careful when trying out these guards for the first time.  </li>
            <li>On one setting you&#x27;re trimming too much, and on the next not enough.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty frequently and it works pretty well, with only a few minor complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful little motor and a close trim.</li>
            <li>very loud....cannot clean behind head....</li>
            <li>Currently it goes for 39.99 on Amazon and 58.00 direct from Conair.</li>
            <li>My old Wahl&#x27;s lithium battery finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I expect to get the same life out of this Wahl as I have the old one.  </li>
            <li>The only con, it&#x27;s quite loud, so brace yourself.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll use this a few times a week for years, it&#x27;s worth a couple bucks over the crappier $15 versions you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for my earlier model 9867, which was about 5 years old and the Lithium Ion battery was becoming weak.  </li>
            <li>This newer trimmer has a cheap 7 position adjustable trim guide that may be more convenient than an assortment of individual guides, but it does not work anywhere near as well, and in my view is practically worthless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisy and a little messy, but definitely better than the easier to find brand-names.</li>
            <li>This little unit is EXACTLY what I need.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking at the 9854 I&#x27;d strongly recommend thinking long and hard about what you need your trimmer to do.</li>
            <li>But the battery life is fantastic requiring little down-time due to charging.</li>
            <li>The guard/guide has a lot of different length settings and the battery has lasted a really long time on one charge so far.</li>
            <li>If you just want a little hair on your face, not so much.</li>
            <li>They tell you to go with the grain which accomplishes nothing except knocking down the high spots.</li>

            <li> Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li> but once he used it he said it was the best trimmer he has ever used.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best way I can describe them.</li>
            <li> Great Product!</li>
            <li> Great buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great value!</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not the best at remembering to charge things like this</li>
            <li> weight and compact - perfect for travelers / campers.&lt;br /&gt;Doubles</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t revise this review, you can assume it&#x27;s still operating wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer</li>
            <li> best trimmer i ever bought.</li>
            <li> The best Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> What a brilliant idea.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d imagine works incredibly well with the zero setting (hence, the stubble look reviews)...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a very good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> A great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer/shaver</li>
            <li> The stubble settings are great too.</li>
            <li> The razor itself looks great</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a great rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> However, it works great for trimming hair to a medium length with the plastic guard on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Once I discovered that it has been a great trimmer</li>
            <li> Great unit.  </li>
            <li> Worked great before it broke.</li>
            <li> Not to happy about it.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.</li>
            <li> Great battery life.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> With a name like Wahl, I was confident that this would be an excellent product for cutting/ trimming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re a person who doesn&#x27;t need fine control over your trim length, this is an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for light beards/goatees/mustaches/sideburns.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I should have held onto the couple reviews that mentioned, &amp;#34;great for stubble look&amp;#34;, because that&#x27;s about all its good for.</li>
            <li> I always heard good things about Wahl trimmers, so I wanted to give one a shot.</li>
            <li> craftsmanship of the blades is quite good...</li>
            <li> OTHERWISE IS GOOD.</li>
            <li> I loved the battery life.</li>
            <li> I was looking for one with good battery life.</li>
            <li> As advertised, ergonomic, good battery life, just a tad on the noisy side</li>
            <li> nice to hold - great ergonomics</li>
            <li> Looks Good.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, good quality.</li>
            <li> was pleasantly by how much better this unit is.</li>
            <li> Hubby says it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> A nice mark to go with your gouge.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li> He has quite a beard and likes to keep it nice but needed some help</li>
            <li> (I also own an electric toothbrush and shaver), it isn&#x27;t quite up to par on how well it holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> No 8 fittings filling your bag, 2 nice clips with a lock</li>
            <li> I bought this for him for Christmas after researching every kind imaginable.  </li>
            <li> Does the job ... Very strong</li>
            <li> High quality blade, good battery life, great performance.</li>
            <li> powerful motor, great battery, guide inadequate.  </li>
            <li> it works great , well worth the upgrade.. learn how to shave with  this shaver and  find out it isn&#x27;t noisy and does not pull and cut  and not have to charge batteries.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t offer very fine</li>
            <li> The adjustable settings should be perfect for giving them a nice fade around the sides and back of their hair.</li>
            <li> A fine piece of Hungarian craftsmanship!</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and loud - im VERY impressed.</li>
            <li> Love that I can charge and get weeks of shaves.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close, and I don&#x27;t know what trimmer this claims to have &amp;#34;2x more power&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If there is a lithium ion battery in this thing, it can&#x27;t be any more potent than a button cell, seeing as the 2 AA&#x27;s in my cheapo have to be near-death for it to run at the speed of this one..</li>
            <li> Generally love Wall products , but if you have a goatee , the trimmer attachments  </li>
            <li> He said it fit well in his hand and gave him a nice shave.</li>
            <li> find it really works great ..</li>
            <li> After reading amazon reviews of this trimmer I elected to give Wahl one more chance.</li>
            <li> This one feels much more like a quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give one more star if it had a level 1.5 setting.</li>
            <li> and I think the Li-Ion battery will hold out better.</li>
            <li> Spend even just 5 dollars more for something else.  </li>
            <li> Wahl products have been the choice of professionals for many years.  </li>
            <li> the motor was still screaming for more.</li>
            <li> switch :)</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still a good trimmer I have to report that the non-replaceable battery inside is far from good.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it is OK.</li>
            <li> Nothing any more.</li>
            <li> Glad I did not return it for a credit.  </li>
            <li> but I guess OK</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty darned good trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I first got it, I still thought it was a good decision.</li>
            <li> Batter life is phenomenal compared to others on the market and it charges very quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more money on shavers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer for bikini area due to skin sensitivity and researched the latest &amp; greatest models, including those for women.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that the this trimmer is sharper and seem to fit my hand better.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I immediately bought a Norelco Multigroom 7300 - which is fantastic - from Costco since I didn&#x27;t want to give amazon any more of my trimmer money.  </li>
            <li> Received the item very quickly and it works as the package says.  </li>
            <li> There are two length guides included, and switching them is easy.</li>
            <li> holds a charge and easy to use</li>
            <li> strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li> Probably would be ok for full beards ????</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is worthy of the name!  </li>
            <li> On a positive note: the battery is still amazing.</li>
            <li> The grip is so comfortable it feels like your not even holding anything.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy trying to hide it until it grows out</li>
            <li> Use the included oil to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation.</li>
            <li> It handled it well and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great, the problem is that you spend twice the time trimming as you need to go over the same areas again and again.  </li>
            <li> Only had it for just over a month and it works great so</li>
            <li> Blade guards seem cheap.  </li>
            <li> It also feels rugged, not plasticy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Have had it only a couple months, but it cuts great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most intelligent and minimally designed trimmer ive ever seen.</li>
            <li> Fantastic grip and VERY POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and cuts like a charm</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lithium charges very fast and lasts for ever - what more do u want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light, flimsy, and with a battery life of about 15 seconds at full charge.</li>
            <li> I got more consistent length by going perpendicular.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1O1UCLMPVRKVB]]I was so excited to get this Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Price was right!</li>
            <li> Nice design, powerful motor, lighter than the older models, good stand, and a much smaller charger than before.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go with another men&#x27;s Wahl trimmer, as I had such great luck with the first one.  </li>
            <li> The most effective shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not just a marketing line, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Recommend a full size trimmer first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new one is just as great as the old one.  </li>
            <li> Strong battery, multiple settings, and a nice built in guard.</li>
            <li> these are really great, they keep razor sharp and stay charged forever.</li>
            <li> This is my third Wahl in the last 15 years and it is the best yet.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a huge problem with the guard at first.</li>
            <li> far.&lt;br /&gt;For fun tried using on a full beard</li>
            <li> The company not only can&#x27;t do it right the first time, they can&#x27;t even fix their own products anymore!</li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;ll just buy a new one and try to be more careful/</li>
            <li> First time I used these clippers my neighbor downstairs thought I was running a hedge trimmer in my apartment, a bit noisy but worth it!</li>
            <li> For anything neater than that, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor</li>
            <li> Powerful motor</li>
            <li> Power was worth the noise.</li>
            <li> The guard system is clever and any accumulated hair brushes off easily.</li>
            <li> the motor is powerful and the battery lasts for weeks i have tried to like the guard but</li>
            <li> /&gt;First use:&lt;br /&gt;I had 10 days worth of beard gnawing at me - this thing tore thru it like butter..</li>
            <li> I LOVE it so far</li>
            <li> Works well so far, battery seems to hold up well and the adjustments are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It seems like it was pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li> It was plugged in overnight, but there&#x27;s no light to indicate that its successfully charging.</li>
            <li> The blades are good, straight and sharp</li>
            <li> By this time (maybe 3 or 4 minutes), the face of the trimmer is so HOT that it will BURN your face.</li>
            <li> Nice simple trimmer that I mostly use for a rough shave 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> standard guard works OK.  </li>
            <li> first beef with the guard came when I forgot to lock it.</li>
            <li> The smaller blade allow for better contouring around the jaw line and under the nose</li>
            <li> My first experience with them was 3 years ago with another model</li>
            <li> It hung on for years but finally cracked from being dropped too many times.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Gets very close for a beard trimmer leaving just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but just like any other beard trimmers, it takes very long to trim the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, cuts very well, The attachments leave some rooms to be desired though and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I what I really miss the most is a smaller attachment for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> You can read all the positive reviews and believe them.</li>
            <li> The problem is that because it is adjustable in one direction only, if you tip it to far forward (or don&#x27;t follow the contour of your face perfectly), it will GOUGE your beard and you will have an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> Love the long battery life of this.</li>
            <li> The first was purchased in 1999 and was a very sturdy and reliable tool.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Wahl beard trimmer with this and am satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp!  </li>
            <li> A powerful beard trimmer that is quite easy to handle; however, the number of settings for the adjustable comb guide is limited, and none of the settings trim to my preferred beard length.</li>
            <li> really fine / accurate down to stubble</li>
            <li> However, the much-vaunted trimmer guide - while more elegant than the old multiple-guide setup - simply doesn&#x27;t have the enough settings from which to choose!</li>
            <li> The charging unit is low profile and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about what he uses on his face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a suitable replacement for my 5 year old beard and stubble trimmer that would get close enough for me</li>
            <li> My old Wahl trimmer actually only worked in that way, which is much more comfortable for trimming your facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The height settings work very well and do not slip out af adjustment.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> , I really wish there was a length setting between the two lengths I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Be gentle if you get one.</li>
            <li> Seems they can add a red light to let you know you&#x27;ve made the connection for charging.</li>
            <li> There is perhaps too much of a gap between the level 1 trim and the level 2 trim.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s only been a few months) and especially love the guard next to the blade.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this trimmer for women!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it, says this is the one he would have bought for himself.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying you can do better for less, which isn&#x27;t exactly a shining</li>
            <li> Only down side (if you can call it that) is that it works so good he has to be much more careful when he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
            <li> Strong motor, the edge shaves right down to the skin.</li>
            <li> I do like that the guard locks at different levels, but I liked my old guard better which was closed on the front and not just the back.</li>
            <li> I explained that I had not received very much use from this product and it was clearly defective, not worn out.</li>
            <li> Ok, so for about 5 years I&#x27;ve had a cheap little AA-Battery powered Wahl trimmer kit I picked up for 12 bucks at the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> All good for the price .. could be smaller and less noisy though.</li>
            <li> I had to shave it off for the first time in nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a full charge before my next shave, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> If it had usb and titanium - it would kill everything else - but on the size, performance and  power its hands down better than anything ive seen /</li>
            <li> A little bit on the loud side, but since it works so nicely- who cares?  </li>
            <li> The entire thing feels cheaper and more flimsy, with only the rubber grips offering a saving grace.</li>
            <li> The comb portion which sets the length is a low quality (a replacement is included so they must know it is a weakness), and it must always be returned to the bottom to protect it - again, adding time to what used to be a fairly quick part of my morning routine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure why the model that costs twice as much seems to sell way better as this does absolutely everything I need.</li>
            <li> I like the usb and titanium of the remington - but couldnt dismiss the claimed 3 hours and high</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I could use the attachment guides from my old trimmer which worked very well, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> The blade on this new model is the same and would accommodate my older guides except that the plastic body of the new trimmer is fashioned differently and gets in the way of the better old style trim guides, which need to snap into place.</li>
            <li> This seems like a design flaw, but I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but like I said earlier they are kind of harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; bought a few trimmers over the years,this is by far the most convienent.keeps</li>
            <li> It has one cheap plastic guard that slides up and down the back with very large adjustments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I read the instructions and properly charged and lubricated the trimmer before it&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe the battery was running low</li>
            <li> It is also louder than most I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Excellent for anything from long hair to stubble cutting.</li>
            <li> The only selling point this truely has over my old, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough, CHEAPER Wahl, is that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend a little more money next time</li>
            <li> Sure it trims, but there is hardly any adjustment to it.  </li>
            <li> far it has gone at least 2 months between charges, on about 3 uses per week, which I consider outstanding performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightyears ahead of my old buzzy Li-Ion model.</li>
            <li> last week.. didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> And the lowest setting is far from stubble.  </li>
            <li> Had to purchase this as I had forgot to pack my old one.  </li>
            <li> (which is 7-10 years old)  </li>
            <li> When I opened it I was surprised to see that there are two adjustable guards.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the second Wahl product I have sent back for repair without success.</li>
            <li> The one caveat I would like to put out is that the adjustable length guide is very different from other beard trimmers, even the last Wahl I had, and you might find yourself trimming more than you expected if you don&#x27;t hold it a certain way over your whole face.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good, but the trim guide attachment that keeps it at a set height is a very poor design.  </li>
            <li> but I tried to trim on the 5th or 6th setting and it was a 30 minute ordeal to clean up the uneven trim and &amp;#34;chopped/uneven&amp;#34; feeling all over.</li>
            <li> Big improvement  of the older models.</li>
            <li> Major improvement over the old rusty trimmer I had,</li>
            <li> I waited this long to review it because I really wanted to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> So I would just be careful when trying out these guards for the first time.  </li>
            <li> On one setting you&#x27;re trimming too much, and on the next not enough.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty frequently and it works pretty well, with only a few minor complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful little motor and a close trim.</li>
            <li> very loud....cannot clean behind head....</li>
            <li> Currently it goes for 39.99 on Amazon and 58.00 direct from Conair.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl&#x27;s lithium battery finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> I expect to get the same life out of this Wahl as I have the old one.  </li>
            <li> The only con, it&#x27;s quite loud, so brace yourself.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll use this a few times a week for years, it&#x27;s worth a couple bucks over the crappier $15 versions you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my earlier model 9867, which was about 5 years old and the Lithium Ion battery was becoming weak.  </li>
            <li> This newer trimmer has a cheap 7 position adjustable trim guide that may be more convenient than an assortment of individual guides, but it does not work anywhere near as well, and in my view is practically worthless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy and a little messy, but definitely better than the easier to find brand-names.</li>
            <li> This little unit is EXACTLY what I need.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at the 9854 I&#x27;d strongly recommend thinking long and hard about what you need your trimmer to do.</li>
            <li> But the battery life is fantastic requiring little down-time due to charging.</li>
            <li> The guard/guide has a lot of different length settings and the battery has lasted a really long time on one charge so far.</li>
            <li> If you just want a little hair on your face, not so much.</li>
            <li> They tell you to go with the grain which accomplishes nothing except knocking down the high spots.</li>
            <li> Could not praise it enough after many&lt;br /&gt;many long time to charge, short charge lasting electric trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This job is filthy enough without being greeted with last months hair trimmings that refuse to come off with just a light and quick brushing like the rest of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re sporting a stubble beard I&#x27;d recommend a Norelco because there are only two stubble lengths; too short &amp; too long.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever negative review Amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes from being long enough to grab the hairs to almost a stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This not only works well but the lithium ion battery ensures it will have a long life.</li>
            <li> At its largest setting my once full beard was chopped to millimeters thin.  </li>
            <li> Not bad , but no great either.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the adjustable guard slips if you put too much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it is a bit noisy, but not ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li> but i think i have waited to long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the closed guard next and give my kids hair a trim.  </li>
            <li> long as I can get 2-3 years out of the battery like my Remington I would buy another</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> See, the thing only comes with two guard attachments that hook on and then slide up or down to adjust for the desired facial hair length.</li>
            <li> I sent it back to Wahl for repair and the repaired unit pulled hair and skin only slightly less frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are super sharp and don&#x27;t leave any missed hairs behind.</li>
            <li> My chin hair doesn&#x27;t grow very long, but I do like to keep something between stubble and a beard there</li>
            <li> If you need to trim a very long (&amp;#62;1 inch) beard, you may need something else.</li>
            <li> but when I let my beard go a little bit, the number 2 which is the 2nd closest setting doesn&#x27;t really do a thing; so I press it hard against my jawline</li>
            <li> Tapped it on the side of the sink to shake off some loose hairs and the blade came off and broke into 4-5 pieces.</li>
            <li> I like to keep hair from curling down on my upper lip and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This replacement is less expensive and very powerful.  </li>
            <li> This morning I had one of the most painful trims ever.  </li>
            <li> I was about to pick up the remington hc5550, but it was HUGE, heavy and looks totally flashy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few minutes several times each week for 2-3 months now</li>
            <li> Battery last quite a few days before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> Dead simply operation, just set the guard, flip it on, and go.</li>
            <li> Battery died after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Works as expected for an inexpensive trimmer.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful using this item.</li>
            <li> Luckily I trim my beard pretty short to begin with, so it wasn&#x27;t that devastating for me to just trim it all at the shortest length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4stars is because the guard is strange and takes a little getting used to, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Now it will pinch me when I&#x27;m trimming sensitive areas, no good.</li>
            <li> Also works well at keeping my small goatee short like I like it.</li>
            <li> (stubble is so sharp</li>
            <li> One has an &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; front and the other guard has a &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; front.  </li>
            <li> The smaller one works for anything from a small stubble to a neat beard.</li>
            <li> Really really sharp.</li>
            <li> Started getting a little rough on my skin, so figured time to upgrade: Enter the Wahl Lithium-Ion Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life and power aren&#x27;t fantastic but aren&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I would return it in a second if I weren&#x27;t one stinking day too late.</li>
            <li> This time the jolt from me setting down on the counter caused the head to come off.  </li>
            <li> Noticed zero slowing down on the battery - its tireless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Noticed zero slowing down on the battery - its tireless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> You may find, as I did, that this unit at half the price does everything you need.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smaller cutter allows for tight corners but can do hair gr8&lt;br /&gt;REALLY</li>
            <li> but just a little load by your ear.</li>
            <li> Yes, the guard is a little flimsy, but don&#x27;t mistreat it and it won&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I had to let it charge for a little while before using it.</li>
            <li> The design of this guard creates a little bit of space that allows the hair to fall away rather than clog the blades.  </li>
            <li> It shoots the hairs out all over the place and the two plastic guides are a little clunky for use.  </li>
            <li> this, forget dumb touch screen vacuum trimmers!</li>
            <li> then the metal can be a little harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mime</li>
            <li> The silver Wahl groomsman was an absolute disappointment.</li>
            <li> #2 is now dead.  </li>
            <li> The plastic actually feels worse.</li>
            <li> Somehow having the AC adapter connected for a few days drained the battery.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll get one that comes with the narrow attachment.</li>
            <li> So.. i have owned a few things, amongst others clippers and</li>
            <li> Not sure what the benefit is of the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; one is since it seems this one would allow you to mess up the length you are trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li> but with a smaller cutting area and an odd holding angle compared to other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered pulled hair and skin mercilessly.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that the unit will finally fail beyond use and I am wary of purchasing another Wahl which is a shame since the cutting blades are the best in all the beard trimmers I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hair follicles with painful metal grabby-hands.</li>
            <li> - Wahls usually are.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this is the last Wahl product I will purchase.</li>
            <li> I obsessed over this decision for like a week before finally going with this model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is, but you cannot use it at</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t keep a charge as well as trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The blade is so dull that it would not even trim my beard and the motor</li>
            <li> I learned the lesson the hard way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Charger - like almost every other, is 110v only :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least I hope it didn&#x27;t, or someone had their beard ripped from</li>
            <li> It really sucks because hairs get caught in it</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider my beard incrediy thick</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard that I like to trim on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> is so slow</li>
            <li> This thing was absolutely worthless and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this 2 stars until I thought of the poor suckers that like the 5:O&#x27;clock shadow look!&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hate it still use my old one</li>
            <li> U wont be disappointed : plus it comes  with 30day money back satisfaction guarantee (mine did), not that i care,</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s gross to talk about, and I hate that I have to trim it.</li>
            <li> Alas...  </li>
            <li> My poor, unsatisfied beard...</li>
            <li> Not Great</li>
            <li> i have a real hard time getting an even cut on my gotee.</li>
            <li> This is too small a clipper head for my liking, others may not think it&#x27;s that bad.  </li>
            <li> BUT WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get my beard trimmed at a length I want.</li>
            <li> unable to evenly trim beard with included guide.  </li>
            <li> One of the plastic bits broke so that I was unable to reassemble it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I figured for $10 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Turned out, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a plastic base, charger, some oil for the blade, and a small brush.</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> This way works, but it&#x27;s awkward.  </li>
            <li> Not as crazy about the beard guard.</li>
            <li> Complaints  about noise.., pulling hair cutting skin etc. ..</li>
            <li> I was afraid the just didn&#x27;t make them like they used to, and that Wahl had become a disposable brand.</li>
            <li> so it wont change size during cutting.</li>
            <li> as hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Great intuitive and minimalistic fittings for ALL your cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;Lock</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now impossible to use the trimmer without plugging it into an outlet as the battery holds no charge anymore.</li>
            <li> but it will painfully cut.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked at how bad this product is.</li>
            <li> This clipper is dangerous and painful, do not order it under any circumstances!</li>
            <li> But I was incredibly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> after 5-6 uses I&#x27;m disappointed in the trimmer and going to try and return it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Wahl.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m dragging it out becauseI hate that I shelled out $40 for this thing)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s terrible, but I&#x27;m going to look for something else</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I needed. Powerful motor</li>
            <li> Works great. The closest stubble trimmer I have used. Powerful motor but just a little load by your ear. Power was worth the noise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Target yesterday.  This morning I had one of the most painful trims ever.  It constantly pulled my beard as it hacked through the hair.  The &#x27;adjustable&#x27; plastic guide does not have measurements like the &#x27;solid&#x27; ones and is flimsy.  At its largest setting my once full beard was chopped to millimeters thin.  I had to shave it off for the first time in nearly 20 years.  The only thing you can say about this device is that it will cut.  Not what or how you want but it will painfully cut.  You will regret purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Does the job ... Very strong</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve come to expect fro Wahl.  A quality trimmer after my last one lasted around 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for 9 months, use it 1-2 times per week, and recharged it only once.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t 100% allergic to water.</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way.  Love that I can charge and get weeks of shaves.  Very effective. Could not praise it enough after many&lt;br /&gt;many long time to charge, short charge lasting electric trimmers.  This is the one to get.</li>
            <li> A great beard trimmer. The guard/guide has a lot of different length settings and the battery has lasted a really long time on one charge so far.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty darned good trimmer for the price. Perfect for light beards/goatees/mustaches/sideburns. I&#x27;ve used it for a few minutes several times each week for 2-3 months now and I still haven&#x27;t charged it. Lightyears ahead of my old buzzy Li-Ion model. The guard system is clever and any accumulated hair brushes off easily. Seems like it will last a while. Only complaint is it is a bit noisy, but not ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Works well and trims beard well. However if you&#x27;re sporting a stubble beard I&#x27;d recommend a Norelco because there are only two stubble lengths; too short &amp; too long. Otherwise good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Received the item very quickly and it works as the package says.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice design, powerful motor, lighter than the older models, good stand, and a much smaller charger than before.  However, the much-vaunted trimmer guide - while more elegant than the old multiple-guide setup - simply doesn&#x27;t have the enough settings from which to choose! On one setting you&#x27;re trimming too much, and on the next not enough.  For me, that&#x27;s a deal-breaker which if I&#x27;d noticed within the grace period would have had me returning the product for a refund. (I was growing my beard longer at the time of purchase, and notice now only because I am back to regular trimming.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re a person who doesn&#x27;t need fine control over your trim length, this is an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more money on shavers, but this one is the best. Strong motor, the edge shaves right down to the skin. Great beard trimmer/shaver</li>
            <li> A fine piece of Hungarian craftsmanship! First time I used these clippers my neighbor downstairs thought I was running a hedge trimmer in my apartment, a bit noisy but worth it! These things eat facial hair and will do it for hours on end. Sometimes I wish my beard grew faster just so I can whip this thing out and eradicate every last hair. The grip is so comfortable it feels like your not even holding anything.  these are really great, they keep razor sharp and stay charged forever. The stubble settings are great too. The only con of these trimmers are you will be beating women off with a stick when they are coming after your well groomed face.</li>
            <li> it broke... last week.. didn&#x27;t use it very often. disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not bad , but no great either. It will do for the time being.</li>
            <li> Shame on you, the reviewers for 46% of you giving this product 5 stars. And shame on Wahl for putting their name on this inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;1) Their facial hair guide comb is a joke and they know it. They tell you to go with the grain which accomplishes nothing except knocking down the high spots. You need to go against the growth to raise it away from the face to let the trimmer cut it to length. The problem is that because it is adjustable in one direction only, if you tip it to far forward (or don&#x27;t follow the contour of your face perfectly), it will GOUGE your beard and you will have an uneven cut. Enjoy trying to hide it until it grows out and you can try again.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;2) The next step after trimming your beard is to remove the guide comb and shape the outline around your beard. By this time (maybe 3 or 4 minutes), the face of the trimmer is so HOT that it will BURN your face. A nice mark to go with your gouge. I was going to give this 2 stars until I thought of the poor suckers that like the 5:O&#x27;clock shadow look!&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;3) STICKY RUBBER GROOVES hold,,,,,, is it last weeks or last months hair trimmings. What a brilliant idea. This job is filthy enough without being greeted with last months hair trimmings that refuse to come off with just a light and quick brushing like the rest of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I read the instructions and properly charged and lubricated the trimmer before it&#x27;s first use. Also the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; guide comb I think is meant to prevent gouging still does nothing for raising the hair so it can be trimmed properly.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is I sent it back for a refund and purchased a Conair 20-Piece Lithium Ion Haircut Kit from Amazon for 24.99 during a &amp;#34;timed&amp;#34; sale. Currently it goes for 39.99 on Amazon and 58.00 direct from Conair. My beard is even again and I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Nice simple trimmer that I mostly use for a rough shave 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has gone at least 2 months between charges, on about 3 uses per week, which I consider outstanding performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the combs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for about 5 months.</li>
            <li> Update August 2015.  I dropped it once and it was toast after that.  update October 2015.  Since I dropped it, I figured it was my fault so I ordered another one.  This time the jolt from me setting down on the counter caused the head to come off.  looks like Wahl razor #2 is now dead.  I am done with wahl.  It does its job. I use it almost daily.  Battery last quite a few days before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> Guard only works if you push it like you would a hair clipper.  You cannot turn it over as you would to trim and also expect the guard to work.  My old Wahl trimmer actually only worked in that way, which is much more comfortable for trimming your facial hair.  This way works, but it&#x27;s awkward.  And the lowest setting is far from stubble.  The lowest setting is a beard.  I tried every type of guard it came with and the adjustable height guard on the lowest setting is the only thing usable.  If you have a Santa beard, then this might work well.  If you just want a little hair on your face, not so much.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl&#x27;s lithium battery finally gave out.  This replacement is less expensive and very powerful.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of trimmer.</li>
            <li> i WAS LEARY ABOUT THIS BEING TOO BIG TO TRIM A MUSTASCHE BUT WAS WRONG. Althought any bigger in the head width and it would be. I like to keep hair from curling down on my upper lip and this does the trick. Also works well at keeping my small goatee short like I like it. The height settings work very well and do not slip out af adjustment. I ise the fist notch up from the lowest setting to dictate the length of mustache and goatee. Battery seems to last too. have only charged it once since it arrived. I use it every 4 to six days.</li>
            <li> Price was right! Does not hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever negative review Amazon. But I was incredibly disappointed with this product. I should have held onto the couple reviews that mentioned, &amp;#34;great for stubble look&amp;#34;, because that&#x27;s about all its good for. I wouldn&#x27;t consider my beard incrediy thick but I tried to trim on the 5th or 6th setting and it was a 30 minute ordeal to clean up the uneven trim and &amp;#34;chopped/uneven&amp;#34; feeling all over. The razor itself looks great and I&#x27;d imagine works incredibly well with the zero setting (hence, the stubble look reviews)... But is not a legitimate beard trimmer. I&#x27;ll spend a little more money next time</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good, but the trim guide attachment that keeps it at a set height is a very poor design.  Difficult to get my beard trimmed at a length I want.</li>
            <li> Only had to charge once in the 4 months I&#x27;ve owned.  Battery life is excellent.  Use the included oil to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation.</li>
            <li> powerful motor, great battery, guide inadequate.  unable to evenly trim beard with included guide.  returned and purchsed another andis versa.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does not come with a charger and if I had known that I would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how bad this product is. I have a fairly thick beard that I like to trim on a weekly basis. I always heard good things about Wahl trimmers, so I wanted to give one a shot. The blade is so dull that it would not even trim my beard and the motor is so slow (yes I fully charged it) that it would even get caught in my beard sometimes. I will not be buying another Wahl at any point.</li>
            <li> Ok, so for about 5 years I&#x27;ve had a cheap little AA-Battery powered Wahl trimmer kit I picked up for 12 bucks at the local pharmacy. Looks like they still have them for about the same price here on Amazon. Started getting a little rough on my skin, so figured time to upgrade: Enter the Wahl Lithium-Ion Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing about this, despite being more expensive, is an improvement over my cheaper one. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close, and I don&#x27;t know what trimmer this claims to have &amp;#34;2x more power&amp;#34; than, but I doubt one that underpowered ever existed. At least I hope it didn&#x27;t, or someone had their beard ripped from it&#x27;s very hair follicles with painful metal grabby-hands. If there is a lithium ion battery in this thing, it can&#x27;t be any more potent than a button cell, seeing as the 2 AA&#x27;s in my cheapo have to be near-death for it to run at the speed of this one.. I&#x27;m not saying this won&#x27;t trim your beard - It will. I&#x27;m saying you can do better for less, which isn&#x27;t exactly a shining a endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the rest... Compared again to my cheapo... The plastic actually feels worse. The entire thing feels cheaper and more flimsy, with only the rubber grips offering a saving grace. The blades are good, straight and sharp - Wahls usually are. That&#x27;s all the positives I have to say about it, though... The blade guides will work for a shorter beard, but are likely to start snagging longer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly shocked this gets such good reviews. The only selling point this truely has over my old, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough, CHEAPER Wahl, is that it&#x27;s rechargeable. Whoopty doo.</li>
            <li> High quality blade, good battery life, great performance. I&#x27;m honestly not sure why the model that costs twice as much seems to sell way better as this does absolutely everything I need. Comes with a plastic base, charger, some oil for the blade, and a small brush. Dead simply operation, just set the guard, flip it on, and go. Battery life and power aren&#x27;t fantastic but aren&#x27;t bad either. Yes, the guard is a little flimsy, but don&#x27;t mistreat it and it won&#x27;t matter. I actually don&#x27;t use the guard anyway. If you&#x27;re looking at the 9854 I&#x27;d strongly recommend thinking long and hard about what you need your trimmer to do. You may find, as I did, that this unit at half the price does everything you need.</li>
            <li> Had to purchase this as I had forgot to pack my old one.  (which is 7-10 years old)  This new one is just as great as the old one.  I expect to get the same life out of this Wahl as I have the old one.  I have to admit that the this trimmer is sharper and seem to fit my hand better.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this is the last Wahl product I will purchase. One of the hairpin springs that controls the trimmer head broke rendering the trimmer unuseable. I had this product for about a month and used it maybe 20 times. Their customer service informed me that the clipper head was a &amp;#34;wear part&amp;#34; and not covered by the warenty. I explained that I had not received very much use from this product and it was clearly defective, not worn out. After receiving a lecture I was told they would make a one time exception and send me a replacement trimmer head, we wil see if it arrives. I am not a child, didn&#x27;t need a lecture. How about, don&#x27;t sell defective products.</li>
            <li> My chin hair doesn&#x27;t grow very long, but I do like to keep something between stubble and a beard there (stubble is so sharp and I don&#x27;t want to shave every day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take the guard off then the metal can be a little harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mime came with a second guard, not shown in the picture.  It really sucks because hairs get caught in it and it pulls them rather then cuts them.  Maybe they stopped providing it for that reason...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard guard works OK.  Like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t offer very fine control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is pretty good.  One time someone unplugged the AC adapter after it was charged, but they didn&#x27;t unplug the port from the shaver so it was still connected.  Somehow having the AC adapter connected for a few days drained the battery.  This seems like a design flaw, but I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The craftsmanship of the blades is quite good... but like I said earlier they are kind of harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SETTING BETWEEN 1 &amp; 2. OTHERWISE IS GOOD. HAVE ENOUGH JUICE TO FIX MY GOATEE.</li>
            <li> Always go with a Wahl.  I learned the lesson the hard way.  Use what the professionals use.  That&#x27;s not just a marketing line, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I did a TON of research on beard trimmers before I made this purchase. Ask my wife; she thought I was nuts. I obsessed over this decision for like a week before finally going with this model. I&#x27;ve had it for about six months now. I waited this long to review it because I really wanted to give it a chance. I really wanted to like it. But I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I still thought it was a good decision. I loved the battery life. I&#x27;ve gone well over a month without having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a huge problem with the guard at first. I did notice that I had to go over and over some spots, but I chalked that up to my beard not being that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first beef with the guard came when I forgot to lock it. See, the thing only comes with two guard attachments that hook on and then slide up or down to adjust for the desired facial hair length. There&#x27;s a lock that prevents it from moving once you&#x27;ve picked your length, but just one time I forgot to lock it...and I could see it happening again. Luckily I trim my beard pretty short to begin with, so it wasn&#x27;t that devastating for me to just trim it all at the shortest length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I shaved I decided to keep it at the shortest setting, but for some reason this time my beard hair kept getting caught and yanked. It freakin&#x27; hurt! At first I thought maybe the battery was running low so I gave it a full charge before my next shave, but that didn&#x27;t help. So basically the shortest setting is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I really wish there was a length setting between the two lengths I&#x27;ve tried. It goes from being long enough to grab the hairs to almost a stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I what I really miss the most is a smaller attachment for trimming nose hair. I know it&#x27;s gross to talk about, and I hate that I have to trim it. And I knew going in that this model didn&#x27;t come with it. But when I replace this, which will probably be soon (although I&#x27;m dragging it out becauseI hate that I shelled out $40 for this thing), I&#x27;ll get one that comes with the narrow attachment.</li>
            <li> Love the long battery life of this. Not as crazy about the beard guard. I do like that the guard locks at different levels, but I liked my old guard better which was closed on the front and not just the back.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and cuts like a charm but when I let my beard go a little bit, the number 2 which is the 2nd closest setting doesn&#x27;t really do a thing; so I press it hard against my jawline and well...now it seems I have to use the number one setting(stubble) again.. sucks. But it&#x27;s a great rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; bought a few trimmers over the years,this is by far the most convienent.keeps the charge well&lt;br /&gt;and does the job.</li>
            <li> i have a real hard time getting an even cut on my gotee. the motor is powerful and the battery lasts for weeks i have tried to like the guard but after 5-6 uses I&#x27;m disappointed in the trimmer and going to try and return it but i think i have waited to long</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son for Christmas. It was not the one he orginally wanted but once he used it he said it was the best trimmer he has ever used.</li>
            <li> Works well and does what it claims</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  Only complaint is the adjustable guard slips if you put too much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> Battery died after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Generally love Wall products , but if you have a goatee , the trimmer attachments  don&#x27;t work very well. Probably would be ok for full beards ????</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this shaver. He said it fit well in his hand and gave him a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Tapped it on the side of the sink to shake off some loose hairs and the blade came off and broke into 4-5 pieces. One of the plastic bits broke so that I was unable to reassemble it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, it&#x27;s just fragile. Be gentle if you get one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far it&#x27;s great.  I had the Wahl groomsman, which lasted ten years and finally gave up and stop taking a charge.  So I figured I&#x27;d stick with Wahl and went with the lithium ion this time.  When I opened it I was surprised to see that there are two adjustable guards.  One has an &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; front and the other guard has a &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; front.  That&#x27;s the best way I can describe them. Not sure what the benefit is of the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; one is since it seems this one would allow you to mess up the length you are trying to achieve.  Maybe it moves through coarse beard hair easier.  So I would just be careful when trying out these guards for the first time.  I like that there&#x27;s not 4 or 5 different guards to keep track of.  Just the two which act as 6 each.  I used the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; one on my face on the shortest setting after growing my beard out for a week.  It handled it well and was comfortable.  The guard helped it from scratching my skin.  It seems like it was pretty powerful.  I&#x27;m going to try the closed guard next and give my kids hair a trim.  The adjustable settings should be perfect for giving them a nice fade around the sides and back of their hair.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but just like any other beard trimmers, it takes very long to trim the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for that price.</li>
            <li> It works well, with the shield on it. However, don&#x27;t try it without the guard- it&#x27;ll rip your hair out in chunks and you&#x27;ll end up hating the thing. I&#x27;m not sure why this is, but you cannot use it at it&#x27;s minimum setting without this happening. However, it works great for trimming hair to a medium length with the plastic guard on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I went to use it today and it didn&#x27;t charge. It was plugged in overnight, but there&#x27;s no light to indicate that its successfully charging. I had to let it charge for a little while before using it. Seems they can add a red light to let you know you&#x27;ve made the connection for charging.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my earlier model 9867, which was about 5 years old and the Lithium Ion battery was becoming weak.  I was hoping that I could use the attachment guides from my old trimmer which worked very well, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  The blade on this new model is the same and would accommodate my older guides except that the plastic body of the new trimmer is fashioned differently and gets in the way of the better old style trim guides, which need to snap into place. This newer trimmer has a cheap 7 position adjustable trim guide that may be more convenient than an assortment of individual guides, but it does not work anywhere near as well, and in my view is practically worthless.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this trimmer because of the guide.</li>
            <li> With a name like Wahl, I was confident that this would be an excellent product for cutting/ trimming.  I was wrong.  The battery life is great, the problem is that you spend twice the time trimming as you need to go over the same areas again and again.  The comb portion which sets the length is a low quality (a replacement is included so they must know it is a weakness), and it must always be returned to the bottom to protect it - again, adding time to what used to be a fairly quick part of my morning routine.  It is also louder than most I have used in the past so I now need to trim in the evening as to not disturb those who are still sleeping.  But the battery life is fantastic requiring little down-time due to charging.</li>
            <li> Big improvement  of the older models. find it really works great .. read some of the unfavorable reviews  before buying so was pleasantly by how much better this unit is. Complaints  about noise.., pulling hair cutting skin etc. .. hog wash. it works great , well worth the upgrade.. learn how to shave with  this shaver and  find out it isn&#x27;t noisy and does not pull and cut  and not have to charge batteries.  Great buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Wahl trimmer purchase. The first was purchased in 1999 and was a very sturdy and reliable tool. When the battery started to weaken after over 12 years of daily use, I decided to replace it. The silver Wahl groomsman was an absolute disappointment. Light, flimsy, and with a battery life of about 15 seconds at full charge. I was afraid the just didn&#x27;t make them like they used to, and that Wahl had become a disposable brand. After reading amazon reviews of this trimmer I elected to give Wahl one more chance. This trimmer has resorted my faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice weight and balance. Strong battery, multiple settings, and a nice built in guard. The design of this guard creates a little bit of space that allows the hair to fall away rather than clog the blades.  This one feels much more like a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with an earlier review.  There is perhaps too much of a gap between the level 1 trim and the level 2 trim.  Level 1 leaves about a 3pm shadow.  Level 2 leaves about 5 days growth.  For chest and arms, the manual recommends shaving against the direction of growth. I got more consistent length by going perpendicular. Results may vary I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good product and a good value. I&#x27;d give one more star if it had a level 1.5 setting.</li>
            <li> I was looking for one with good battery life. Have had it for a month &amp; haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my Son-in-love. He has quite a beard and likes to keep it nice but needed some help</li>
            <li> This is excellent. You&#x27;ll use this a few times a week for years, it&#x27;s worth a couple bucks over the crappier $15 versions you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for $24 and it feels like a much more expensive gizmo. There are two length guides included, and switching them is easy. The smaller one works for anything from a small stubble to a neat beard. The second is for longer beards and sideburns. If you need to trim a very long (&amp;#62;1 inch) beard, you may need something else. For anything neater than that, this is a great little trimmer. The charging unit is low profile and easy to pack. It comes with a simple plastic stand, the two guides, a comb, and some lubricant for the blades. Major improvement over the old rusty trimmer I had, and I think the Li-Ion battery will hold out better.</li>
            <li> Sure it trims, but there is hardly any adjustment to it.  It has one cheap plastic guard that slides up and down the back with very large adjustments.  Spend even just 5 dollars more for something else.  I immediately bought a Norelco Multigroom 7300 - which is fantastic - from Costco since I didn&#x27;t want to give amazon any more of my trimmer money.  I would return it in a second if I weren&#x27;t one stinking day too late.</li>
            <li> It broke two months after buying it, would not charge or work, not the quality I would expect from Wahl. And I was using it twice per week</li>
            <li> Wahl products have been the choice of professionals for many years.  This beard trimmer is worthy of the name!  Great value!</li>
            <li> Bought this for some finer trimming. Only had it for just over a month and it works great so far.&lt;br /&gt;For fun tried using on a full beard but it was not up to the task. Recommend a full size trimmer first.&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can get 2-3 years out of the battery like my Remington I would buy another</li>
            <li> Works as expected for an inexpensive trimmer.  I use it pretty frequently and it works pretty well, with only a few minor complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t keep a charge as well as trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Granted, I&#x27;m not the best at remembering to charge things like this (I also own an electric toothbrush and shaver), it isn&#x27;t quite up to par on how well it holds a charge.  I probably have to charge it once every two weeks.  Not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Blade guards seem cheap.  Every time I use them I worry that I&#x27;ll break them.  They haven&#x27;t yet, though.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is as advertised, and I&#x27;d fully recommend this product; especially for the price!</li>
            <li> As advertised, ergonomic, good battery life, just a tad on the noisy side</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year...it will not charge anymore</li>
            <li> So.. i have owned a few things, amongst others clippers and so forth.. I was about to pick up the remington hc5550, but it was HUGE, heavy and looks totally flashy. I ended up taking this guy -&gt; 3 hours batt life / charge when the closest competitor (Remington) was 55 mins -&gt; i was sold. I like the usb and titanium of the remington - but couldnt dismiss the claimed 3 hours and high torque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use:&lt;br /&gt;I had 10 days worth of beard gnawing at me - this thing tore thru it like butter.. I then decided to cut my hair, no prob! Excellent for anything from long hair to stubble cutting. The motor is strong and loud - im VERY impressed. It also feels rugged, not plasticy and cheap. The smaller blade allow for better contouring around the jaw line and under the nose etc - I dont like regular size cutters for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most intelligent and minimally designed trimmer ive ever seen. No 8 fittings filling your bag, 2 nice clips with a lock so it wont change size during cutting. Fantastic grip and VERY POWERFUL. after 30 mins (not having charged it) the motor was still screaming for more. I couldnt believe it. If it had usb and titanium - it would kill everything else - but on the size, performance and  power its hands down better than anything ive seen / used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smaller cutter allows for tight corners but can do hair gr8&lt;br /&gt;REALLY strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Cuts really fine / accurate down to stubble&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and compact - perfect for travelers / campers.&lt;br /&gt;Doubles as hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Great intuitive and minimalistic fittings for ALL your cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;Lock switch :)&lt;br /&gt;Very nice to hold - great ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;Lithium charges very fast and lasts for ever - what more do u want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Charger - like almost every other, is 110v only :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, forget dumb touch screen vacuum trimmers! U wont be disappointed : plus it comes  with 30day money back satisfaction guarantee (mine did), not that i care, im keeping it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update after 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I havent plugged it in onec, and used it a bunch of times around 5-10 mins at a time. Noticed zero slowing down on the battery - its tireless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that keep the blades oiled - and this thing will carry on screamin, just like a blues train before the crossing.not that i care, im keeping it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update after 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I havent plugged it in onec, and used it a bunch of times around 5-10 mins at a time.

            <li> Have had it only a couple months, but it cuts great. It&#x27;s noisy and a little messy, but definitely better than the easier to find brand-names. If I don&#x27;t revise this review, you can assume it&#x27;s still operating wonderfully.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1O1UCLMPVRKVB]]I was so excited to get this Trimmer. Especially because of the Lithium Ion battery. I used it about 8 - 10 times, and then one day (3 months after I purchased it), I noticed that I was getting snagged by the blades. When I looked at the trimmer closely, I noticed that at one of the edges, the blades had actually chipped off. I&#x27;ve uploaded a video for you to see what I&#x27;m talking about (look at where I point it out with my thumb). I&#x27;m disappointed in Wahl. My first experience with them was 3 years ago with another model Wahl-9854-600 which also didn&#x27;t hold up. I reviewed that one (Wahl 9854-600) here http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MSIATEEL48TC#?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;tag&#x3D;heaprcom05-20&amp;linkCode&#x3D;ur2&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m heading back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer but with a smaller cutting area and an odd holding angle compared to other beard trimmers. I replaced an older Wahl beard trimmer with this and am satisfied overall. The one caveat I would like to put out is that the adjustable length guide is very different from other beard trimmers, even the last Wahl I had, and you might find yourself trimming more than you expected if you don&#x27;t hold it a certain way over your whole face. Once I discovered that it has been a great trimmer and I recommend it. Post review August 2015: While it&#x27;s still a good trimmer I have to report that the non-replaceable battery inside is far from good. It&#x27;s now impossible to use the trimmer without plugging it into an outlet as the battery holds no charge anymore. In fact, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work until I leave it plugged in for awhile as the battery somehow gets in the way of the DC current from the adapter and it needs to charge before you can use the trimmer will plugged in. I am afraid that the unit will finally fail beyond use and I am wary of purchasing another Wahl which is a shame since the cutting blades are the best in all the beard trimmers I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Serves the pupose, Like it</li>
            <li> This not only works well but the lithium ion battery ensures it will have a long life. Nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, good quality.</li>
            <li> This thing was absolutely worthless and a complete waste of money. :(&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but then, literally he second time I used it, the blade fell part and it disassembled into 8-10 pieces.  Alas...  My poor, unsatisfied beard...</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month</li>
            <li> All I can say is it is OK. Nothing any more.</li>
            <li> No dislikes about this product. I bought it as a gift for my brother for Christmas and he says he likes it and uses it every day with no problems. He has no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I figured for $10 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Turned out, I was wrong.  This is too small a clipper head for my liking, others may not think it&#x27;s that bad.  It shoots the hairs out all over the place and the two plastic guides are a little clunky for use.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s terrible, but I&#x27;m going to look for something else, it just doesn&#x27;t work the way I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my Wahl battery operated trimmer.  It hung on for years but finally cracked from being dropped too many times.  I use the trimmer for bikini area due to skin sensitivity and researched the latest &amp; greatest models, including those for women.  I decided to go with another men&#x27;s Wahl trimmer, as I had such great luck with the first one.  I LOVE it so far (it&#x27;s only been a few months) and especially love the guard next to the blade.  Would highly recommend this trimmer for women!</li>
            <li> This is my third Wahl in the last 15 years and it is the best yet. You can read all the positive reviews and believe them. Even the attachments work sell this time.</li>
            <li> best trimmer i ever bought.</li>
            <li> Hate it still use my old one</li>
            <li> All good for the price .. could be smaller and less noisy though.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about what he uses on his face. I bought this for him for Christmas after researching every kind imaginable.  He absolutely loves it, says this is the one he would have bought for himself. Only down side (if you can call it that) is that it works so good he has to be much more careful when he&#x27;s shaving. Battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp!  A little bit on the loud side, but since it works so nicely- who cares?  Hubby likes it.</li>
            <li> This clipper is dangerous and painful, do not order it under any circumstances! The first one I ordered pulled hair and skin mercilessly. I sent it back to Wahl for repair and the repaired unit pulled hair and skin only slightly less frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Wahl product I have sent back for repair without success. The company not only can&#x27;t do it right the first time, they can&#x27;t even fix their own products anymore! Farewell to a brand I used to trust.</li>
            <li> The most effective shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  The only con, it&#x27;s quite loud, so brace yourself.</li>
            <li> Great unit.  1st one ordered was defective, and Amazon replaced it.  Glad I did not return it for a credit.  This little unit is EXACTLY what I need.  Looooong battery life.  Powerful little motor and a close trim.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a suitable replacement for my 5 year old beard and stubble trimmer that would get close enough for me but this is definitely it. Gets very close for a beard trimmer leaving just the right amount of stubble. Batter life is phenomenal compared to others on the market and it charges very quick. Blades are super sharp and don&#x27;t leave any missed hairs behind.</li>
            <li> A powerful beard trimmer that is quite easy to handle; however, the number of settings for the adjustable comb guide is limited, and none of the settings trim to my preferred beard length.</li>
            <li> holds a charge and easy to use</li>
            <li> A metal part of the blade broke off after owning it for 35 days. Scratches my face now. Worked great before it broke.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, cuts very well, The attachments leave some rooms to be desired though and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not to happy about it.</li>
            <li> Looks Good. Not Great but I guess OK</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Really really sharp. You have to be careful using this item. Aside from that, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Bought this thing over a month ago and still haven&#x27;t had to plug it in! I think eventually the blade mechanism will wear out and need to be replaced, but the thing was only $16 so who cares?  Update: I have dropped this thing a couple of times into the sink and 2 of the blade pieces broke off. Now it will pinch me when I&#x27;m trimming sensitive areas, no good. I haven&#x27;t had any luck finding a blade replacement so I guess I&#x27;ll just buy a new one and try to be more careful/ On a positive note: the battery is still amazing.</li>
            <li> Great battery life. Great trimmer. 4stars is because the guard is strange and takes a little getting used to, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, battery seems to hold up well and the adjustments are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The best Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  I use it for stubble and beard.  Adjustable guide /guard works well.  Good price.</li>
            <li> very loud....cannot clean behind head....doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well....</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used! The battery is a beast! I love it. If you want a trimmer that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and do it well without a bunch of gimmick extras, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Hubby says it&#x27;s amazing</li>
