    <ol>
            <li>The product works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is impressive, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!  </li>
            <li>whitening has been great as well</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Also, did a great job cleaning my teeth,</li>
            <li>I loved it, two shades brighter in two days.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a good way to maintain that, but I&#x27;m seeing no change whatsoever in 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity at all in my teeth or gums, and love how easy this is to use.  </li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity at all in my teeth or gums, and love how easy this is to use.  </li>
            <li>first of all is a great brush and sturdy in your hand even if I’m not using the gel I have liked the electric brush</li>
            <li>Was hoping to see more encouraging reviews.  </li>
            <li>The instructions tell you, though, to start brushing in the front top and bottom areas since those places are more noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply made and does nothing more for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>What is great about this Go Smile system is that you just need to add a pea-sized drop of the included whitening gel along with your regular toothpaste, and it whitens your teeth while you brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an motorized toothbrush before and this made my teeth feel so incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing, especially since I&#x27;m a huge coffee and tea drinker.  </li>
            <li>I had been thinking about having my teeth professionally whitened this summer, but love the convenience of having this at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go Smile electric brush</li>
            <li>and I love the action of the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Much lighter after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely feel more clean and less plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok but not worth the cost</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it a few days, though, it feels more normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you get your teeth to your desired whiteness, you can use this as a normal toothbrush without the whitening gel, and then can use the gel as needed to maintain your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day most days, but a few days a week I use my old electric Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day most days, but a few days a week I use my old electric Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush head on this is pretty huge, so that was an adjustment for me -- especially since I have a small mouth (even though my husband might disagree with that ;-) ).  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush functions much as an electric one does, except that the head is larger than I normally use.</li>
            <li>It does remove most of the coffee stains of the day but over time, my teeth became a bit less white than when I was using the trays diligently.</li>
            <li>One caveat that became clear with longer use: It doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as the drippy trays.</li>
            <li>You can get your teeth as white with any decent electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Marked my teeth color on the color strip before starting system.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed as I have used the Go Smile whitening ampules with good success in the past.</li>
            <li>The old tray/strip system of tooth whitening at times left my teeth in slight pain when I accidentally left the tray on too long or used too much whitening gel.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and different from other tooth whitening systems</li>
            <li>after some delayed shipping issues the seller turned a bad experience into a good one</li>
            <li>Now there is one good and one bad.</li>

            <li> I wish I had spent the $130 on different ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So... if you are naughty like me and drink a lot of coffee/red wine, and wish to have gleamingly white teeth, you will need to supplement this with whitening strips or trays.</li>

            <li> kit comes with a little card that has a spectrum of shades on it that you can use to monitor your progress in whitening.  </li>
            <li> this little beauty has revolutionized my ability to wipe away evidence of my  coffee addiction.</li>
            <li> (My dental hygienist said that tea actually stains your teeth worse than coffee.)  </li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tooth color wasn&#x27;t bad, so I&#x27;ve noticed only a little lightening after 3 weeks of use once daily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to give it away as it made my sensitive teeth worse, fondly, Jenny.</li>
            <li> whitening gel doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any teeth sensitivity for me, the way that other whitening products have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used both whitening strips and gels that you put in trays in the past, but have always hated the taste of those products and tend to be lazy about keeping them in the recommended length of time.</li>

            <li> It did everything as advertised.</li>
            <li> I loved it, two shades brighter in two days. Unfortunately I had to give it away as it made my sensitive teeth worse, fondly, Jenny.</li>
            <li> The product works great! Visibly whiter teeth within a week and after some delayed shipping issues the seller turned a bad experience into a good one</li>
            <li> This did not work for me and the brush is too big!</li>
            <li> Following instructions for twice daily use, dry toothbrush and at least two weeks in, no changes.  Very disappointed in the product and its claims.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and have not seen any progress.  Was hoping to see more encouraging reviews.  Now there is one good and one bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from another online shopping site since their kit came with two replacement brush heads and an extra bottle of the whitening gel. I&#x27;ve been using this for only four days, and am amazed that it&#x27;s already lightened by teeth by three shades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both whitening strips and gels that you put in trays in the past, but have always hated the taste of those products and tend to be lazy about keeping them in the recommended length of time. What is great about this Go Smile system is that you just need to add a pea-sized drop of the included whitening gel along with your regular toothpaste, and it whitens your teeth while you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any teeth sensitivity for me, the way that other whitening products have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head on this is pretty huge, so that was an adjustment for me -- especially since I have a small mouth (even though my husband might disagree with that ;-) ).  Now that I&#x27;ve used it a few days, though, it feels more normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush also has a timer on it set with four thirty-second intervals, so you can brush all four quadrants of your mouth.  The instructions tell you, though, to start brushing in the front top and bottom areas since those places are more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a little card that has a spectrum of shades on it that you can use to monitor your progress in whitening.  As mentioned above, after just four days of using this twice a day, my teeth are three shades lighter.  That&#x27;s pretty amazing, especially since I&#x27;m a huge coffee and tea drinker.  (My dental hygienist said that tea actually stains your teeth worse than coffee.)  Once you get your teeth to your desired whiteness, you can use this as a normal toothbrush without the whitening gel, and then can use the gel as needed to maintain your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is impressive, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!

            <li> YES! After years of dentists foisting expensive custom made trays and drippy liquids on me....this little beauty has revolutionized my ability to wipe away evidence of my  coffee addiction. It takes the same amount of time to use this as my regular toothbrush.  Yay!!      The old tray/strip system of tooth whitening at times left my teeth in slight pain when I accidentally left the tray on too long or used too much whitening gel. That never happens with this system.    One caveat that became clear with longer use: It doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as the drippy trays. It does remove most of the coffee stains of the day but over time, my teeth became a bit less white than when I was using the trays diligently. I now supplement this daily toothbrushing with simple inexpensive OTC whitening strips on an occasional, ie about monthly, basis.     So... if you are naughty like me and drink a lot of coffee/red wine, and wish to have gleamingly white teeth, you will need to supplement this with whitening strips or trays. If you don&#x27;t consume foods which yellow your teeth this might be enough for you.</li>
            <li> Whitening cream is VERY expensive but after two weeks I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Does lighten the teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and different from other tooth whitening systems and I could never use the mouth piece system so I thought I would try this product.  The Go Smile electric brush first of all is a great brush and sturdy in your hand even if I’m not using the gel I have liked the electric brush and it doesn’t rattle my teeth when brushing.  My teeth definitely feel more clean and less plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening has been great as well I started noticing a difference in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing the results over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Terrific product - works like a charm! Much lighter after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush functions much as an electric one does, except that the head is larger than I normally use. My tooth color wasn&#x27;t bad, so I&#x27;ve noticed only a little lightening after 3 weeks of use once daily. I will keep using it, however. At least it undoes a days&#x27; worth of coffee, tea, and wine.</li>
            <li> Marked my teeth color on the color strip before starting system.  After 1 month of use, as directed, my teeth color is the same as day 1.  No whitening improvement.  My teeth feel cleaner, but teeth are not whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had zero results in the whitening area with this product. Very disappointed as I have used the Go Smile whitening ampules with good success in the past. I was hoping this would be a good way to maintain that, but I&#x27;m seeing no change whatsoever in 6 weeks of use. I&#x27;ll go back to what works in the future. I wish I had spent the $130 on different ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  You can get your teeth as white with any decent electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply made and does nothing more for your teeth.</li>
            <li> ok but not worth the cost</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve never used an motorized toothbrush before and this made my teeth feel so incredibly clean.  I have noticed several shades of lightening after just two weeks and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t expect really white teeth but it has whitened them and I love the action of the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the brush and I see a difference in my teeth.  They are whiter.</li>
            <li> Saw whitening results immediately.  Also, did a great job cleaning my teeth,</li>
