            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li>This is my Holy Grail conditioner and I would recommend this to anyone looking to eliminate warm tones or darken your hair!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner to cover up the highlights, and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Good job!</li>
            <li>I now mix with Clove and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It kind of grossed me out, but I applied the product liberally to my roots and worked it through the rest of my hair as best I could.</li>
            <li>Great for getting rid of brassy/red tones.</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been just as good.</li>
            <li>It still would have some coppery highlights in the full sun, which i wish were not there, but indoor lighting the color was perfect.</li>
            <li>Great experience all the way around &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Love the herbal scent, too!</li>
            <li>it does have a strong herbal smell, but the color pay off is great.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, I got it quick, and your price was the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>its AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Nice side benefit is that my guy loves how my hair smells after I use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the shipping couldn&#x27;t have been better !  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would give my hair a nice deeper darker shade and even more shine.</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>and I love the darker shade.</li>
            <li>I have tried this so many ways</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things!!! :)</li>
            <li>I use a conditioning mask before and after most times I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have my normal color back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After leaving it in for an hour (to be sure), ALL the hideous orange is gone and my hair looks incredibly healthy and fabulous.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it does a good job of softening hair without making it greasy looking.</li>
            <li>such beautiful results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions and leave the conditioner on your hair for the recommended time to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li>But for anyone with dark to medium brown hair, it&#x27;s great for deepening your hair colour, giving it a nice rich look.</li>
            <li>but this one is allergic free.</li>
            <li>Has made my hair so much healthier and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>like how smooth and conditioning this is as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even really condition your hair!!!</li>
            <li>Great &#x27; touch up&#x27; in between color for grey hair.</li>
            <li>All I wanted was some rich, chocolate brown hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, leaves my hair super shiny , and best of all, covers the red.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because it also deposits a bit of color on your hands and specially your nails if you don&#x27;t have nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought this product feeling confident that it would, if nothing else, smell nice and perhaps make the faded bits of my hair color a little more even.  </li>
            <li>It also has nice conditioning properties, leaving my hair feeling fuller and soft, but it does not have alot of slip.</li>
            <li>But every time I dyed it, no matter how neutral or cool of a color I used it would ALWAYS turn reddish.  </li>
            <li>If you give a quick scrub with soap followed by a rinse, this is not a problem.  </li>
            <li>Also, rinse your hands quickly after you put the product in your hair because it will temporarily stain them purple.</li>
            <li>If you have very porous or damaged hair, especially if it is light and lacking red pigments, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>so I prefer to use more natural products to keep them strong and healthy; they tend to turn brown or red.</li>
            <li>On light hair I&#x27;d mix the teeniest bit with another conditioner before trying this straight.  </li>
            <li>Such an amazing hair product</li>
            <li>If you want to take the natural light tones out of your hair, this is the way to do it!  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this conditionner because it also leaves my hair soft and moisturized, my hair looks  like I had gone to the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>(Which looked horrid on me because I have such a warm skin tone</li>
            <li>I understand that this product is not meant to cover gray, but based on some of the reviews it seemed like it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>Can stain, but just rinse hands and tub right away</li>
            <li>Went through the product very fast.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair with some warm highlights and my hair had become very dry</li>
            <li>My hair feels a bit stripped after the shampoo (and it rinses out some of the previous days color), but after conditioning my hair is super soft and silky, with amazing shine!</li>
            <li>They also said i could return the products I had not used, if there was more than 50% left</li>
            <li>It does not last more that two washes.</li>
            <li>I buy it always from you, thanks on this one amazon!</li>
            <li>I first put this product on my hair</li>
            <li>I left the product on for about 30 minutes since many reviewers said to leave it on longer for darker coverage - it also says this on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It looks like I had overall color done, but without the cost and additional damage to my hair. :)</li>
            <li>how long I leave it on, I can get anywhere from a deep cool brown to just a deeper richer colour than my own.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with this product.</li>
            <li>Even after it washes out, my hair really isn&#x27;t reddish anymore.</li>
            <li>It is herbal, but in a very medicine-y way.  </li>
            <li>The whole time the smell was nauseating me, but I tried to ignore it.  </li>
            <li>Too much?</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured, so too much slip can make it look flat anyway.</li>
            <li>I leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes (the first time I used it, I left it on for 20min, fyi) before a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>At the very least, it smelled nice and was a nice, thick texture which made application easy.</li>
            <li>I am shocked that so many people say that it has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want, makes my over-dyed hair return to its natural cool-tones.</li>
            <li>At full disclosure, I&#x27;ll say I didn&#x27;t read the back of the bottle before applying.  </li>
            <li>Toned down the reddish/gold tones in my medium brown hair, giving it a more ashy tone.</li>
            <li>Love Aveda Black Malva conditioner.</li>
            <li>May be good if you have black hair, to help cover some grey.</li>
            <li>Zebra&#x27;s are cute, but not necessarily the new fashion statement for a human.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra $ to have a product that delivers</li>
            <li>I have found that a little extra conditioning and using a nice oil (argan, coconut, etc) will help combat this.  </li>
            <li>and I cant live without it.</li>
            <li>First try I left it in for about 5 minutes...</li>
            <li>I love that it tones down the red tones in my hair and makes it a cooler color.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is if you have light blonde or gray hair it ends up with a barely noticeable  bluish color to it.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair that gets a little ashy if I don&#x27;t do anything to it.</li>
            <li>They were very unsympathetic to me, told me that I could buy their clarifying shampoo to try to help remove the blue streaks.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a medium brown with both ash and coppery tones.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month along with the shampoo and have made sure to condition for at least 15 minutes during each use.</li>
            <li>I recommend applying this, outside the shower onto dry hair first using some of those plastic gloves, and then get in and rinse it off when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li>It did not affect my white roots at all and the rest of my hair looked exactly the same as it had before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely packs a punch of color as it is highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I even have purple streaks in my hair &amp; when they fade &amp; start looking kinda pinkish/purple and washed out, this brings them back to a deep rich purple without making them look black or brown.</li>
            <li>I am an ash brown naturally, so I have been looking to restore that without using peroxide and further damaging the hair.</li>
            <li>I color my hair dark ash brown and nothing is more annoying than when my color fades into a bronze tone, which happens pretty easily when I go out in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, however, that if you had blonde hair before black it will leave hair with a greenish tone.</li>
            <li>i dyed my hair from brown to black and this maintains the color really well.</li>
            <li>I wish it had dyed my hair half as much as it dyed my shower and tile.</li>
            <li>I once even applied it and left it on for 40 minutes when the stylist did my hair too light once, it came out purplish brown, but at least it wasn&#x27;t brassy!</li>

            <li> after washing and conditioning one time my brown hair color was back to normal with a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> It is normally shiny, soft, with very few grey hair .</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time because you only need to use a couple times a week.  </li>
            <li> It definitely saves money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have applied it to dry hair and left it on for an hour before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is a medium reddish brown naturally, and this tends to turn it a slightly ashier-colored version of reddish brown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Black Malva deepened the colour and depending on how frequently I use it and</li>
            <li> Not only that, after it was dry, there was NO DIFFERENCE in my hair color.  </li>
            <li> However, it does dry my hair out a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> for those of you who do not want the \\&quot;boot black\\&quot; look of a permanent dye and to take the red out of dark hair - terrific</li>
            <li> also, it smells a bit, but the smell doesnt stay long at all.</li>
            <li> And, I haven&#x27;t needed to dye my hair in a long time since this keeps the ashiness at bay.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years and recently had my blonde hair dyed black.</li>
            <li> The only catch for me was that the very ends of my hair were brutalized by a bad salon bleach job, so there wasn&#x27;t really any red remaining in some straw like strands.</li>
            <li> It does help with removing red hints in my dark brown hair but does not darken my hair at all.</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair in the brown to dark blonde range and brass is a problem, this product could be your answer.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair as black as the first day by depositing subtle color and gives it shine.</li>
            <li> I have applied it to wet hair</li>
            <li> The service was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> If we could only get ridif the messy hand stain after applying sans gloves.</li>
            <li> I have some highlights, but they are only about level 6-7 and no issues with them turning green.</li>
            <li> A little does NOT go a long way.</li>
            <li> This definitely makes my dark brown hair closer to black!  </li>
            <li> I have very dark brown, almost black hair, and I recently had some highlights done.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little bit messy( you have to be careful not to get any on painted surfaces or white plastic shower fixtures, because it will stain), but it works like gangbusters.  </li>
            <li> My hair has very little gray so that isn&#x27;t a big problem for me.</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair dried it and applied the black malva conditioner and left it on for an hour.</li>
            <li> This works but it leaves my hair a little dry after.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of some of those tinctures that chinese herbalists prescribe - they can be very pungent and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that when colored chocolate goes brassy eventually.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair</li>
            <li> I used Sun In for my dark brown hair even though it wasn&#x27;t recommended on the product instructions.</li>
            <li> I have medium lenght dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This product will go in the trash very soon; that&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how dark it made my hair after one hour.</li>
            <li> It worked but washed out (not a permanent fix) and ultimately not worth the money</li>
            <li> With the help of this conditioner I can tone that brassy down.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, i wouldnt say it drastically changes the colour of your hair, but in the sun, my black hair used to look a bit brownish, but now it looks totally black!!</li>
            <li> My hair is a medium ashy brown, which is why I lean towards the clove products and then add the black malva.  </li>
            <li> I have used Aveda Black Malva shampoo and conditioner for years.  </li>
            <li> I got a lighter,shiny but slightly reddish orange tint to my hair.</li>
            <li> After doing some research I decided to try the Alveda Black Melva shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> After I have used Aveda Black Malva conditioner, my hair is not shiny anymore</li>
            <li> Instead of redying my hair I decided to give black malva a try</li>
            <li> (I have long, thick hair that is dyed dark brown.)  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t worried about the mess since I am used to dying my hair with permanent dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate red tint in my hair, and this is the only thing that gets rid of it almost completely.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether or not it works as a conditioner, but be advised it is for dark hair!</li>
            <li> This product turned my hair green.</li>
            <li> and once I rinsed it out and my hair dried, you couldn&#x27;t see any sign of warmth in my hair and</li>
            <li> It turned all of my highlights green.  </li>
            <li> After washing it twice a day for two weeks, some of the green was still in my hair</li>
            <li> This noticeably tinted my brown hair green.</li>

            <li> For the expensive price, unappealing scent and lack of results, I would not personally purchase this product again, nor do I recommend it.</li>
            <li> dying to cover grey had left my hair with a fake brassy tone that would come back no matter what haircolor i used, weeks before roots need covering, the brass tones would be terrible.</li>
            <li> , I am disappointed as I purchased this to darken my slowly graying hair and it has not helped that even a little bit.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this. i dyed my hair from brown to black and this maintains the color really well. it does have a strong herbal smell, but the color pay off is great.</li>
            <li> for those of you who do not want the \\&quot;boot black\\&quot; look of a permanent dye and to take the red out of dark hair - terrific</li>
            <li> The product was delivery on time no problem w/ seller.  I would not recomend this product  I got several handfull of hair while rinse this off my head.  Scary ... $25 in the trash can.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this conditioner! After a horrid highlight job (not Aveda) and several attempted corrections, I had resigned myself to brassy orange hair (or hats) for several years until grown out. Then I came across reviews for Aveda products and thought, \\&quot;that&#x27;s a lot of $, but people say it works,\\&quot; so... here I am two weeks later with nary a touch of brass and GLORIOUS brown hair returned! An added bonus: the roots blend, so I don&#x27;t have a grow-out line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use clove shampoo, followed by conditioning with a half-black malva, half-clove (to and add lighter brown tones) blend. I leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes (the first time I used it, I left it on for 20min, fyi) before a quick rinse. My hair feels a bit stripped after the shampoo (and it rinses out some of the previous days color), but after conditioning my hair is super soft and silky, with amazing shine! It is definitely worth the extra $ to have a product that delivers such beautiful results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does stain, but isn&#x27;t that the point?!  If you give a quick scrub with soap followed by a rinse, this is not a problem.  My hair is a medium ashy brown, which is why I lean towards the clove products and then add the black malva.  On light hair I&#x27;d mix the teeniest bit with another conditioner before trying this straight.  It is dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine on Aveda&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> If you want to take the natural light tones out of your hair, this is the way to do it!  It works perfectly to darken up your hair.  It will stain your hands, but it goes away the next day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, i wouldnt say it drastically changes the colour of your hair, but in the sun, my black hair used to look a bit brownish, but now it looks totally black!! the only thing is it says to leave it on for 2-5 mins, but what you should do is step out of the shower and leave it on for 20 minutes. also, it smells a bit, but the smell doesnt stay long at all. and you have to put a lot.  note however, that i dont use it as a daily conditioner, but use it every week for 20 mins.  its AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I am a brunette with medium highlights. This product turned my hair green. I now mix with Clove and it looks great.</li>
            <li> In the past , I&#x27;ve used Jason Malva shampoo to keep my hair black until they discontinued it. My hair is relaxed so I prefer to use more natural products to keep them strong and healthy; they tend to turn brown or red. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I love the darker shade. I am really pleased with this conditionner because it also leaves my hair soft and moisturized, my hair looks  like I had gone to the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that when colored chocolate goes brassy eventually. With the help of this conditioner I can tone that brassy down. I once even applied it and left it on for 40 minutes when the stylist did my hair too light once, it came out purplish brown, but at least it wasn&#x27;t brassy! The only thing is that this stuff STAINS like crazy. It stains your hands, your forehead, your shower tiles, tub and curtain. You get the picture. I recommend applying this, outside the shower onto dry hair first using some of those plastic gloves, and then get in and rinse it off when you&#x27;re ready. Basically treat it as you would that hair dye in the box from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Darkens my hair as it says it will do.  I leave it in for 20 minutes, and do it twice a week. My salt and pepper hair is darker, but doesn&#x27;t look colored.</li>
            <li> I have tried this so many ways and I still cannot ever tell I have used it. I have applied it to dry hair and left it on for an hour before rinsing it out. I have washed my hair dried it and applied the black malva conditioner and left it on for an hour. I have applied it to wet hair (after washing).&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has made my hair any darker at all. It does help with removing red hints in my dark brown hair but does not darken my hair at all. I also do like they feel of my hair after using it so that is why I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am disappointed as I purchased this to darken my slowly graying hair and it has not helped that even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I bought it for mom. She usually allergics chemicals in the shampoo and conditioner but this one is allergic free. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My hair is a medium reddish brown naturally, and this tends to turn it a slightly ashier-colored version of reddish brown.&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 5 stars because that&#x27;s what it says on the bottle.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot anyway and see how it turned out.</li>
            <li> Love this! I hate red tint in my hair, and this is the only thing that gets rid of it almost completely.</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to go red in the sun. This product is great! It&#x27;s natural, leaves my hair super shiny , and best of all, covers the red. I&#x27;ve tried henna before, but it is hard to wash out the excess, and it ends up on towels and pillowcases. This product does not. It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;ll order it again. The service was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveda Black Malva shampoo and conditioner for years.  Recently, the conditioner turned my hair blue with permanent blue streaks.  I called Aveda customer service. They were very unsympathetic to me, told me that I could buy their clarifying shampoo to try to help remove the blue streaks.  They also said i could return the products I had not used, if there was more than 50% left and if I still had the receipts.  And i would have to pay shipping myself.  Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in their customer service, for a very loyal customer who had bought their expensive products not only for myself but for my family for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Toned down the reddish/gold tones in my medium brown hair, giving it a more ashy tone. Left it on for about 2 minutes. Can stain, but just rinse hands and tub right away and that seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for over 10 years and it continued to deliver! Great &#x27; touch up&#x27; in between color for grey hair. The shine and moisture rock! If we could only get ridif the messy hand stain after applying sans gloves. I just find gloves annoying.</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair in the brown to dark blonde range and brass is a problem, this product could be your answer. dying to cover grey had left my hair with a fake brassy tone that would come back no matter what haircolor i used, weeks before roots need covering, the brass tones would be terrible. This conditioner was a miraculous improvement for my hair tone. It still would have some coppery highlights in the full sun, which i wish were not there, but indoor lighting the color was perfect. I have some highlights, but they are only about level 6-7 and no issues with them turning green. I use this conditioner daily. Yes it will tint your palms, but washes off, same thing with sink or shower, don&#x27;t let spots sit and should be no staining. It also has nice conditioning properties, leaving my hair feeling fuller and soft, but it does not have alot of slip. My hair is fine textured, so too much slip can make it look flat anyway.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want, makes my over-dyed hair return to its natural cool-tones. I&#x27;ve used it for months now and I cant live without it. Has made my hair so much healthier and smells really nice. So worth the money.</li>
            <li> I color my hair dark ash brown and nothing is more annoying than when my color fades into a bronze tone, which happens pretty easily when I go out in the sun a lot.  This conditioner is a little bit messy( you have to be careful not to get any on painted surfaces or white plastic shower fixtures, because it will stain), but it works like gangbusters.  Be sure to read the instructions and leave the conditioner on your hair for the recommended time to get the full benefit.  Also, rinse your hands quickly after you put the product in your hair because it will temporarily stain them purple.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with this product. I wish it had dyed my hair half as much as it dyed my shower and tile. At the very least, it smelled nice and was a nice, thick texture which made application easy.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible hair dye experience that ruined some parts of my hair cuticle and made it unable to take color, I was stuck with the warmest shade of brown hair you can imagine. (Which looked horrid on me because I have such a warm skin tone it looked unbalanced) After hours of researching and looking for tinted shampoos/conditioners that might help I came across this and decided to give it a try... WOW!! I left this on my hair for about 15 minutes and once I rinsed it out and my hair dried, you couldn&#x27;t see any sign of warmth in my hair and my hair was a dark brown the way I like it!! This is my Holy Grail conditioner and I would recommend this to anyone looking to eliminate warm tones or darken your hair!!! Such an amazing hair product I can&#x27;t say enough great things!!! :)</li>
            <li> I used Sun In for my dark brown hair even though it wasn&#x27;t recommended on the product instructions. I got a lighter,shiny but slightly reddish orange tint to my hair. After doing some research I decided to try the Alveda Black Melva shampoo and conditioner. It was amazing! after washing and conditioning one time my brown hair color was back to normal with a little extra shine. The only drawback is if you have light blonde or gray hair it ends up with a barely noticeable  bluish color to it. My hair has very little gray so that isn&#x27;t a big problem for me. I just washed that streak with regular shampoo a couple of times to remove the blue. I am so happy to have my normal color back.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is the part that actually deposits the color.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a medium brown with both ash and coppery tones. Black Malva deepened the colour and depending on how frequently I use it and how long I leave it on, I can get anywhere from a deep cool brown to just a deeper richer colour than my own. The only catch for me was that the very ends of my hair were brutalized by a bad salon bleach job, so there wasn&#x27;t really any red remaining in some straw like strands. Those strands soaked up all the blackest of the colour, and then the REALLY damaged bits (just a few wisps at the ends) grabbed only the greenish/bluish hues. If you have very porous or damaged hair, especially if it is light and lacking red pigments, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. But for anyone with dark to medium brown hair, it&#x27;s great for deepening your hair colour, giving it a nice rich look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month along with the shampoo and have made sure to condition for at least 15 minutes during each use. I have not noticed any difference in color darkness, but I have started to notice my gray hairs, so who knows what that means. For the expensive price, unappealing scent and lack of results, I would not personally purchase this product again, nor do I recommend it. On the positive side it does a good job of softening hair without making it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I have medium lenght dark brown hair. It is normally shiny, soft, with very few grey hair . I thought this product would give my hair a nice deeper darker shade and even more shine. After I have used Aveda Black Malva conditioner, my hair is not shiny anymore and it gets greasy after only 2 days. This product will go in the trash very soon; that&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years and recently had my blonde hair dyed black. Although the dye was permanent it began to wash off after 2 days and by 2 weeks I had medium brown hair. Instead of redying my hair I decided to give black malva a try and it worked! I was amazed by how dark it made my hair after one hour. Be aware, however, that if you had blonde hair before black it will leave hair with a greenish tone.</li>
            <li> This works but it leaves my hair a little dry after.  I use a conditioning mask before and after most times I use it.  It does not last more that two washes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I have light brown hair that gets a little ashy if I don&#x27;t do anything to it. But every time I dyed it, no matter how neutral or cool of a color I used it would ALWAYS turn reddish.  I hated it.  All I wanted was some rich, chocolate brown hair.  Well, I finally got it with this product.  First try I left it in for about 5 minutes... And I haven&#x27;t seen any red since.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so I only need to use this product about once a week.  Even after it washes out, my hair really isn&#x27;t reddish anymore. And, I haven&#x27;t needed to dye my hair in a long time since this keeps the ashiness at bay. Awesome. Nice side benefit is that my guy loves how my hair smells after I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use the conditioner, I don&#x27;t have the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, I got it quick, and your price was the best I&#x27;ve found yet. I no longer buy it locally I buy it always from you, thanks on this one amazon! Good job!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the shipping couldn&#x27;t have been better !  Great experience all the way around &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> At full disclosure, I&#x27;ll say I didn&#x27;t read the back of the bottle before applying.  I have brown hair with some warm highlights and my hair had become very dry so I&#x27;ll thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner.  It turned all of my highlights green.  After washing it twice a day for two weeks, some of the green was still in my hair and I finally had to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether or not it works as a conditioner, but be advised it is for dark hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product feeling confident that it would, if nothing else, smell nice and perhaps make the faded bits of my hair color a little more even.  I bought it to *try* to cover or lessen my very white roots.  I understand that this product is not meant to cover gray, but based on some of the reviews it seemed like it was worth a shot.  I wasn&#x27;t worried about the mess since I am used to dying my hair with permanent dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put this product on my hair I was struck by the unpleasant aroma.  It is herbal, but in a very medicine-y way.  It reminds me of some of those tinctures that chinese herbalists prescribe - they can be very pungent and unpleasant.  It kind of grossed me out, but I applied the product liberally to my roots and worked it through the rest of my hair as best I could. (I have long, thick hair that is dyed dark brown.)  I left the product on for about 30 minutes since many reviewers said to leave it on longer for darker coverage - it also says this on the bottle.  The whole time the smell was nauseating me, but I tried to ignore it.  I am shocked that so many people say that it has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed it out, the smell lingered in my hair.  I was hoping it would not... shortly after rinsing it out, I actually vomited from the smell.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  Not only that, after it was dry, there was NO DIFFERENCE in my hair color.  It did not affect my white roots at all and the rest of my hair looked exactly the same as it had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I do not recommend this product at all.  I am used to dying my hair so I can deal with strong smells, but this stuff was horrible and it did nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t even really condition your hair!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was perfect for my needs. I have very dark brown, almost black hair, and I recently had some highlights done. Over time, the highlights became brassy and dull. I used this conditioner to cover up the highlights, and it worked perfectly! It looks like I had overall color done, but without the cost and additional damage to my hair. :)</li>
            <li> This noticeably tinted my brown hair green.</li>
            <li> I had a miserable brassy orange undertone to my brown, oxidized and damaged hair. It looked terrible. I am an ash brown naturally, so I have been looking to restore that without using peroxide and further damaging the hair. THANK GOD I FOUND THIS! After leaving it in for an hour (to be sure), ALL the hideous orange is gone and my hair looks incredibly healthy and fabulous. I love, love, love this product. It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s better than using toner, or repeatedly using a semi permanent dye every four weeks. Love the herbal scent, too!</li>
            <li> This definitely makes my dark brown hair closer to black!  However, it does dry my hair out a tiny bit.  I have found that a little extra conditioning and using a nice oil (argan, coconut, etc) will help combat this.  I love that it tones down the red tones in my hair and makes it a cooler color.  I will keep this on hand when I can (it is expensive to use all the time).</li>
            <li> Definitely notice that it keeps my hair darker for a longer period of time. I plan on getting this again once this one runs out!</li>
            <li> All this product does is add a stain until the next hair wash. Too much? It will change your hair color. It also will stain your shower stall unless rinsed out immediately. May be good if you have black hair, to help cover some grey. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to be caught in a rainstorm without an umbrella with this is my hair. You may just end up looking like a zebra. Zebra&#x27;s are cute, but not necessarily the new fashion statement for a human. Bottom line, find another product.</li>
            <li> Great for getting rid of brassy/red tones. Smells nice. Conditions well, adds depth &amp; shine. Lasts a long time because you only need to use a couple times a week.  I even have purple streaks in my hair &amp; when they fade &amp; start looking kinda pinkish/purple and washed out, this brings them back to a deep rich purple without making them look black or brown.</li>
            <li> Love Aveda Black Malva conditioner. It keeps my hair as black as the first day by depositing subtle color and gives it shine. I gave it four stars because it also deposits a bit of color on your hands and specially your nails if you don&#x27;t have nail polish. So you end up with &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; looking fingernails even if you wash them often.</li>
            <li> A little does NOT go a long way. Went through the product very fast. The conditioner stained my hands as well. It worked but washed out (not a permanent fix) and ultimately not worth the money</li>
            <li> I treated this like hair dye, and then it fades on the same rate as hair dye does. I leave it on for 40 minutes before showering. It definitely packs a punch of color as it is highly pigmented. I never had issue with this staining anything in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how smooth and conditioning this is as well. It definitely saves money in the long run. I wish I used the Blue Malva as a toner instead of toner when I went blonde. Would&#x27;ve been just as good. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yah, definitely recommend!</li>
