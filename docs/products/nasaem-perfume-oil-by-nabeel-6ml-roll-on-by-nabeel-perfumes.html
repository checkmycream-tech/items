            <li> All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  However, I thought  this one was more unisex and I wanted something more definitely feminine even though I usually choose slightly masculine fragrances.  These oils bloom on the skin over an extended period so you must wait some time to decide whether you like it.</li>
            <li> Smells so delicious!! Lightening fast delivery!! Will be returning for more!</li>
            <li> Very floral with a lot of high notes!  But, so nice after it settles upon the skin.  Most suited for a woman.</li>
            <li> When I seen this bottle of perfume oil, I just knew it would smell good. Boy was I right! You do not need a lot of it and when you apply it in the right pulse points, it will get you alot of complments, which I wasnt expecting, because just when you can not smell it much anymore, someone else can! That is the &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; of this Nabeel Perfume Oil. They have a whole line of nice oils and you can read what goes in each, that is how I came to try this one. Now I have four and counting. Thank you, a very satisfied customer, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived today (VERY fast shipping!) and I can&#x27;t wait to try out this scent!  Love the affordability, the quality of these oils, and look forward to growing my collection of them!</li>
            <li> Oud (wood) and incense! A woody floral incense is what this smells like! Its smells clean smells exactly like the oudh wood incense chips by the same brand &amp;#34;Nabeel&amp;#34; also smell patchouli in it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice but for an acquired taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its longevity depends on the persons skin with most scents be them parfum,oil or EDT this has great longevity and isnt over powering just dont over do it you dont want to smell like incense with legs(or maybe you do?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah..... Oud/wood floral incense and patchouli hint of musk!</li>
            <li> initially thought I would not be able to wear.  then put it on and let is sit with me all day and grew to love it.  then added it on top of Dalal.  oh my goodness.  it is soooo appealing and receive sooo many compliments from both female and male.  is now, the combined two, my second favorite scent from this brand.  love these.... roses is heavenly... soft is fun for a change.  price is great and they last.  so glad to have discovered.  I now wear these scents exclusively.  in love with these</li>
            <li> I have the body spray by nasaem and it&#x27;s great good smell and last all day I saw that they have the oil, so I got it and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Not what I really expected in olfactory arena.  I have smelt some really nice arabic type perfumes/oils but this one is not a fragrance I would order again.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely divine. Oriental, woody with a citrus touch in top and middle note. Perfect for occasions. Excellent perfume.</li>
            <li> first trying a indian oil,i find it pleasant</li>
            <li> THIS BRAND IS TERRIBLE IN EVERY FLAVOR I BOUGHT. WHEN THE AIR HITS THE PRODUCT IT TURNS GROSS. RUBBING ALCOHOL TO GET STINK OFf</li>
            <li> LOTS of rose at first but then dries down to a lovely, soft floral that lasts quite long on me. Sillage is good but once dry is only a skin scent.</li>
            <li> Sweet, spicy, strong, interesting. It is a unique scent that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is somewhat of an acquired taste and also has many complicated notes that can smell different depending on the body chemistry. I wouldn&#x27;t call this one universally appealing but it is definitely my style. At this price it is worth the risk if you are buying this blind. Someone you know will like it if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> May be somebody will like it  but for me it is kind of soap fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells nice doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> gross, not for ladies.</li>
