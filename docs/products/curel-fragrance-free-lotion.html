            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but it was kind of waxy.</li>
            <li>I like the product and it was handy to be able to order it instead of searching for it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I needed a low-oil type lotion and have sensitive skin, This is perfect for me</li>
            <li>Soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky or oily as so many creams do.  </li>
            <li>Any Curel product is great, but this fragrance free is simply the best.  </li>

            <li>What else is there to say, fragrance free, non greasy, goes on smooth and is great for use all year</li>
            <li>very cheap compare to the dept stores</li>
            <li>Curel is the best lotion I have ever used and is the only one I will buy!</li>
            <li>Curel is my favorite skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>bought this for my grandparents and they love it.</li>
            <li>so you would use their product more often.</li>
            <li>But it is better than nothing</li>
            <li>and if I can&#x27;t find anything I like better I will continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>(hint) put in on after your shower or bath as your skin is up to 100x more absorbent at that time....</li>
            <li>I have allergies so most &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; items still cause some reaction however this lotion does not have that effect.</li>
            <li>, I like this formula much better.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
            <li>im very happy with this lotion overall.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands so many times in a day I need a lotion like this.</li>
            <li>They changed the formula and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li>I have tried many comparable brands without the results I get from Curel.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for use on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li>My wife enjoys this lotion, but I love it.</li>
            <li>With my allergies and my wife&#x27;s love of coating herself nightly in lotion, bedtime often turned into a race to the rescue inhaler.</li>
            <li>I wanted a lotion that would help keep my hands moisturized without having the overpowering smell that many fragranced lotions do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like scents in most lotions.  </li>
            <li>And it has shea butter. :)</li>
            <li>Fragrance free is the only type I can use, and this brand is the one I like the best.</li>
            <li>This is a very good overall lotion for the family.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is a great option for lotion that will not irritate yours skin.</li>
            <li>This CUREL is so much better than any fragrance free lotion we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion, I had heard it was good</li>
            <li>Plant-based and other wise!!  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and this lotion is awesome!  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you need something that is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>its fragrance free which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I appreciate this fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I used a Nutrogena fragrance free lotion for years.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky, absorbs well, no fragrance or odors and keeps you moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It works well and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Light weight like a lotion but moisturizes like a cream.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the fragrance free...not a hint of smell.</li>
            <li>product does not bother me, it is the first time I can say that about anything!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, yet not greasy, so I&#x27;m able to use in the hot summer months as well.</li>
            <li>they love how it makes their skin so smooth without the fragrance that other lotions try to put in their lotion to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This works all right and is fragrance free and does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Curel is the one of the few good quality, inexpensive, fragrance free lotions available.</li>
            <li>We discovered that fragrance free does not mean odor free.</li>
            <li>This bottle is larger than what I&#x27;ve found in stores and this is a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t use it on the face or areas that are very sensitive otherwise I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not scentless (it has a very subtle &#x27;clean&#x27; smell a bit like soap) but since there are no added fragrances it&#x27;s perfect for someone allergic to fragrance, or a man who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or fruit.</li>
            <li>Since she has started using the Curel Fragrance Free lotion, I am breathing much easier.</li>
            <li>And the stated fact that it is fragrance free is thankfully very true and necessary for me.  </li>
            <li>I stop using it right after the first try.</li>
            <li>This Curel lotion massages into the skin and with daily use keeps my skin smooth and irritation free without leaving any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I actually used it on my face when I was younger and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion, only one I use, as I am allergic to fragrance!</li>
            <li>This product is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my face at first, but after a couple of uses I beginning to see the side-effects.</li>
            <li>It comforts and replenishes exactly as it states.  </li>
            <li>it makes me feel all soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Finally I found a REAL no-fragrance lotion!!!!</li>
            <li>I buy it from my local grocery/drug store, I just love it so much</li>
            <li>Many fragrances irritate my skin which also happens to be quite dry in the fall/winter.</li>
            <li>This soaks in quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>I love Curel and usually I cannot buy the fragrance free in my drugstore.</li>
            <li>Their maximum strength sensitive skin remedy comes in a tube and is a little thicker but perfect for anyone who washes their hands often and has dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li>It is not a sun block, but as you get older your skin appreciates an emollient!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for an overall moisturizing lotion, but it&#x27;s not going to meet the ideals of those really suffering with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this exact product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>so it drys out really fast</li>
            <li>It really is comforting to skin.</li>
            <li>It has all the traits that you want in a lotion for acne-prone skin: Fragrance free (which is different from unscented), &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;, non-comodogenic, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can really layer it on without feeling like I&#x27;m clogging anything up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this lotion, but I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free is the key here.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the miracle.</li>
            <li>This form is indeed fragrance free and very gentle for sensitive skin, definitely getting the job done.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and helps a lot to keep dry skin under control.</li>
            <li>Many other lotions smelled like chemicals or even herbs.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>And a whole new batch of cystic acne formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need a fragrance free lotion and have fairly dry skin as I am an older person.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any oil in it either, most lotions have mineral oil or petrolatum, both of which are actually not organic and do not absorb but instead get wiped onto whatever you touch next.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every single lotion available in a drugstore and they are all either not moisturizing, oily, or make me itch.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed pretty quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about not touching anything.  </li>
            <li>I put some olive oil in it and it works a little better that way.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased shea, mango, cocoa butters and other natural, organic oils to make my own products.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so this does not irritate.</li>
            <li>you are prone to body acne, stay clear of this lotion!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hands soft!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It is wondeful to have a lotion that works at a superior level for my dry and sensitive skin without having to go into extra strength forms or other nonsense.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely mild on your skin and not very greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that the Curel lotion moisturizes well and leave my skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion as I have hives and frequent allergic skin reactions.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to everything including fragrance mix and propylene glycol.....</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>and I swear it is what is keeping my skin soft and young.</li>
            <li>My young children with sensitive skin do not have problems.  </li>
            <li>For a sensitive skin lotion promoting health, it has ingredients known to cause cancer.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;ve tried all the different brands and haven&#x27;t found what works for you I highly recommend Curel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion, especially if you can&#x27;t handle scent from lotion.</li>
            <li>this lotion is not irritating to my overly dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much mony on lotions and always regreted the purchase until I got this lotion from amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is super moisturizing, sinks in quite fast, not the least bit oily, and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve extremely dry and sensitive skin on my face.</li>

            <li> It has all the traits that you want in a lotion for acne-prone skin: Fragrance free (which is different from unscented), &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;, non-comodogenic, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can really layer it on without feeling like I&#x27;m clogging anything up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lotion, but I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free is the key here.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the miracle.</li>
            <li> This form is indeed fragrance free and very gentle for sensitive skin, definitely getting the job done.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and helps a lot to keep dry skin under control.</li>
            <li> Many other lotions smelled like chemicals or even herbs.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> And a whole new batch of cystic acne formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a fragrance free lotion and have fairly dry skin as I am an older person.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any oil in it either, most lotions have mineral oil or petrolatum, both of which are actually not organic and do not absorb but instead get wiped onto whatever you touch next.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every single lotion available in a drugstore and they are all either not moisturizing, oily, or make me itch.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed pretty quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about not touching anything.  </li>
            <li> I put some olive oil in it and it works a little better that way.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased shea, mango, cocoa butters and other natural, organic oils to make my own products.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so this does not irritate.</li>
            <li> you are prone to body acne, stay clear of this lotion!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands soft!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It is wondeful to have a lotion that works at a superior level for my dry and sensitive skin without having to go into extra strength forms or other nonsense.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely mild on your skin and not very greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> and I have found that the Curel lotion moisturizes well and leave my skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion as I have hives and frequent allergic skin reactions.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to everything including fragrance mix and propylene glycol.....</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> and I swear it is what is keeping my skin soft and young.</li>
            <li> My young children with sensitive skin do not have problems.  </li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin lotion promoting health, it has ingredients known to cause cancer.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve tried all the different brands and haven&#x27;t found what works for you I highly recommend Curel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion, especially if you can&#x27;t handle scent from lotion.</li>
            <li> this lotion is not irritating to my overly dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much mony on lotions and always regreted the purchase until I got this lotion from amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is super moisturizing, sinks in quite fast, not the least bit oily, and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve extremely dry and sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Any type of frangrance becomes an irritant for me due to my sensitive allergies.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this product is very hard to moisturize my skin because it absorbs so fast, after a few days my face starts feeling red, scaly and stingy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisturization does not last very long, either.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on my body as well as my face and it is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any sort of negative skin reaction.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and actually moisturizes my skin which almost hurts when dry.  </li>
            <li> I constantly try other products because I would like to find one that does not contain paragons.</li>
            <li> I have quite dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and nothing has worked ever.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry skin</li>
            <li> I put some on my neck, back, and shoulders each morning and it is fully soaked in and dry in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The list goes on and on, but this is the only product I can use without a greasy residue or a dry, itchy sensation after a few minutes of applying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The various treatments I was using dried my skin</li>
            <li> We did our research too and spent over $100 trying other products.</li>
            <li> Other lotions sting when they&#x27;re like that, but not this.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry year round and extremely dry and raw in the winter.  </li>
            <li> but at least I finally found a lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion every single day for the past 12 years.</li>
            <li> for them it worked wonders on their dried hands.</li>
            <li> I like the Curel lotions and have used them for a few years.  </li>
            <li> but I already have a year round face moisturizer I rely on.  </li>
            <li> I am still looking for a shampoo and conditioner and a soap to use everyday...</li>
            <li> Tried other brands that are expensive and for wrinkles, well went back to Cure&#x27;l,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have recently discovered this lotion has parabens in it and will not be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li> Specifically this helps the dryness of the lower legs mostly common even at 40..</li>
            <li> It is no too thick, greasy, or oily.</li>
            <li> (bad enough for Accutane).  </li>
            <li> My hands get sad and raw in the winter.  </li>
            <li> the worst one I have had so far.</li>
            <li> (Sorry about the pun!)</li>
            <li> I tried their Itch-Defense formula and found it to be sticky and slightly unpleasant</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion years ago when my acne got bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this lotion is too greasy. the worst one I have had so far. I stop using it right after the first try. it&#x27;s sticky</li>
            <li> The curel arrived on time which was good. Curel is the best lotion I have ever used and is the only one I will buy!</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion, only one I use, as I am allergic to fragrance! Keeps my hands soft!</li>
            <li> What else is there to say, fragrance free, non greasy, goes on smooth and is great for use all year</li>
            <li> Curel is my favorite skin moisturizer. Fragrance free is the only type I can use, and this brand is the one I like the best.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it was handy to be able to order it instead of searching for it in the stores.</li>
            <li> bought this for my grandparents and they love it. they love how it makes their skin so smooth without the fragrance that other lotions try to put in their lotion to make it smell good. for them it worked wonders on their dried hands.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I needed a low-oil type lotion and have sensitive skin, This is perfect for me</li>
            <li> This is the  best hand lotion out there. It isn&#x27;t greasy and yet it still feels like it did something after it dries.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the product I was looking for. I&#x27;ve extremely dry and sensitive skin on my face. This product is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my face at first, but after a couple of uses I beginning to see the side-effects. First of all, this product is very hard to moisturize my skin because it absorbs so fast, after a few days my face starts feeling red, scaly and stingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I assume they added ingredients in there so it drys out really fast so you would use their product more often. It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t use it on the face or areas that are very sensitive otherwise I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so this does not irritate. It is not greasy and it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the Curel lotions and have used them for a few years.  I have eczema and very dry skin and I have found that the Curel lotion moisturizes well and leave my skin feeling soft and supple.  Unfortunately, I have recently discovered this lotion has parabens in it and will not be purchasing again.  I recently purchased shea, mango, cocoa butters and other natural, organic oils to make my own products.</li>
            <li> Many fragrances irritate my skin which also happens to be quite dry in the fall/winter. Curel&#x27;s fragrance free lotion is the perfect product for me. The lotion itself is quality and keeps my skin hydrated all day. It is no too thick, greasy, or oily. In fact, it is the quickest to soak in of any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I put some on my neck, back, and shoulders each morning and it is fully soaked in and dry in just a few minutes. The lotion is not scentless (it has a very subtle &#x27;clean&#x27; smell a bit like soap) but since there are no added fragrances it&#x27;s perfect for someone allergic to fragrance, or a man who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or fruit. I fall into both categories.</li>
            <li> this lotion is not irritating to my overly dry, sensitive skin.  it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> very cheap compare to the dept stores</li>
            <li> It took me years going through various brands of lotions to find one that actually worked for me.  My skin is dry year round and extremely dry and raw in the winter.  Curel is the only one that works for me.  It is wondeful to have a lotion that works at a superior level for my dry and sensitive skin without having to go into extra strength forms or other nonsense.  And the stated fact that it is fragrance free is thankfully very true and necessary for me.  Any type of frangrance becomes an irritant for me due to my sensitive allergies.  This Curel lotion massages into the skin and with daily use keeps my skin smooth and irritation free without leaving any greasy residue.  It does what a lotion should.  It comforts and replenishes exactly as it states.  I only use this lotion on my hands, feet and body but not my face.  This is not because it didn&#x27;t work on my face but I already have a year round face moisturizer I rely on.  So if you&#x27;ve tried all the different brands and haven&#x27;t found what works for you I highly recommend Curel.  This form is indeed fragrance free and very gentle for sensitive skin, definitely getting the job done.  It&#x27;s a must for me.</li>
            <li> I need a fragrance free lotion and have fairly dry skin as I am an older person.  This works all right and is fragrance free and does not make me break out.  It does not moisturize as well as I would like, but maybe nothing will for someone my age.  The moisturization does not last very long, either.  But it is better than nothing and if I can&#x27;t find anything I like better I will continue to purchase it.  I recommend it if you need something that is fragrance free.  I put some olive oil in it and it works a little better that way.</li>
            <li> I have a medical background and an Scottish/Irish background. For the price you can lather this on your skin without worries of allergies. Scentless is a plus all around. It is not a sun block, but as you get older your skin appreciates an emollient! (hint) put in on after your shower or bath as your skin is up to 100x more absorbent at that time....Specifically this helps the dryness of the lower legs mostly common even at 40..</li>
            <li> I have quite dry skin. I use this lotion to moisturize my hands. It is absorbed quickly and helps a lot to keep dry skin under control.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is a great option for lotion that will not irritate yours skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and feel that it&#x27;s one of the best lotions available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion every single day for the past 12 years. I can use it on my body as well as my face and it is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any sort of negative skin reaction. In addition, I have severe eczema so you can imagine I&#x27;ve used several products on the market (cetaphil, aveeno, eucerin, lubriderm, vas aline, etc.) The list goes on and on, but this is the only product I can use without a greasy residue or a dry, itchy sensation after a few minutes of applying it. It really is comforting to skin. I also use it with steroid cream for my hands and it does not react with the steroid cream. I would recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin. I would also recommend it to people who have babies. Some of the products for babies have powder scents. I haven&#x27;t even purchased this product on Amazon before. I buy it from my local grocery/drug store, I just love it so much I thought I&#x27;d write a review.</li>
            <li> Curel is the one of the few good quality, inexpensive, fragrance free lotions available.</li>
            <li> My new favorite lotion, I had heard it was good but this is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t have any oil in it either, most lotions have mineral oil or petrolatum, both of which are actually not organic and do not absorb but instead get wiped onto whatever you touch next.  I have allergies so most &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; items still cause some reaction however this lotion does not have that effect.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion as I have hives and frequent allergic skin reactions.  I&#x27;m very happy with it, it does seem to sooth my skin and doesn&#x27;t flair anything up.  I tried their Itch-Defense formula and found it to be sticky and slightly unpleasant, I like this formula much better.  Soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky or oily as so many creams do.  I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion years ago when my acne got bad (bad enough for Accutane).  It has all the traits that you want in a lotion for acne-prone skin: Fragrance free (which is different from unscented), &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;, non-comodogenic, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various treatments I was using dried my skin something fierce.  This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  It is extremely mild on your skin and not very greasy at all.  I can really layer it on without feeling like I&#x27;m clogging anything up.  It gets absorbed pretty quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about not touching anything.  I use it on my face as well as my hands.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lotion. (Sorry about the pun!) The unscented is truly just that.  This soaks in quickly and completely.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but is very moisturizing.  My skin feels hydrated, not like it&#x27;s coated in lotion.  My hands get sad and raw in the winter.  Other lotions sting when they&#x27;re like that, but not this.  I actually used it on my face when I was younger and it worked great.  This bottle is larger than what I&#x27;ve found in stores and this is a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> im very happy with this lotion overall. its fragrance free which is fantastic. and its a great moisturizer. it makes me feel all soft and smooth. and when i apply to my face it doesnt leave me all greasy and/or shiny as some lotions do.</li>
            <li> I do, and will continue to, use Curel daily.  I have issues with scented lotions so I appreciate this fragrance free lotion.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and actually moisturizes my skin which almost hurts when dry.  I wash my hands so many times in a day I need a lotion like this.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and after washing up in the kitchen and there is one at my desk. My entire family could not get by without it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to EVERYTHING!!  Plant-based and other wise!!  I am sensitive to everything including fragrance mix and propylene glycol..... I need to be studied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not bother me, it is the first time I can say that about anything!!  I am still looking for a shampoo and conditioner and a soap to use everyday... but at least I finally found a lotion!</li>
            <li> Finally I found a REAL no-fragrance lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I used a Nutrogena fragrance free lotion for years. They changed the formula and I&#x27;m glad they did. This CUREL is so much better than any fragrance free lotion we&#x27;ve found. We did our research too and spent over $100 trying other products. We discovered that fragrance free does not mean odor free. Many other lotions smelled like chemicals or even herbs. We were so relieved and happy to discover CUREL. It goes on smooth and silky, absorbs well, no fragrance or odors and keeps you moisturized without feeling greasy. Their maximum strength sensitive skin remedy comes in a tube and is a little thicker but perfect for anyone who washes their hands often and has dry hands and cuticles. LOVE CUREL!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is unscented and absorbs well.  I have been using it for many years and it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I both use it. It is not greasy. We use it for total body protection. WE recommend it also!</li>
            <li> Been using Curel for years because it works well for my skin type.  I constantly try other products because I would like to find one that does not contain paragons.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for dry, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried every single lotion available in a drugstore and they are all either not moisturizing, oily, or make me itch. This is super moisturizing, sinks in quite fast, not the least bit oily, and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a senior citizen and it was as neutral in scent and healing as we could get for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have OCD and wash my hands alot, been to doctors and gave me creams, non worked then my husband came home with Cure&#x27;l , this was 20 years ago. WOW! Within a week my hands were cleared up. I use it several times a day and every night before bed. My hands look like I am 30, but I am over 50. So soft. I also think that is why people mistake me for being around 38 , 40, I have been using it on my face for 20 years and I swear it is what is keeping my skin soft and young. Tried other brands that are expensive and for wrinkles, well went back to Cure&#x27;l,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lotion, but I couldn&#x27;t. It does get three stars for the fact that your skin stays moisturized for days after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is greasy - which I can&#x27;t stand. I am prone to body acne when I am using a product that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;agree\\&quot; with my skin. This is one of those products. I used this lotion for several days, and noticed cystic acne forming on the areas I used it (note - I did not use this lotion on my face, so I can&#x27;t comment on how great it is for that). I discontinued use, and started using it again after the acne spots subsided... And a whole new batch of cystic acne formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to body acne, stay clear of this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion was bought for me to help in the process of my healing tattoo over the summer. I needed an unscented lotion for the healing process. This lotion did the trick but it was kind of waxy. And it contains parabens just a warning to anyone who cares about that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free is the key here. I love Curel and usually I cannot buy the fragrance free in my drugstore.</li>
            <li> A cream that actually moisturizes and is not greasy. I have tried many comparable brands without the results I get from Curel.</li>
            <li> This is a very good overall lotion for the family.  It works well and is fragrance free.  My young children with sensitive skin do not have problems.  It&#x27;s a good value for an overall moisturizing lotion, but it&#x27;s not going to meet the ideals of those really suffering with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for use on my face after shaving. It is very gentle and keeps my skin moisturized all day. I will be buying this exact product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin lotion promoting health, it has ingredients known to cause cancer.  Otherwise, it was hydrating and didn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys this lotion, but I love it. With my allergies and my wife&#x27;s love of coating herself nightly in lotion, bedtime often turned into a race to the rescue inhaler. Since she has started using the Curel Fragrance Free lotion, I am breathing much easier.</li>
            <li> Any Curel product is great, but this fragrance free is simply the best.  I don&#x27;t like mixing scents, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and nothing has worked ever.  I have spent so much mony on lotions and always regreted the purchase until I got this lotion from amazon.  Curel is the best.  It works!!!  It lasts!!! and I will always use it.  Thanks for the miracle.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and this lotion is awesome!  Light weight like a lotion but moisturizes like a cream.  Love it!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for great unscented lotion, this is for you. Great product.  I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well and no smell! I wanted a lotion that would help keep my hands moisturized without having the overpowering smell that many fragranced lotions do. This one did the trick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like scents in most lotions.  This is perfect one for me.  I highly recommend this lotion, especially if you can&#x27;t handle scent from lotion.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive and oily skin. It&#x27;s moisturizing, yet not greasy, so I&#x27;m able to use in the hot summer months as well. I enjoy the fragrance free...not a hint of smell. And it has shea butter. :)</li>
