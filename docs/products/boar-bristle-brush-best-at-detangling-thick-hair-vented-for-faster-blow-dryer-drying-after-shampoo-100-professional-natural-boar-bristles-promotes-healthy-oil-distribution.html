            <li>My favorite feature is the curvature of the brush itself, which feels really good against the head.</li>

            <li>Simply the very best brush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>I love *</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine hair that knots up easily.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that both my little girls and the wife are enjoying!</li>
            <li>It is great for natural hair!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, high quality brush.</li>
            <li>It feels too amazing and does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>My daughters love this brush and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>The brush is large, vented and good for blow drying.  </li>
            <li>If there was a way to secure the boar bristles in the brush better</li>
            <li>Wide curved brush head is the greatest.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy on the hair..</li>
            <li>It tangles easily as well.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s through tangles easily too.</li>
            <li>Strong sturdy brush.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 one for each granddaughter who have fine hair that tangles easy..</li>
            <li>I liked it that much!).  </li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars because one it is shedding the boar bristles with every use and two, it creates a tremendous amount of static.</li>
            <li>but this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>It creates a smooth look and creates shine.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy my nightly hair brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is truly a terrific product and I am extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it is, I have to use my cheap brush on my roots, then my detangling comb, then this brush on the ends...</li>
            <li>So smooth</li>
            <li>not too light - like Goldilocks</li>
            <li>Was worried it&#x27;d be really huge but looks like it&#x27;d fit lots of heads out there.</li>
            <li>It fits so nicely to the curve of my head and wraps around to give it a gentle hug while brushing.</li>
            <li>After I started brushing, however, I noticed this brush does a really great job at detangling; the photo shows my hair after ONLY 5 MINUTES OF BRUSHING!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair soft and shiny and does a good job at detangling.</li>
            <li>Feels good to brush my hair with this oversized brush and makes my hair feel soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite hairbrush!  </li>
            <li>This brush is somewhat unique in that it has a curved design that hugs your head as you brush, and it has a combination of boar and nylon bristles.</li>
            <li>Besides that first thing I said when I opened I was this is a cute brush.</li>
            <li>Now I love brushing my hair whereas before I dread brushing ;)</li>
            <li>Great comfort for scalp thanks to the cushion that allows the nylon pins to glide through the natural flow of your hair</li>
            <li>Overall this brush is very light weight, so it&#x27;s very easy to use when styling.</li>
            <li>My nieces love this brush so much they are buying one for themselves.  </li>
            <li>I love the curve of the brush and that it fits my skull very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural boar bristles are the best and are usually very expensive in a hairbrush, but this price is very good.  </li>
            <li>Even though this brush is oversized, it&#x27;s very easy for my 6 year old to use</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush (I even asked my husband to try it out</li>
            <li>This brush is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It really goes through the hair easily and doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out as you are trying to deknot.  </li>
            <li>We have 3 little girls and this brush works great on their hair.</li>
            <li>I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review.</li>
            <li>Gentle on wet hair and great for blow drying, too.</li>
            <li>it is just right</li>
            <li>, it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have long hair and it glides through so nicely.</li>
            <li>Great brush for fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve gotten it right with this brush - thanks!</li>
            <li>Later she told me it was one of the most effective brushes she&#x27;s used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it get the tangles out quickly and easily</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d love it if only the bristles were a bit longer and a lot firmer.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this brush!!  </li>
            <li>My current favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love the extra shine it seems to bring out in my hair.</li>
            <li>The brush head is nice and wide</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a boar bristle brush</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>She is glad she has finally found a solution to detangling her hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be completely honest, I thought it was going to be a brush, like any other bristle brush I have used.  </li>
            <li>(My hair is naturally pretty straight).</li>
            <li>We have tried and used other brushes, but this one is light weight, the bristles soften her hair and once we are done her hair is very manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just strong enough to go through the hair without digging grooves in your scalp.</li>
            <li>and I need to order a few more for my truck and work!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to have for all your needs , I will not buy any other kind of brush again .&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t loose so many bristles each day</li>
            <li>I have extra fine hair that tangles the moment you brush it.</li>
            <li>and I really thought I wanted a pure boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice rubber grip on the handle and (oddly) a little magnet on the end (to hang it perhaps?).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge paddle brush made with different bristles.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I really like that it is over-sized</li>
            <li>and I can just feel my scalp being massaged and generating much needed oil into this gray hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t tear up my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still tangle free 2 minutes later.</li>
            <li>SO much better than the Wet Brush.  </li>
            <li>This really does get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>The  brush really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li>I tried it and my hair does get very tangled</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>It also has generous sized air-vents which make the drying time quite fast.  </li>
            <li>so much I bought a spare.  </li>
            <li>It has a mixture of plastic, non scratching bristles and boar bristles, which work to detangle your hair very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making this available, this will be the only brush my family needs from this point on.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this brush, I went straight to my bathroom to try it out on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This large paddle brush is one of the very few that has ever been able to tackle my hair!</li>
            <li>The bristles work well on my fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Long, smooth, knob-ended plastic bristles massage my scalp while shorter boars hair bristles separate the strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is fine, curly, and on the dry side.</li>
            <li>The boar bristles live up to the hype!</li>
            <li>I think I need to buy more spares to last me the next 20 years.</li>
            <li>My hair is left so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>thought that brushes are created equally and that I didnt really need any special ones.&lt;br /&gt;After all, every brushes just combs your hair to make it soft and neat.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can tell that it is high quality just by looking at it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Works great for long thick hair and my husband loves it as well with his super short hair.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied With the this brush and would recommend it to anyone woman or little girl..  </li>
            <li>The boar pull out the natural oils while the tipped nylon gently stimulate your scalp.</li>
            <li>This lovely durable paddle brush glides through my hair and untangles it without any pain in just a few minutes .I</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush to anyone looking to purchase a new brush.</li>
            <li>It is not very good as a hairdryer or styling brush, but as someone with multiple brushes for different uses, it&#x27;s wonderful overall.</li>
            <li>My new brush just arrived today (</li>
            <li>My only qualms is that I wish the Boar&#x27;s bristle version was as stiff as the non-boar&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It works great on my long thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of strait long hair and this treats it right.</li>
            <li>I shop Amazon for everything (like many of you); and I bought a couple of very expensive boars hair brushes because of the famous name brand.</li>
            <li>I also love it for brushing out my very long hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to it working well on my hair, my daughter who is autistic and has fine hair loves this brush as well.</li>
            <li>As far as working on wet tangled hair, I dont find it to be any better than any of my other normal brushes.</li>
            <li>I like this brush for drying my hair after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It actually felt really</li>
            <li>This brush definitely gets the tangles out of my hair so much quicker and easier than any brush I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush has really helped cut back on the time it takes to brush her hair out .Very</li>
            <li>My 9 years old daughter and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far</li>
            <li>2-days early I might add)  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses a similar brush that lifts my hair &amp; curves the ends gently under.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as much as my old brush which I like</li>
            <li>And the bristles leave your hair soft and static-free without any tangling.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush, I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>My hair when it hair dries without being put up actually just looks like a hot mess which means I always put it up while it&#x27;s wet so that it doesn&#x27;t become even more of a pain.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to teach personal grooming at a young age and since my daughters hair is very long, it&#x27;s a must at our house, and this brush has been a big help.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and because it is naturally wavy it can get tangled and be very unruly.</li>
            <li>and it goes smoothly through wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and easily glides through my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found my hair&#x27;s new BFF</li>
            <li>I got this hairbrush for my youngest daughter, who has very long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>From the fine wispy hair of my youngest, to the thick locks of my eldest, they take turns using this brush to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>I have really fine, fairly thick hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>The large size paddle of the brush allows for more coverage of the head/hair with only a few strokes, whereas with other regular size brushes I could never get stray hairs on the side and the top was always uneven because of a weird cowlick on the top, center of her head.  </li>
            <li>It barely goes through mine and I have&lt;br /&gt;fine hair.</li>
            <li>When you brush, the boar bristles barely reach your scalp, if at all.  </li>
            <li>it just barely goes through.  </li>
            <li>but if you have long natural curly hair you know it takes patience and dedication!</li>
            <li>brush is designed for professional salons for dry or wet hair, is no problem for this large brush.</li>
            <li>It seems like a decent brush and works really well on the ends of my hair (especially with tangles), but even though it says thick hair and the shape is clearly meant to stimulate the scalp-</li>
            <li>the bristles are so short and soft they never make it that deep.</li>
            <li>2 year old hates having her hair brushed with regular brushes.</li>
            <li>At first, I was scared that the brush head was too big and that it would snap in half b/c</li>
            <li>The problem I have with it is the nylon bristles are nearly twice as long as the boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and exactly an hour after receiving it, noticed it went missing.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter has very long curly hair and her and her friends</li>
            <li>I found this brush worked well on dry clean hair with no product in it, but that&#x27;s not when I usually brush</li>
            <li>This brush curves to the shape of your head, so it takes less brush strokes to brush your whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this brush also has those little ball-tipped ends that are very massaging and relaxing.  </li>

            <li> My daughter has very fine hair that knots up easily.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product that both my little girls and the wife are enjoying!</li>
            <li> It is great for natural hair!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, high quality brush.</li>
            <li> It feels too amazing and does such a great job.  </li>
            <li> My daughters love this brush and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> The brush is large, vented and good for blow drying.  </li>
            <li> If there was a way to secure the boar bristles in the brush better</li>
            <li> Wide curved brush head is the greatest.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy on the hair..</li>
            <li> It tangles easily as well.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s through tangles easily too.</li>
            <li> Strong sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 one for each granddaughter who have fine hair that tangles easy..</li>
            <li> I liked it that much!).  </li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because one it is shedding the boar bristles with every use and two, it creates a tremendous amount of static.</li>
            <li> but this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> It creates a smooth look and creates shine.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy my nightly hair brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is truly a terrific product and I am extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it is, I have to use my cheap brush on my roots, then my detangling comb, then this brush on the ends...</li>
            <li> So smooth</li>
            <li> not too light - like Goldilocks</li>
            <li> Was worried it&#x27;d be really huge but looks like it&#x27;d fit lots of heads out there.</li>
            <li> It fits so nicely to the curve of my head and wraps around to give it a gentle hug while brushing.</li>
            <li> After I started brushing, however, I noticed this brush does a really great job at detangling; the photo shows my hair after ONLY 5 MINUTES OF BRUSHING!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair soft and shiny and does a good job at detangling.</li>
            <li> Feels good to brush my hair with this oversized brush and makes my hair feel soft afterward.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite hairbrush!  </li>
            <li> This brush is somewhat unique in that it has a curved design that hugs your head as you brush, and it has a combination of boar and nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> Besides that first thing I said when I opened I was this is a cute brush.</li>
            <li> Now I love brushing my hair whereas before I dread brushing ;)</li>
            <li> Great comfort for scalp thanks to the cushion that allows the nylon pins to glide through the natural flow of your hair</li>
            <li> Overall this brush is very light weight, so it&#x27;s very easy to use when styling.</li>
            <li> My nieces love this brush so much they are buying one for themselves.  </li>
            <li> I love the curve of the brush and that it fits my skull very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural boar bristles are the best and are usually very expensive in a hairbrush, but this price is very good.  </li>
            <li> Even though this brush is oversized, it&#x27;s very easy for my 6 year old to use</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush (I even asked my husband to try it out</li>
            <li> This brush is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It really goes through the hair easily and doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out as you are trying to deknot.  </li>
            <li> We have 3 little girls and this brush works great on their hair.</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review.</li>
            <li> Gentle on wet hair and great for blow drying, too.</li>
            <li> it is just right</li>
            <li> , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have long hair and it glides through so nicely.</li>
            <li> Great brush for fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve gotten it right with this brush - thanks!</li>
            <li> Later she told me it was one of the most effective brushes she&#x27;s used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it get the tangles out quickly and easily</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d love it if only the bristles were a bit longer and a lot firmer.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this brush!!  </li>
            <li> My current favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love the extra shine it seems to bring out in my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush head is nice and wide</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> She is glad she has finally found a solution to detangling her hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be completely honest, I thought it was going to be a brush, like any other bristle brush I have used.  </li>
            <li> (My hair is naturally pretty straight).</li>
            <li> We have tried and used other brushes, but this one is light weight, the bristles soften her hair and once we are done her hair is very manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just strong enough to go through the hair without digging grooves in your scalp.</li>
            <li> and I need to order a few more for my truck and work!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to have for all your needs , I will not buy any other kind of brush again .&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t loose so many bristles each day</li>
            <li> I have extra fine hair that tangles the moment you brush it.</li>
            <li> and I really thought I wanted a pure boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice rubber grip on the handle and (oddly) a little magnet on the end (to hang it perhaps?).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge paddle brush made with different bristles.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I really like that it is over-sized</li>
            <li> and I can just feel my scalp being massaged and generating much needed oil into this gray hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t tear up my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tangle free 2 minutes later.</li>
            <li> SO much better than the Wet Brush.  </li>
            <li> This really does get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> The  brush really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li> I tried it and my hair does get very tangled</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It also has generous sized air-vents which make the drying time quite fast.  </li>
            <li> so much I bought a spare.  </li>
            <li> It has a mixture of plastic, non scratching bristles and boar bristles, which work to detangle your hair very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making this available, this will be the only brush my family needs from this point on.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this brush, I went straight to my bathroom to try it out on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This large paddle brush is one of the very few that has ever been able to tackle my hair!</li>
            <li> The bristles work well on my fine long hair.</li>
            <li> Long, smooth, knob-ended plastic bristles massage my scalp while shorter boars hair bristles separate the strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is fine, curly, and on the dry side.</li>
            <li> The boar bristles live up to the hype!</li>
            <li> I think I need to buy more spares to last me the next 20 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is left so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> thought that brushes are created equally and that I didnt really need any special ones.&lt;br /&gt;After all, every brushes just combs your hair to make it soft and neat.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can tell that it is high quality just by looking at it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Works great for long thick hair and my husband loves it as well with his super short hair.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied With the this brush and would recommend it to anyone woman or little girl..  </li>
            <li> The boar pull out the natural oils while the tipped nylon gently stimulate your scalp.</li>
            <li> This lovely durable paddle brush glides through my hair and untangles it without any pain in just a few minutes .I</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush to anyone looking to purchase a new brush.</li>
            <li> It is not very good as a hairdryer or styling brush, but as someone with multiple brushes for different uses, it&#x27;s wonderful overall.</li>
            <li> My new brush just arrived today (</li>
            <li> My only qualms is that I wish the Boar&#x27;s bristle version was as stiff as the non-boar&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It works great on my long thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of strait long hair and this treats it right.</li>
            <li> I shop Amazon for everything (like many of you); and I bought a couple of very expensive boars hair brushes because of the famous name brand.</li>
            <li> I also love it for brushing out my very long hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to it working well on my hair, my daughter who is autistic and has fine hair loves this brush as well.</li>
            <li> As far as working on wet tangled hair, I dont find it to be any better than any of my other normal brushes.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for drying my hair after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It actually felt really</li>
            <li> This brush definitely gets the tangles out of my hair so much quicker and easier than any brush I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush has really helped cut back on the time it takes to brush her hair out .Very</li>
            <li> My 9 years old daughter and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far</li>
            <li> 2-days early I might add)  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses a similar brush that lifts my hair &amp; curves the ends gently under.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as much as my old brush which I like</li>
            <li> And the bristles leave your hair soft and static-free without any tangling.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair when it hair dries without being put up actually just looks like a hot mess which means I always put it up while it&#x27;s wet so that it doesn&#x27;t become even more of a pain.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to teach personal grooming at a young age and since my daughters hair is very long, it&#x27;s a must at our house, and this brush has been a big help.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and because it is naturally wavy it can get tangled and be very unruly.</li>
            <li> and it goes smoothly through wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and easily glides through my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found my hair&#x27;s new BFF</li>
            <li> I got this hairbrush for my youngest daughter, who has very long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> From the fine wispy hair of my youngest, to the thick locks of my eldest, they take turns using this brush to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, fairly thick hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> The large size paddle of the brush allows for more coverage of the head/hair with only a few strokes, whereas with other regular size brushes I could never get stray hairs on the side and the top was always uneven because of a weird cowlick on the top, center of her head.  </li>
            <li> It barely goes through mine and I have&lt;br /&gt;fine hair.</li>
            <li> When you brush, the boar bristles barely reach your scalp, if at all.  </li>
            <li> it just barely goes through.  </li>
            <li> but if you have long natural curly hair you know it takes patience and dedication!</li>
            <li> brush is designed for professional salons for dry or wet hair, is no problem for this large brush.</li>
            <li> It seems like a decent brush and works really well on the ends of my hair (especially with tangles), but even though it says thick hair and the shape is clearly meant to stimulate the scalp-</li>
            <li> the bristles are so short and soft they never make it that deep.</li>
            <li> 2 year old hates having her hair brushed with regular brushes.</li>
            <li> At first, I was scared that the brush head was too big and that it would snap in half b/c</li>
            <li> The problem I have with it is the nylon bristles are nearly twice as long as the boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and exactly an hour after receiving it, noticed it went missing.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has very long curly hair and her and her friends</li>
            <li> I found this brush worked well on dry clean hair with no product in it, but that&#x27;s not when I usually brush</li>
            <li> This brush curves to the shape of your head, so it takes less brush strokes to brush your whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this brush also has those little ball-tipped ends that are very massaging and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> My only negative response is when you first use it, boar bristles keep falling out of the brush as you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and trying to get tangles out when it is wet can be torturous; this brush actually made somewhat quick (and painless) work of it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly past shoulder length hair that I put product in every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a flat head, why should my brush be?</li>
            <li> I have a ton of thick,curly, and long hair and brushing my hair at times can be a big pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> It works well on my sons hair, but it left my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair frizzy and shaggy looking.</li>
            <li> They just smoosh down against my hair and do nothing until they hit the thinned layers near the ends.</li>
            <li> The boar bristle brush actually helps dry my hair without having it frizz out.</li>
            <li> more hair loss or broken hair by rearranging the split ends and removing dead hair, having a regenerating role on hair.</li>
            <li> I also do not like to spend a long time fixing my hair.  </li>
            <li> We have 2 Wet Brushes that are back up brushes now.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is not only are there bristles</li>
            <li> It does not pull my hair when brushing (I have very long hair)</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to dry faster with a blow dryer when I use this, and it does not hurt my hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone with thick heair.</li>
            <li> When I was single</li>
            <li> they were on my bathroom floor along with loose head-hair.</li>
            <li> I figured out if I detangle my DRY hair with coconut oil and finger combing, then sectioning my hair with a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> , it works well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does help hair dry faster when using it on wet hair as well.</li>
            <li> I suppose it was less painful which is always nice.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair with small ringlets, and had been dying for a boar bristle brush but always have trouble with breakage and getting a comb (let alone a brush!)</li>
            <li> and by that point it&#x27;s not really needed.</li>
            <li> I can only give this 4 stars because I noticed that after 1 use, about 20 boar bristles were already missing &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I am on a learning curve as I have trouble holding the dryer &amp; using the brush 2 the same time</li>
            <li> , I brush when its wet.</li>
            <li> That is an extra bonus since my hair usually takes hours to dry on</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it turns tangles into butter, but it certainly makes brushing through those tangles much easier and less painful than any other brush or comb I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, but it&#x27;s on the thick side, and very long, past my waist.  </li>
            <li> Being autistic she is extra sensitive to pain from knots and tangles and tries to avoid brushing because of it, which makes the problem worse of course.</li>
            <li> Losing bristles already:-( I love the shape though.</li>
            <li> Forget about the other &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> That stuff other&#x27;s might not pay attention to</li>
            <li> I thought all these other people reviewing this product were Crayzee.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair (about 3&amp;#34; from my waist) that has always been a nightmare to brush out wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I had some trouble with bristles falling out initially, but that stopped after a few uses and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the quality of the brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just stiff enough to get through my hair but not so stiff that they hurt my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and its always a challenge to find a brush that actually work to detangle it without breaking it.</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair that sticks up like a bristle in the morning.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is very long and thick, and has wave and some curl, my hair forms knots in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Using two other so-called detangling brushes, I usually spend about 20 minutes of my day trying to brush the knots from my hair.</li>
            <li> The weight of the brush is not too heavy and</li>
            <li> These are so fragile it&#x27;s frustrating</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It just does not go through tangles and knots, rather gives discomfort to scalp and pain , and makes condition of hair really messy.</li>
            <li> She will sit still and let me comb her hair without crying or trying to run off.</li>
            <li> I could not imagine giving it any less than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it stimulated my scalp and all that...</li>
            <li> Usually it takes her forever to get the tangles out of her hair.</li>
            <li> like i have with brushes with handles that are too small.</li>
            <li> If your hair is not SUPER thick, it should work for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hugging&amp;#34; my hair and gently releasing all the messy, painful tangles that typical brushes tear through carelessly.  </li>
            <li> Even for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I can then pass the brush (slowly) through each section of hair no problem.</li>
            <li> do not see how it can be for detangling thick hair</li>
            <li> The way it goes through tangles in my thick, unruly hair?</li>
            <li> all girls with thick hair needed.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try as my hair is as thick as it comes.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with thick, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot walk past it without using it!</li>
            <li> I got this hairbrush for my daughter who has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> the brush head appears to be made of thin plastic.</li>
            <li> This brush cuts down on painful brushing and hair breakage.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird, but I think it was made for just my head.</li>
            <li> I was wrong since purchasing this brush!</li>
            <li> It used to be so bad brushing it after a shower that I cut 6 inches off at one point.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hairbrush has become our favorite for my girls. From the fine wispy hair of my youngest, to the thick locks of my eldest, they take turns using this brush to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> This is my go to brush for my night brushing.  It is gentle and easily glides through my long thick hair.  It creates a smooth look and creates shine.  I enjoy my nightly hair brushing.  I also use this specific brush when I am creating a ponytail as it never leaves strays.  I have a lot of strait long hair and this treats it right.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, it was larger than what I thought it would be. I bought 2 one for each granddaughter who have fine hair that tangles easy..They both said they liked them.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Even for thick hair. Minimum pull, or hurt while it de-tangles.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful. It fits your head as you brush your head. The boar pull out the natural oils while the tipped nylon gently stimulate your scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, but it&#x27;s on the thick side, and very long, past my waist.  I LOVE how this brush conforms to the curves of my head when I&#x27;m brushing--very soothing, and my hair never tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush is just great. The curved edge gives you a nice scalp massage while you brush. The bristles work well on my fine long hair. I use it to blowdry my hair too.</li>
            <li> i actually brush my hair now</li>
            <li> It was bought as a gift. The giftee was very impressed by it. Says it does a good job when blow drying, does not tangle in hair, or break hair</li>
            <li> This is the best boar bristle brush I have found.  I have thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I also do not like to spend a long time fixing my hair.  This brush has solved my problems.  The vents on this brush have helped get tangles out easier and also reduce the drying time.  I really like that it is over-sized so I can work with more hair at the once. The bristles are just stiff enough to get through my hair but not so stiff that they hurt my scalp.  Using this brush has helped distribute the oils evenly and made my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I have really curly hair with small ringlets, and had been dying for a boar bristle brush but always have trouble with breakage and getting a comb (let alone a brush!) throuh my curls. I figured out if I detangle my DRY hair with coconut oil and finger combing, then sectioning my hair with a wide tooth comb I can then pass the brush (slowly) through each section of hair no problem. The trick is to divide it in sections. A bit of a process but if you have long natural curly hair you know it takes patience and dedication! worth it though and felt great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for drying my hair after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;I do not see how it can be for detangling thick hair&lt;br /&gt;though.  It barely goes through mine and I have&lt;br /&gt;fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the plastic bristles and I really thought I wanted a pure boar bristle brush. I LOVE this brush. It works great on my long thick hair!</li>
            <li> So i have been buying brushes in the drugstore and I didnt think it was a biggie.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that brushes are created equally and that I didnt really need any special ones.&lt;br /&gt;After all, every brushes just combs your hair to make it soft and neat.&lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong since purchasing this brush! It&#x27;s a huge paddle brush made with different bristles.&lt;br /&gt;It glides in my scalp so good and smooth. It actually felt really good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like it massages my scalp every stroke, I have never felt so satisfied while brushing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have a plenty of brush in my stash, but since having this one, I have never used another.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my favorite brush now. It doesnt make my hair brittle, and it massage my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;One of the good benefit of it is that it promoted circulation in my scalp which aids in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it! I purchase this using a promo code for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It has the longer ball tipped plastic bristles, and the shorter boar bristles. This brush feels so nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair brush! Quality product and it provides a deep massage. Would buy it again. Wish they would make this smaller or fold-able.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Boar Bristle brush! It does not look fancy or sparkly but it works wonderfully! This large paddle brush is one of the very few that has ever been able to tackle my hair! I have very long hair and because it is naturally wavy it can get tangled and be very unruly.Most brushes pull my hair and cause breakage and damage.This lovely durable paddle brush glides through my hair and untangles it without any pain in just a few minutes .I can&#x27;t recommend it enough! It is truly a terrific product and I am extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was given a discount for providing my honest opinion on this amazing brush</li>
            <li> It seems like a decent brush and works really well on the ends of my hair (especially with tangles), but even though it says thick hair and the shape is clearly meant to stimulate the scalp- the bristles are so short and soft they never make it that deep. They just smoosh down against my hair and do nothing until they hit the thinned layers near the ends. I think I&#x27;d love it if only the bristles were a bit longer and a lot firmer. As it is, I have to use my cheap brush on my roots, then my detangling comb, then this brush on the ends... and by that point it&#x27;s not really needed.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned!! I also ordered one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair texture... I&#x27;ve been looking a brush to help when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair...I&#x27;ve finally found my hair&#x27;s new BFF</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush fits on my head. I know it sounds weird, but I think it was made for just my head. The curve of it is a perfect fit. When I was single I had a hair brush that had boar bristles.It was my favorite brush of all time...and of course, one of my children got a hold of it and I never saw it again. It has been over 10 years. I have now found it&#x27;s replacement. I love the way my hair looks after using this. So smooth and I can just feel my scalp being massaged and generating much needed oil into this gray hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Boar Bristle Brush! I have thick hair, and its always a challenge to find a brush that actually work to detangle it without breaking it. You&#x27;ve gotten it right with this brush - thanks! Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Oh my...I got this for my wife, and she ripped open the package and started brushing her hair while working at the computer as soon as it arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later had to try it on my hair. It was the most amazing feeling! Not sure if it stimulated my scalp and all that...but it did something! I never imagined that a hairbrush could be this amazing! I cannot walk past it without using it!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this brush. Every time I run it through my hair, it&#x27;s easy on the scalp and makes my hair look wonderful. It&#x27;s my new favorite hairbrush!  I was pleasantly surprised! I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review and I love it! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> The brush is large, vented and good for blow drying.  The problem I have with it is the nylon bristles are nearly twice as long as the boar bristles.  When you brush, the boar bristles barely reach your scalp, if at all.  Plus the bristles are already shedding.  Currently, I am using it as a finishing brush on my dog.  He thinks it&#x27;s awesome.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has very long curly hair and her and her friends think this is the total bomb!  It magically untangles their hair in seconds.  They love this product!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING.  I could not imagine giving it any less than 5 stars! I will be completely honest, I thought it was going to be a brush, like any other bristle brush I have used.  OH NO.  This brush is curved to the shape of my head - how BRILLIANT! I don&#x27;t have a flat head, why should my brush be? The other thing I like is not only are there bristles but this brush also has those little ball-tipped ends that are very massaging and relaxing.  The weight of the brush is not too heavy and not too light - like Goldilocks it is just right and the handle is the perfect size to hold.  This is my new favorite brush (I even asked my husband to try it out I liked it that much!).  My only hope is that my teen doesn&#x27;t sneak off with it! I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of thick,curly, and long hair and brushing my hair at times can be a big pain in the butt. However this boar bristle brush works wonders on my hair! My hair when it hair dries without being put up actually just looks like a hot mess which means I always put it up while it&#x27;s wet so that it doesn&#x27;t become even more of a pain. The boar bristle brush actually helps dry my hair without having it frizz out. I love the curve to this brush since it almost fits perfectly with my head so it brushes a lot of my hair at once. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp any which is a big plus. This brush definitely gets the tangles out of my hair so much quicker and easier than any brush I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give this brush a 4 star instead of a 5 because some of the bristles have already started falling out but besides that I would recommend it because it does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> The boar bristles live up to the hype! This brush is awesome. Was worried it&#x27;d be really huge but looks like it&#x27;d fit lots of heads out there.</li>
            <li> This brush is somewhat unique in that it has a curved design that hugs your head as you brush, and it has a combination of boar and nylon bristles. I have thick curly hair, and trying to get tangles out when it is wet can be torturous; this brush actually made somewhat quick (and painless) work of it. It also has a nice rubber grip on the handle and (oddly) a little magnet on the end (to hang it perhaps?). Very happy with my purchase, and I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It is great for natural hair!!</li>
            <li> Have had it for quite a while now and has held up very nicely. No bristles falling out and feels very nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> so glad I bought his -- It really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t tear up my hair.</li>
            <li> It works well on my sons hair, but it left my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair frizzy and shaggy looking.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair that knots up easily.  I had found a brush that worked well but they don&#x27;t make it anymore and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere, so I decided to try this one.  It is amazing and she loves it!  (So do I)  It really goes through the hair easily and doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out as you are trying to deknot.  We highly recommend this brush!!  I also purchased a similar brush and it works just as well!</li>
            <li> Love this brush it nice an it&#x27;s easy on the hair.. Thank You</li>
            <li> Losing bristles already:-( I love the shape though.</li>
            <li> I got this hairbrush for my youngest daughter, who has very long, straight hair.  We have tried and used other brushes, but this one is light weight, the bristles soften her hair and once we are done her hair is very manageable and smooth.  The large size paddle of the brush allows for more coverage of the head/hair with only a few strokes, whereas with other regular size brushes I could never get stray hairs on the side and the top was always uneven because of a weird cowlick on the top, center of her head.  Even though this brush is oversized, it&#x27;s very easy for my 6 year old to use and she can brush/style her own hair by herself now and that is a big deal for all of us!  I think it&#x27;s important to teach personal grooming at a young age and since my daughters hair is very long, it&#x27;s a must at our house, and this brush has been a big help.  I purchased this brush at a discount rate in exchange for my honest review and feedback.</li>
            <li> Ever have a hair bush hug your head? Me either...until now. It fits so nicely to the curve of my head and wraps around to give it a gentle hug while brushing. I have extra fine hair that tangles the moment you brush it. I&#x27;m still tangle free 2 minutes later. When I do hit a snag I don&#x27;t feel it pull at my scalp, I think it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I got this hairbrush for my daughter who has very thick hair. It tangles easily as well. This brush has really helped cut back on the time it takes to brush her hair out .Very nice quality too!</li>
            <li> This is the third one we have bought.  My nieces love this brush so much they are buying one for themselves.  This brush cuts down on painful brushing and hair breakage.  SO much better than the Wet Brush.  We have 2 Wet Brushes that are back up brushes now.</li>
            <li> What a great hairbrush. My daughters love this brush and how easy it is to use. This really does get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing as a massage for your head. I also love it for brushing out my very long hair when it&#x27;s wet. It is not very good as a hairdryer or styling brush, but as someone with multiple brushes for different uses, it&#x27;s wonderful overall.</li>
            <li> Forget about the other &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; hairbrush. This brush is awesome!! My 9 years old daughter and I are fighting to use the brush LOL. It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth it. I will definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> This brush works great it definitely took out all my tangles and brushes thru my hair and takes out the tangles quickly definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> These are so fragile it&#x27;s frustrating but they are such wonderful brushes I keep buying them anyway. Brushing your hair with them is like getting a scalp massage. The bristles are just strong enough to go through the hair without digging grooves in your scalp. I love the curve of the brush and that it fits my skull very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair soft and shiny and does a good job at detangling. My current favorite brush. I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far just so I can find one when my kids steal them.</li>
            <li> Me and the children love it</li>
            <li> I do love this brush. My only qualms is that I wish the Boar&#x27;s bristle version was as stiff as the non-boar&#x27;s kind. Other than that I really love this brush!</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush.  My hair does seem to dry faster with a blow dryer when I use this, and it does not hurt my hair or scalp.  Actually, the reason why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because, believe it or not, it does not get all the way to my scalp on the back of my head, where my hair is thickest.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.  If your hair is not SUPER thick, it should work for you!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  It does not pull my hair when brushing (I have very long hair) and it goes smoothly through wet or dry hair.  I take it with me to the beach and even my daughters love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I received this brush  , and I must say I was so impressed . The  brush really does what is claims to do. I tried it and my hair does get very tangled , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  brush is designed for professional salons for dry or wet hair, is no problem for this large brush.Great comfort for scalp thanks to the cushion that allows the nylon pins to glide through the natural flow of your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more hair loss or broken hair by rearranging the split ends and removing dead hair, having a regenerating role on hair.Kids will also love it as they will not have to bear the pains of a comb pulling on their hair and damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works amazingly and is  very attractive to boot.I highly recommend this brush to have for all your needs , I will not buy any other kind of brush again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair (about 3&amp;#34; from my waist) that has always been a nightmare to brush out wet or dry.  This brush changes all of that, and feels very comfortable in my hand, as well.  I won&#x27;t say it turns tangles into butter, but it certainly makes brushing through those tangles much easier and less painful than any other brush or comb I have owned.  I love this brush! Five stars without reservation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that both my little girls and the wife are enjoying!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Better than expected. Love the extra shine it seems to bring out in my hair. Besides that first thing I said when I opened I was this is a cute brush. Love the design on the handle. That stuff other&#x27;s might not pay attention to but I did. Lol</li>
            <li> Great brush for fine thin hair.  Will order more as gifts for all the women in my life.</li>
            <li> Simply the very best brush I have ever owned! I have three daughters and we have a lot of hair products,  but this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> I love *almost* everything about this brush. The way the curve fits to my head feels like a scalp massage at a spa. The way it goes through tangles in my thick, unruly hair? Divine.  The only thing I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of is the fact that it makes my hair static-y. But, that is taken care of with just a spritz of product on the brush as I use it and it is not nearly enough to keep me from using it. It feels too amazing and does such a great job.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for detangling and oil distribution. My only negative response is when you first use it, boar bristles keep falling out of the brush as you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> My new brush just arrived today (2-days early I might add)  and I just love it!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Natural boar bristles are the best and are usually very expensive in a hairbrush, but this price is very good.  The brush head is nice and wide so you can do a larger section at a time when blow drying, straightening or smoothing.  It also has generous sized air-vents which make the drying time quite fast.  Overall this brush is very light weight, so it&#x27;s very easy to use when styling.</li>
            <li> This brush feels great!!!  Long, smooth, knob-ended plastic bristles massage my scalp while shorter boars hair bristles separate the strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted relief from a 100% boars hair brush that irritated my scalp.  I bought this.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and some of my family will get these in their stockings this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is very long and thick, and has wave and some curl, my hair forms knots in my sleep. Using two other so-called detangling brushes, I usually spend about 20 minutes of my day trying to brush the knots from my hair. I&#x27;m very impressed by the Boar Bristle Brush sold by Superlative Salons. At first, I was scared that the brush head was too big and that it would snap in half b/c the brush head appears to be made of thin plastic. After I started brushing, however, I noticed this brush does a really great job at detangling; the photo shows my hair after ONLY 5 MINUTES OF BRUSHING! (See before/after photo.) I can only give this 4 stars because I noticed that after 1 use, about 20 boar bristles were already missing &#x3D; they were on my bathroom floor along with loose head-hair. If there was a way to secure the boar bristles in the brush better so I wouldn&#x27;t loose so many bristles each day, then this would be a 5-star brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! My hair feels great after I use it and I need to order a few more for my truck and work!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a boar bristle brush and I love it! Not only does it get the tangles out quickly and easily, it works well on wet or dry hair. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon so far! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Lovvvvveeee this brush! It&#x27;s the only brush that can brush through my coarse tangled hair. Now I love brushing my hair whereas before I dread brushing ;)</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses a similar brush that lifts my hair &amp; curves the ends gently under.I am on a learning curve as I have trouble holding the dryer &amp; using the brush 2 the same time</li>
            <li> Would brush my hair all day if I could.</li>
            <li> I once had a concave brush I loved, but it got lost 20 years ago.  Thankfully, I found this one and I LOVE it so much I bought a spare.  It is the perfect brush for softly massaging your scalp while you brush.  I think I need to buy more spares to last me the next 20 years.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful brush for hair massage but does absolutely nothing to my hair tangles and knots.  It just does not go through tangles and knots, rather gives discomfort to scalp and pain , and makes condition of hair really messy. I would only recommend this brush for massage</li>
            <li> A nice brush that feels great going through my hair.  The head of the brush isn&#x27;t a solid construction, it has holes in the head for air-flow while drying.  The handle has a nice rubbery grip but the name plate kind of gets in the way, that&#x27;s the only CON I found.  I like that there are both plastic bristles as well as the softer, fiber bristles, too.  Feels good to brush my hair with this oversized brush and makes my hair feel soft afterward.  *This product was provided to me for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> I have very curly past shoulder length hair that I put product in every day. It used to be so bad brushing it after a shower that I cut 6 inches off at one point. I found this brush worked well on dry clean hair with no product in it, but that&#x27;s not when I usually brush, I brush when its wet. As far as working on wet tangled hair, I dont find it to be any better than any of my other normal brushes. Bristles started falling out the second time I used it. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush until it broke after four months.  I didn&#x27;t even drop it.  Washed it in the sink and it broke.</li>
            <li> What a great brush! I have short, thick hair that sticks up like a bristle in the morning. Before this brush, I had to soak my hair to brush it into shape; with this brush, I don&#x27;t! Another very nice feature is that I feel like I am getting a head massage each time I use it. I highly recommend this brush to anyone with thick heair.</li>
            <li> Works great for long thick hair and my husband loves it as well with his super short hair.</li>
            <li> I read that boar bristle brushes was a staple all girls with thick hair needed. So I thought I&#x27;d try as my hair is as thick as it comes. I personally don&#x27;t quite see what the hype is. The brush didn&#x27;t get through all my layers so I still needed to brush the outside and the inside of my hair. I suppose it was less painful which is always nice. But I still had to use my detangler to help with the ease.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush.  Have long hair and it glides through so nicely.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as much as my old brush which I like</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, high quality brush. It has a mixture of plastic, non scratching bristles and boar bristles, which work to detangle your hair very well. This brush curves to the shape of your head, so it takes less brush strokes to brush your whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old hates having her hair brushed with regular brushes. She loves this brush! She will sit still and let me comb her hair without crying or trying to run off. She even runs around with this brush trying comb in her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking to purchase a new brush. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely incredible! I have a lot hair but it is fine, curly, and on the dry side. I get tangles if I do not brush a lot, when sleeping, and also get knots from from pony tail holders, especially if I fall asleep with one on. This brush goes through the knots and tangles like nobody&#x27;s business, yet it doesn&#x27;t hurt while doing so, and it leaves your hair looking nice. It does help hair dry faster when using it on wet hair as well. That is an extra bonus since my hair usually takes hours to dry on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to it working well on my hair, my daughter who is autistic and has fine hair loves this brush as well. Being autistic she is extra sensitive to pain from knots and tangles and tries to avoid brushing because of it, which makes the problem worse of course. Brushing is not an issue now! Thanks so much for making this available, this will be the only brush my family needs from this point on.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, fairly thick hair...it just barely goes through.  It feels good on my scalp...I had some trouble with bristles falling out initially, but that stopped after a few uses and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the quality of the brush.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! My daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This brush is my new favorite. You can tell that it is high quality just by looking at it. I think hair os even shinier rhan when I started using it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this brush, I went straight to my bathroom to try it out on my hair.  This thing is amazing and made brushing my hair SO easy and painless.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hugging&amp;#34; my hair and gently releasing all the messy, painful tangles that typical brushes tear through carelessly.  My hair is left so smooth and soft.  VERY happy with this product and will be recommending!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! My sister loves this brush!! Everything about it is incredible. It brushes through hair with ease. I will not hesitate buying this brush again as a gift for someone else. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brush. The weather is warming up and we went out in the convertible. Usually it takes her forever to get the tangles out of her hair. When we got home she tried this brush and she got her hair brushed out in no time without alot of pain. She also likes the curve of the brush, it feels like it hugs your head. She is glad she has finally found a solution to detangling her hair.</li>
            <li> I thought all these other people reviewing this product were Crayzee. Then I got the brush. Like Janice on Friends: OMG! I just never wanna stop brushing my hair!!! Phenomenal!! Whoever invented this should earn an award. And my hair!! It&#x27;s silky smooth now!!! What?! Go. Brush!</li>
            <li> This Brush was amazing to use. 100% satisfied With the this brush and would recommend it to anyone woman or little girl..  We have 3 little girls and this brush works great on their hair. The brush head is large and the handle is a perfect size for gripping. I do not experience cramping in my hand like i have with brushes with handles that are too small. The brush does an awesome job detangling our hair and does not catch and pull hair. Very nicely designed brush!!!</li>
            <li> WOW! This has got to be one of the best detangling brush there is.  And when your kids don&#x27;t complain that says it all. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This brush feels like a head massage.  The size and shape are just perfect.  It is very big but not too big.  Get&#x27;s through tangles easily too.</li>
            <li> I shop Amazon for everything (like many of you); and I bought a couple of very expensive boars hair brushes because of the famous name brand. The fact is that you can afford a brush with true quality just by buying this awesome product. The style and contour makes for a really great brush.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with thick, medium length hair. I love this great hairbrush! The weight is very light. The handle has a nice, tactile rubber grip. My favorite feature is the curvature of the brush itself, which feels really good against the head. And the bristles leave your hair soft and static-free without any tangling. Should work well on all hair types and lengths. Gentle on wet hair and great for blow drying, too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does great job detangling and works great for blow drying my hair. I did not give it 5 stars because one it is shedding the boar bristles with every use and two, it creates a tremendous amount of static. (My hair is naturally pretty straight).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and exactly an hour after receiving it, noticed it went missing. Why?  Who?  My wife....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She saw this brush, tried it out, and immediately stashed it away.  Later she told me it was one of the most effective brushes she&#x27;s used in a long time.  Highly recommended.  Give it a try - you&#x27;ll agree too.  Plus, the with unique brush head shape, it removes tangles very effectively.  WIN WIN!</li>
            <li> Strong sturdy brush. EXCELLENT purchase ...</li>
            <li> Oooooohhhh it feels so good on my scalp. Curved brush doesn&#x27;t stab my head. Wide curved brush head is the greatest.</li>
