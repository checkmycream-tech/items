    <ol>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>So, great product, however don&#x27;t pay $15!</li>
            <li>This one is excellent!</li>
            <li>It stays perfectly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I am tempted to try the TRESemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion Creme and compare the two.</li>
            <li>It maintains the curl all day and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you need your hair to retain that curl perfectly throughout the day though, you may not like it.</li>
            <li>When I had relaxed hair, this was the best thing ever!!</li>
            <li>It is great product for curly hair without causing damage!</li>
            <li>Very good leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Manages my frizzy hair and gives me beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Great product, but is discontinued.</li>
            <li>Gave it to a friend and it works great for her.</li>
            <li>and I use this before I put on my hair gel because this works great with it</li>
            <li>Great service and response</li>
            <li>is reputable and on time.product came in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>I am yet to find the one that will be a good substitution for it.</li>
            <li>Still a good product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m A Doll On A Budget) but its a good product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use it with the gel and conditioner from this line of curls product, &amp;LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it has a nice smell...</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to comb the isles of CVS and pay a lot more!</li>
            <li>This cream is awesome, it makes the curls soft and it doesn&#x27;t stiffen my hair like gel.</li>
            <li>perfect curls for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it worked OK.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It was a good product, touchable curls, curls look soft, smells good.</li>
            <li>If I triple the amount to use it works better</li>
            <li>I do much much better with Doves serum...</li>
            <li>Many curl products I have tried do not enhance my curls.</li>
            <li>much more then in store.</li>
            <li>and  I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>Hope it never goes away as I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair with static.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think people with thicker, curlier hair would be able to use it every day.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s affordable - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>:) I would have gave 5 stars</li>
            <li>and i had do deal with the &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34; - this product is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m looking for a miracle cream that will make my wavy frizzy hair into beautiful soft curls.</li>
            <li>This one actually shapes his curls and defines them, they look healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, there is absolutely zero difference between this and Tresemme Flawless Curls Lotion Creme for $4 at Walmart for 6 oz.</li>
            <li>but it is wavy and gets easily frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My curls are soft, nicely defined and they smell nice, too.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this enables me to easily bring out curls without leaving any residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tangles easily and is shoulder lenth</li>
            <li>I put this stuff in right after a bath and her curls go from frizzy frump to beautiful, soft, waves and spirals.  </li>
            <li>To get any effect at all from it, I have to use a huge glob and even then it just sort of dissolves like water into my hair.</li>
            <li>This product was paraben free when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and really sculpts my waves into voluminous curls.</li>
            <li>Added this to the cart for free shipping and really do enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>and I use this product to maintain the curl with light blow drying.</li>
            <li>i have curly hair as it is, but this makes my curls smooth and shiny and gets rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li>this is good for soft curls with no definition, I like it for days</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re touchable but they are pretty :)</li>
            <li>I like citrus and clean smells.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this product  as an add-on after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find anything too particularly special about this product at all and don&#x27;t even get me started on the fact</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see it doing anything special to my hair</li>
            <li>Okay, I really like this hair milk.</li>
            <li>So, I love this product and am so glad I have been able to find it online, because it has been absent from most store shelves lately.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling sticky afterwards like a lot of other leave in products do.</li>
            <li>did nothing to calm my frizz or help straighten my hair-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also claims to \\&quot;calm flyaways with its humidity-resistant formula\\&quot; - well, not quite.</li>
            <li>You can comb thru it after set and it tends to calm your hair.</li>
            <li>, lovely curls that look totally natural.  </li>
            <li>I use this to make my hair look more alive</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I would use this for braidouts and twist outs and get the best results, that would last several days and keep my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve found that does not make my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>It worked well at first.</li>
            <li>almost STRAIGHT (not to mention frizzy)!</li>
            <li>I have a light natural curl/waves and this seems to do nothing at all or just flattens it.</li>
            <li>&quot; and \\&quot;encourage the slightest waves\\&quot; - it definitely does that: my curls are now significantly more defined while retaining their natural soft look and feel, the overall texture is lovely and more</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I will be sticking with Garnier&#x27;s Curl Calm Down, which provides far superior soft-curl definition.</li>
            <li>My hair is more wavy than curly, but I comb this product through it with my fingers after washing it, and then scrunch it a bit, and it keeps the curl looking natural, soft, and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I tried couple of other ones and nothing else can be as good for my hair so far.</li>
            <li>this works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit sticky when it is almost dry, this is a good time to crunch your hair a bit enhance the curls.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will have the same effect on my curls, which are fine compared to his.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item hoping to find something that would really help make the curls pop...</li>
            <li>my hair is much softer and not greasy at all and smells</li>
            <li>The product is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now I use this in combination with another cream leave-in conditioner and my hair feels much lighter and healthier.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried leaving it on my hair without blow drying or doing anything , but it doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I only need to use the size of a dime on my hands and it does the job of keeping my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I curl my hair, so I don&#x27;t use it to keep my hair straight, just silky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very nourished.</li>
            <li>I tried using more product, less product, applying to drier hair, wetter hair--</li>
            <li>For the price I payed ($5.27), this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I wanted something to emphasize my waves a little more but this product didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the product works great, but I usually combine it with a less holding product, mainly for smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been using another product for years, but decided to try a new one.  </li>
            <li>Although it smells good and makes my hair soft, it weighs down the curls to the point they&#x27;re not really curls anymore.  </li>
            <li>top it off, the product has a great fragrance and will probably last me a long time; my hair goes a little past my shoulders</li>
            <li>This product creates a very soft curl, so your hair doesn&#x27;t end up feeling crunchy at all.</li>
            <li>Such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>My hair is not very thick</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was curious how it would compare to my current favorite curl cream (Garnier&#x27;s Curl Calm Down).</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, not stiff.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and touchable in the morning.</li>
            <li>Both products work well and feel the same, but this shaping milk costs about 3 times as much per ounce, so will stick to buying the lotion creme.</li>
            <li>Refreshes the curls and soft.</li>
            <li>The hair wound not freeze, the curls are soft, not like you apply the curling gel product.</li>
            <li>So far Tressamme  seems to be working  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only stuff that really works on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I just want soft natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy to curly hair</li>
            <li>Using John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo helped tame the frizz, though I am yet to test it on rainy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I purchased it, it was $8.99, which is kind of ridiculous since I see a product very similar to it by Tresemme at Wal-Mart for like $3.99.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Does pretty much the same thing as any other creme.</li>
            <li>I am african american with 3c/4a curls &amp;&amp; I really like this product, It defines my curls really well, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it can leave your hair feeling \\&quot;unclean\\&quot; by the end of the day</li>
            <li>My daughter has red coarse straight, wavy, and curly hair all mixed in.  </li>
            <li>not as expected didnt keep the curls very well.</li>
            <li>maybe a 2 for natural girls with 4b/4c hair, and 0 if you do the sections too big.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised at how small the bottle is for the price, but so far it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>None of that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, hard wet look that most curling gels produce.  </li>
            <li>It was very difficult for me to find the one that will be good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I work a dime-sized amount of this into my shoulder length hair (when wet, of course) and I get soft (touchable!)</li>
            <li>Most cremes meant for curls either don&#x27;t work , make my hair greasy, smell bad, or make my hair really frizzy.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair very nourished.</li>
            <li> I tried using more product, less product, applying to drier hair, wetter hair--</li>
            <li> For the price I payed ($5.27), this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I wanted something to emphasize my waves a little more but this product didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the product works great, but I usually combine it with a less holding product, mainly for smell.  </li>
            <li> I have been using another product for years, but decided to try a new one.  </li>
            <li> Although it smells good and makes my hair soft, it weighs down the curls to the point they&#x27;re not really curls anymore.  </li>
            <li> top it off, the product has a great fragrance and will probably last me a long time; my hair goes a little past my shoulders</li>
            <li> This product creates a very soft curl, so your hair doesn&#x27;t end up feeling crunchy at all.</li>
            <li> Such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> My hair is not very thick</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was curious how it would compare to my current favorite curl cream (Garnier&#x27;s Curl Calm Down).</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, not stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and touchable in the morning.</li>
            <li> Both products work well and feel the same, but this shaping milk costs about 3 times as much per ounce, so will stick to buying the lotion creme.</li>
            <li> Refreshes the curls and soft.</li>
            <li> The hair wound not freeze, the curls are soft, not like you apply the curling gel product.</li>
            <li> So far Tressamme  seems to be working  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only stuff that really works on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I just want soft natural curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy to curly hair</li>
            <li> Using John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo helped tame the frizz, though I am yet to test it on rainy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I purchased it, it was $8.99, which is kind of ridiculous since I see a product very similar to it by Tresemme at Wal-Mart for like $3.99.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Does pretty much the same thing as any other creme.</li>
            <li> I am african american with 3c/4a curls &amp;&amp; I really like this product, It defines my curls really well, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it can leave your hair feeling \\&quot;unclean\\&quot; by the end of the day</li>
            <li> My daughter has red coarse straight, wavy, and curly hair all mixed in.  </li>
            <li> not as expected didnt keep the curls very well.</li>
            <li> maybe a 2 for natural girls with 4b/4c hair, and 0 if you do the sections too big.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised at how small the bottle is for the price, but so far it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> None of that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, hard wet look that most curling gels produce.  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult for me to find the one that will be good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I work a dime-sized amount of this into my shoulder length hair (when wet, of course) and I get soft (touchable!)</li>
            <li> Most cremes meant for curls either don&#x27;t work , make my hair greasy, smell bad, or make my hair really frizzy.</li>
            <li> The end result is essentially the same as having no product in your hair at all--except that your hair is actually flatter and LESS CURLY than it would normally be.</li>
            <li> When I scrunch product in normally my curls are immediately defined, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually produces the OPPOSITE effect--after scrunching it into my hair, my hair looks flat, lifeless...</li>
            <li> I based this purchase on good reviews, but am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff tends to leave my hair a little greasy at the end of the day but provides a natural overall look for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> naturally curly/wavy hair that is a frizzy, untamed mess without product.  </li>
            <li> This makes my son&#x27;s hair so curly and hydrated unlike other products where his hair would go back to being extra frizzy.</li>
            <li> this product really did nothing but make my curls hard</li>
            <li> At the same time, hair is very soft and touchable-not hard and crunchy like you get with alot of gels.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little stubborn and it&#x27;s a little wavy but mainly straight.</li>
            <li> After it is completely dry the stickyness is gone.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry after you wash it out.</li>
            <li> You put in on on damp hair, you dry it, curls are intact and absolutely no friz.</li>
            <li> I am low maintenance when it comes to hair products and usually will settle for convenience and cost over anything else; however, after trying this product, it is the only hair product that I will look for online and buy if I can&#x27;t find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to prep my hair after putting the product in (e.g. scrunching and/or twisting wet hair into curls).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to be a careful label reader at ALL times.  </li>
            <li> It did not really eliminate frizz.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended that I just wet my hair a bit if this happens</li>
            <li> Have always been using clairol herbal essence max hold, but for some reason, its been harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> By mid evening, my hair had dried out a lot and felt rough.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it continuously throughout the week or else my hair starts to get a little too oilly and flat.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a product to tame his curls.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair (I&#x27;m white by the way).</li>
            <li> You need to use only a small amount of the milk.</li>
            <li> And this works with other curling cremes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my third review today and all of them have one thing in common.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe they&#x27;ve almost tripled the price of this product in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s less weight on the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but very little is needed, and it really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> SO NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Then I throw a little of this in.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell but its a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I used to use hair gel every day for my curls but it would lead to heavy, sometimes greasy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> So I use it after a few washes, take a break for a few days, and then start using it again.  </li>
            <li> actually, i think it made it worse and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems like a watered down version of the conditioner, and I usually leave some of the conditioner in my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> The dramatic price increase since the last time I bought the products.</li>
            <li> If I just used this I would be out of it within two weeks because it is a small bottle, so consider that when ordering.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small bottle.</li>
            <li> it use it everyday to fix my curls!</li>
            <li> This is a product we have been using for a number of years and is hard to find in  stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in stores lately, so</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t terrible, but a bit cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li> Also makes my hair feel dirty by the next day.</li>
            <li> For a small bottle at that!</li>
            <li> I have hair whose \\&quot;curliness\\&quot; varies in different areas (2C/3A/3B), so taming it is almost mission impossible.</li>
            <li> No good for me.</li>
            <li> As A prime member I&#x27;m getting disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it was discontinued</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the product is discontinued.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> did nothing to calm my frizz or help straighten my hair- actually, i think it made it worse and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it says. It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve found that does not make my hair crunchy. You put in on on damp hair, you dry it, curls are intact and absolutely no friz. Love it.</li>
            <li> Curls have definition and last all day-no frizz!! At the same time, hair is very soft and touchable-not hard and crunchy like you get with alot of gels. I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in stores lately, so I hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
            <li> I am african american with 3c/4a curls &amp;&amp; I really like this product, It defines my curls really well, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it can leave your hair feeling \\&quot;unclean\\&quot; by the end of the day, I do however recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hair is a little stubborn and it&#x27;s a little wavy but mainly straight. I wanted something to emphasize my waves a little more but this product didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises! My curls are soft, nicely defined and they smell nice, too. You need to use only a small amount of the milk. It is a tiny bit sticky when it is almost dry, this is a good time to crunch your hair a bit enhance the curls. After it is completely dry the stickyness is gone. The hair is soft, not stiff. No visible residue, either. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product, but is discontinued.</li>
            <li> This stuff tends to leave my hair a little greasy at the end of the day but provides a natural overall look for my curly hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re touchable but they are pretty :)</li>
            <li> I am low maintenance when it comes to hair products and usually will settle for convenience and cost over anything else; however, after trying this product, it is the only hair product that I will look for online and buy if I can&#x27;t find in the store.  I have tried alternatives and even more expensive products don&#x27;t come close to the results this one produces.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is a frizzy, untamed mess without product.  I work a dime-sized amount of this into my shoulder length hair (when wet, of course) and I get soft (touchable!), lovely curls that look totally natural.  None of that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, hard wet look that most curling gels produce.  I don&#x27;t even have to prep my hair after putting the product in (e.g. scrunching and/or twisting wet hair into curls).  I have baby fine hair and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  So, I love this product and am so glad I have been able to find it online, because it has been absent from most store shelves lately.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product  as an add-on after reading so many positive reviews. It worked well at first. My hair was soft and touchable in the morning. By mid evening, my hair had dried out a lot and felt rough.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, there is absolutely zero difference between this and Tresemme Flawless Curls Lotion Creme for $4 at Walmart for 6 oz. Both products work well and feel the same, but this shaping milk costs about 3 times as much per ounce, so will stick to buying the lotion creme.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping to find something that would really help make the curls pop...it worked OK. The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling sticky afterwards like a lot of other leave in products do. However, I didn&#x27;t find anything too particularly special about this product at all and don&#x27;t even get me started on the fact it&#x27;s now $15.00 a bottle. For a small bottle at that! SO NOT WORTH IT! When I purchased it, it was $8.99, which is kind of ridiculous since I see a product very similar to it by Tresemme at Wal-Mart for like $3.99. I cannot believe they&#x27;ve almost tripled the price of this product in less than a month. I would save my money and go to Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and did what is was supposed to do. It tamed the hair and I will see how  well it goes towards the curls when i am finished with this bottle</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My hair is more wavy than curly, but I comb this product through it with my fingers after washing it, and then scrunch it a bit, and it keeps the curl looking natural, soft, and not frizzy.  Even in the cold, and dryness of winter, I just need to dampen it in the morning with some water, and voila, it looks nice again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and smells fresh and clean.  My daughter has red coarse straight, wavy, and curly hair all mixed in.  It&#x27;s a nightmare to fix.  I put this stuff in right after a bath and her curls go from frizzy frump to beautiful, soft, waves and spirals.  I only wash her hair every 4 days.  In between washing I just use a bottle of water that has a touch of conditioner for curly hair.  Then I throw a little of this in.  Refreshes the curls and soft.</li>
            <li> This product was paraben free when I purchased it.  I have looked at CVS and it wasn&#x27;t. You&#x27;ve got to be a careful label reader at ALL times.  Boo.  Anyway, the product works great, but I usually combine it with a less holding product, mainly for smell.  I like citrus and clean smells.  This isn&#x27;t terrible, but a bit cheap smelling.  I have purchased $40 Salon products that did not show off my curls, hence the fancy smells I like.  So, great product, however don&#x27;t pay $15! for it!  I purchased as an Ad On Item for about $5 last year.  Now I guess I&#x27;ll hit the stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was curious how it would compare to my current favorite curl cream (Garnier&#x27;s Curl Calm Down). Well, it doesn&#x27;t. To get any effect at all from it, I have to use a huge glob and even then it just sort of dissolves like water into my hair. When I scrunch product in normally my curls are immediately defined, wet or dry. This stuff actually produces the OPPOSITE effect--after scrunching it into my hair, my hair looks flat, lifeless...almost STRAIGHT (not to mention frizzy)! I tried using more product, less product, applying to drier hair, wetter hair--bottom line: no difference. The end result is essentially the same as having no product in your hair at all--except that your hair is actually flatter and LESS CURLY than it would normally be. I gave it two stars because it has a nice smell... In conclusion, I will be sticking with Garnier&#x27;s Curl Calm Down, which provides far superior soft-curl definition.</li>
            <li> Such a reasonable price!  I love that I don&#x27;t have to comb the isles of CVS and pay a lot more!</li>
            <li> Does pretty much the same thing as any other creme. I like the smell but its a bit heavy so feels like lotion in hair</li>
            <li> Although it smells good and makes my hair soft, it weighs down the curls to the point they&#x27;re not really curls anymore.  Also makes my hair feel dirty by the next day.</li>
            <li> It was a good product, touchable curls, curls look soft, smells good. but it made me breakout i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Have ordered 3from this seller since they are discontinued.great product for curly hair.keeps curls in place and hair feels great.seller is reputable and on time.product came in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> I based this purchase on good reviews, but am completely disappointed. My hair stayed frizzy with a funky waxy/sticky feeling, and the second day it felt like there was furniture polish in it. Eeeooo! I finally found a product called &#x27;It&#x27;s a Ten - Miracle Leave-in plus Keratin&#x27;. It&#x27;s expensive, but very little is needed, and it really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> When use the directed amount.  If I triple the amount to use it works better but then when it dries on my hair it leaves a build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  I do much much better with Doves serum...that stuff rocks!!!</li>
            <li> my hair is much softer and not greasy at all and smells good!&lt;br /&gt;I like this milk and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> For the price I payed ($5.27), this is highly recommended. I believe it is about the same in stores too. Many curl products I have tried do not enhance my curls. It leaves my hair frizzy. This is my third review today and all of them have one thing in common. The dramatic price increase since the last time I bought the products. I payed $5.27 and now its $12.99, much more then in store. The reason I use Amazon is because I don&#x27;t have time to go to the store or I don&#x27;t like the stores here or the products I want are not there. As A prime member I&#x27;m getting disappointed.</li>
            <li> This makes my son&#x27;s hair so curly and hydrated unlike other products where his hair would go back to being extra frizzy. This one actually shapes his curls and defines them, they look healthy and beautiful. I finally found a product to tame his curls. I haven&#x27;t yet tried it for myself, but I will soon and hopefully it will have the same effect on my curls, which are fine compared to his. His hair being a bit thicker than my \\&quot;baby fine\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the product is discontinued. It was very difficult for me to find the one that will be good for my hair. This one is excellent! The hair wound not freeze, the curls are soft, not like you apply the curling gel product. It stays perfectly throughout the day. The product is very affordable. I am yet to find the one that will be a good substitution for it. I tried couple of other ones and nothing else can be as good for my hair so far.</li>
            <li> I have hair whose \\&quot;curliness\\&quot; varies in different areas (2C/3A/3B), so taming it is almost mission impossible. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to \\&quot;create soft-defined, movable curls\\&quot; and \\&quot;encourage the slightest waves\\&quot; - it definitely does that: my curls are now significantly more defined while retaining their natural soft look and feel, the overall texture is lovely and more unified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also claims to \\&quot;calm flyaways with its humidity-resistant formula\\&quot; - well, not quite. It did not really eliminate frizz.  Using John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo helped tame the frizz, though I am yet to test it on rainy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how small the bottle is for the price, but so far it seems to work really well. I am tempted to try the TRESemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion Creme and compare the two.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product for years, but decided to try a new one.  So far Tressamme  seems to be working  as  I want it  to and  I am pleased.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to use hair gel every day for my curls but it would lead to heavy, sometimes greasy looking hair.  Now I use this in combination with another cream leave-in conditioner and my hair feels much lighter and healthier.  If I just used this I would be out of it within two weeks because it is a small bottle, so consider that when ordering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only stuff that really works on my curly hair.  Smells nice too and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  Can&#x27;t find it on the shelves at any stores anymore.  Hope it never goes away as I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I have a light natural curl/waves and this seems to do nothing at all or just flattens it. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> not as expected didnt keep the curls very well.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair (I&#x27;m white by the way). Most cremes meant for curls either don&#x27;t work , make my hair greasy, smell bad, or make my hair really frizzy. All except this one. It smells amazing and really sculpts my waves into voluminous curls.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair with static. I have tried leaving it on my hair without blow drying or doing anything , but it doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> this is good for soft curls with no definition, I like it for days I just want soft natural curls.</li>
            <li> Very good leave in conditioner. Added this to the cart for free shipping and really do enjoy the product. The bottle, only 4.5 ounces, is smaller than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s advertised correctly. I just imagined 4.5 ounces as bigger for whatever reason. Still a good product.</li>
            <li> Eh, it was alright. I guess I&#x27;m looking for a miracle cream that will make my wavy frizzy hair into beautiful soft curls. This one is not doing that.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it didn&#x27;t do anything. Gave it to a friend and it works great for her. So obviously results vary.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy to curly hair and I use this product to maintain the curl with light blow drying. It maintains the curl all day and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was disappointed to find out it was discontinued so I immediately stocked up on it on Amazon.  My hair is not very thick but it is wavy and gets easily frizzy.  I only need to use the size of a dime on my hands and it does the job of keeping my hair smooth and silky.  I curl my hair, so I don&#x27;t use it to keep my hair straight, just silky.  I can&#x27;t use it continuously throughout the week or else my hair starts to get a little too oilly and flat.  So I use it after a few washes, take a break for a few days, and then start using it again.  I think people with thicker, curlier hair would be able to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have fine hair and this enables me to easily bring out curls without leaving any residue on my hair. I can use it the next day if I choose not to wash my hair again without any buildup. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product creates a very soft curl, so your hair doesn&#x27;t end up feeling crunchy at all. If you need your hair to retain that curl perfectly throughout the day though, you may not like it. My hair stylist recommended that I just wet my hair a bit if this happens and it&#x27;ll just go back to curly again. And this works with other curling cremes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, the product has a great fragrance and will probably last me a long time; my hair goes a little past my shoulders and I use about a dime sized amount. Plus, it&#x27;s affordable - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This tresemme product can&#x27;t be found in my area anymore. This is a product we have been using for a number of years and is hard to find in  stores.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tangles easily and is shoulder lenth this just makes it feel like there is a lot of goo on it.  It makes it tangle even easier.  No good for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, I really like this hair milk. It leaves my hair very nourished. I don&#x27;t like the size of the bottle, I wish it was bigger (I&#x27;m A Doll On A Budget) but its a good product. I don&#x27;t use a lot (about 2 quarters in the morning &amp; sometimes at night) . I use it with the gel and conditioner from this line of curls product, &amp;LOVE it! :) I would have gave 5 stars but it&#x27;s a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my hair look more alive and I use this before I put on my hair gel because this works great with it, dont think its what its meant for but It works for me.</li>
            <li> this product really did nothing but make my curls hard</li>
            <li> When I had relaxed hair, this was the best thing ever!! I would use this for braidouts and twist outs and get the best results, that would last several days and keep my hair super soft. Since I&#x27;ve been transitioning, it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the same hold I once got, so I&#x27;d rate a 5 for relaxed girls, and maybe a 2 for natural girls with 4b/4c hair, and 0 if you do the sections too big.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome, it makes the curls soft and it doesn&#x27;t stiffen my hair like gel. it also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry after you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Manages my frizzy hair and gives me beautiful curls. Wish I could buy in a bigger bottle. Great service and response</li>
            <li> i have curly hair as it is, but this makes my curls smooth and shiny and gets rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> It seems like a watered down version of the conditioner, and I usually leave some of the conditioner in my hair anyway. I guess it&#x27;s less weight on the hair. Since it&#x27;s such a tiny bottle and I don&#x27;t see it doing anything special to my hair I can&#x27;t say I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is great product for curly hair without causing damage! it use it everyday to fix my curls! I love it!</li>
            <li> Have always been using clairol herbal essence max hold, but for some reason, its been harder to find in stores and i had do deal with the &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34; - this product is FABULOUS! I was orginally looking for something called MILK that comes in a blue bottle that they sell at my salon for $45 - this works just as good if not better. perfect curls for my naturally curly hair. fights frizz.</li>
            <li> It s for a softer hold.  You can comb thru it after set and it tends to calm your hair.</li>
