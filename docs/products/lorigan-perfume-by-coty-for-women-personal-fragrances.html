            <li>Best of all , the price for the quality defies logic .</li>
            <li>great price perfect Valentine&#x27;s day gift</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I wear it, my mother wore it, and both my grandmother and great grandmother wore it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great my mom loves the perfume.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>So happy that I found it.</li>
            <li>I think this could be a great fragrance for ANY occasion or any age .</li>
            <li>So happy to know where I can now find it and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;Boomer&amp;#34;, I think of my Grandmother and my Mother and pleasant memories.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, the label DOES say \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;, and one can never expect an $11.00 eau-de-cologne to have the depth, dimension and substantivity of an EDP.</li>
            <li>Good memories.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Mom who has always loved this flavor.</li>
            <li>Was very happy that this product was a full bottle considering it was discontinued</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li>I Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The perfume is amazingly FEMININE .</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for years and was so happy to find it on the Amazon site as it is so had to find any more.  </li>
            <li>This modern version has the fundamental quality of vintage L&#x27;ORIGAN, but all the notes here are \\&quot;accordioned\\&quot; together, so they do not \\&quot;unfold\\&quot; impressively as the vintage might.</li>
            <li>BUT, this cologne spray smells nice for about 3 minutes and the cost means it is not a bargain.</li>
            <li>But Coty&#x27;s Products have been popular with my maternal family since it was established.  </li>
            <li>I love the musk good for outdoor life</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally , this perfume is the fragrance used to scent Coty face powder , the kind that sat on my Grandma&#x27;s vanity .</li>
            <li>How wonderful to find my favorite fragrance dating from high school 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I will wear this just as a pleasant, light, tous-les-jours cologne, not expecting anything more of it.</li>
            <li>I just love it, its a great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I would have appreciated it even more if it had arrived with its own attractive box</li>
            <li>Spray very lightly..</li>
            <li>more can you ask for&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You want to keep your marriage--these is one way to express your love</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I love the classics perfumes</li>
            <li>I used it many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is bringing back some very happy times.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy anything else; to be able to purchase any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also free postage for orders $25.00 or over !</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I just love this scent, it reminds me of my grandmother,  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I hope they continue making it for many years.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it for over ...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it was formulated in 1909</li>
            <li>I really, really love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells cheap, kind of like plastic.</li>
            <li>love this one..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to look on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Use to wear this years ago, getting many favorable responses to it.  </li>
            <li>Found this online again and have had even more favorable comments.  </li>
            <li>So glad to see it offered online.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Her eyes lit up and it made her so happy to have it again thanks.</li>
            <li>I love these old-fashioned Coty fragrances.</li>
            <li>favorite perfume about 20 or more years ago until they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this fragrance, one of the most \\&quot;retro\\&quot; ones still manufactured by Coty today.</li>
            <li>In fact, many people aren&#x27;t wearing perfume because of allergies..</li>
            <li>I also noted that my mom&#x27;s favorite, Emeraude, can be found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just so pleased to sniff my favorite again.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume in the summer.  </li>
            <li>This is a famous fragrance created by a perfume genius - Francois Coty .</li>
            <li>Monsieur Coty was a creative genius , and L&#x27;Origan is a lovely testimony to his skill .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>and then it mellows into this wonderful kind of vanilla powdery smell just so pretty and different</li>
            <li>Whereas many of the classic perfumes you can get at a great bargain, and the quality and fragrance are far superior.</li>
            <li>The scent was WAY too strong, and it smelled like something that my Grandmother would wear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of roses nor lavender nor strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>My 21year old even liked it!</li>
            <li>Was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon for it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>I just hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li>Was so happy to see it back again.  </li>
            <li>Over 100 years later it is still one of the great fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I am happy we found this fragrance, it brings back memories.</li>
            <li>It has a light powder fragrance to it and stays with me all day.  </li>
            <li>Coty is meant to wear lightly.</li>
            <li>with light prints or distressed jeans.</li>
            <li>will proudly put this on the shelf next to my Dior Addict , Dior Hypnotic Poison, and Coco Chanel !</li>
            <li>Emraude is sexy but use lightly, good with black and printed top.</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume it smells just like airspun powder when you first put it on</li>
            <li>This scent is unique and feminine</li>
            <li>this is the original scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to revisit your youth!</li>
            <li>Wore this in my younger days and loved it so much!!!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Aimant makes the feel special.</li>
            <li>The sweet vanilla/wintergreen one would like is just not appearing here.</li>
            <li>I will keep the bottle and sniff the sprayer for return of sweet memories.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but also not something</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the palest tint of what the fragrance used to be; I&#x27;m lucky to also have a decant of some 1960&#x27;s-vintage parfum-de-toilette for comparison.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>&quot; here-- the remaining notes do have a natural, organic quality that please me more than most modern releases do---</li>
            <li>The amazing quality I notice is that this fragrance is basically SOFT , yet lasts forever - it has perfect projection - not overwhelming yet softly makes itself known in an unintrusive fashion.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it more for the nostalgia than the actual scent.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Aimant, my favorite is a soft fragrance that can be worn on a date.</li>
            <li>the kind women used to wear 30 years back.</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments from wearing this cologne than any of the other top name brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, make your purchase right</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly, and I was very excited to see one of my favorite scents for sale, as it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Better than I even imagined it would be, a lovely soft fragrance, a bit of citrus, slightly incense smokey, and a little powdery, a great scent.</li>
            <li>to Macy&#x27;s and pay four times or more for the same product&lt;</li>
            <li>Back using my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>THANKS COTY!</li>
            <li>it has been discontinued but still readily availabe from Amazon at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the positive reviews that this fragrance received.</li>
            <li>Before it became the premiere purveyor of \\&quot;they-all-smell-alike\\&quot; celebrity stinks, Coty was the most innovative and creative of all the perfume houses.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Origan is a spicy floral with good sillage and long lasting power(If</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly lacking the vividness and depth of vintage L&#x27;ORIGAN.</li>
            <li>We have since found a large bottle and will use it sparingly</li>
            <li>thanks glenda garcia</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>She ordered it the very moment she tried it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THANKS...</li>
            <li>Very disappointinig.</li>
            <li>It is a light floral scent which can be worn by both young and old.</li>
            <li>LIKE IT Very Much as it is a warm, powdery fragrance with depth, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>An old favourite !!!</li>
            <li>My first fragrance and as a girl becoming  a young lady, wearing it was like long pants  for a boy.  </li>
            <li>This is a powdery perfume that started out nice, but developed into an odd scent that did not work with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>There are hundreds of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; sellers that do not smell half as good  and disappear shortly after $praying .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very traditional sweet and spicy smell--</li>
            <li>I think my mother would love it, but I belong to a different generation, and L&#x27;Origan reminds me of old closets and clothes smelling of old perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a decade since I have been able to track down a bottle of this spray.  </li>
            <li>this is my husband favorite colonge so ill be buying a lot more in the furture</li>
            <li>Lasting power is OK, but what do you expect for such an affordable perfume.</li>
            <li>The older City perfumes I wore according to what I was wearing and where I was going.</li>
            <li>Been using this since high school.  </li>
            <li>Wore this in high school...</li>
            <li>In fact, very few of the  modern perfumes impress me today, true there are a few good ones out there, but the prices are almost always overblown for  the quality.</li>
            <li>The reviews made me expect a little more.</li>
            <li>Soft smell and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most womanly perfumes I have ever smelled - ladylike , soft , classic and yet not dull or flat .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t knock people over.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I remember from my younger days.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly the same as she remembered.</li>
            <li>Just as some have predicted, the new version almost completely lacks</li>
            <li>I was NOT very excited to spray it on and find that it smells NOTHING like the original.  </li>
            <li>I remember buying the remaining two bottles at the local drugstore and making them last as long as I could many years ago</li>
            <li>My original one came in a black cologne bottle.  </li>
            <li>Soft and floral with a hint of sexy...was worried it would be soured,but  not so.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like the old bottle I used to have years ago.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Diluted product or possibly a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; of real Coty L&#x27;Origan.&lt;br /&gt;Bought three.</li>
            <li>It is a soft spicy oriental and combines orange blossom, vanilla, and spices .</li>
            <li>Even though it was created over 100 years ago , it does not at all smell like an old lady .</li>
            <li>BTW,  on me, L&#x27;Origan smells exactly like Guerlain&#x27;s much more expensive L&#x27;Heure Bleue.  </li>
            <li>The only scent I&#x27;ll wear, love it, wearing it for the past 56 years.</li>
            <li>ONLY A CLASSIC can be that versatile .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always had compliments where ever I go from both from male and female - young and old.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m just so pleased to sniff my favorite again.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume in the summer.  </li>
            <li> This is a famous fragrance created by a perfume genius - Francois Coty .</li>
            <li> Monsieur Coty was a creative genius , and L&#x27;Origan is a lovely testimony to his skill .</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> and then it mellows into this wonderful kind of vanilla powdery smell just so pretty and different</li>
            <li> Whereas many of the classic perfumes you can get at a great bargain, and the quality and fragrance are far superior.</li>
            <li> The scent was WAY too strong, and it smelled like something that my Grandmother would wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of roses nor lavender nor strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> My 21year old even liked it!</li>
            <li> Was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon for it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I just hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to see it back again.  </li>
            <li> Over 100 years later it is still one of the great fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I am happy we found this fragrance, it brings back memories.</li>
            <li> It has a light powder fragrance to it and stays with me all day.  </li>
            <li> Coty is meant to wear lightly.</li>
            <li> with light prints or distressed jeans.</li>
            <li> will proudly put this on the shelf next to my Dior Addict , Dior Hypnotic Poison, and Coco Chanel !</li>
            <li> Emraude is sexy but use lightly, good with black and printed top.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume it smells just like airspun powder when you first put it on</li>
            <li> This scent is unique and feminine</li>
            <li> this is the original scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to revisit your youth!</li>
            <li> Wore this in my younger days and loved it so much!!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Aimant makes the feel special.</li>
            <li> The sweet vanilla/wintergreen one would like is just not appearing here.</li>
            <li> I will keep the bottle and sniff the sprayer for return of sweet memories.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but also not something</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the palest tint of what the fragrance used to be; I&#x27;m lucky to also have a decant of some 1960&#x27;s-vintage parfum-de-toilette for comparison.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> &quot; here-- the remaining notes do have a natural, organic quality that please me more than most modern releases do---</li>
            <li> The amazing quality I notice is that this fragrance is basically SOFT , yet lasts forever - it has perfect projection - not overwhelming yet softly makes itself known in an unintrusive fashion.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it more for the nostalgia than the actual scent.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Aimant, my favorite is a soft fragrance that can be worn on a date.</li>
            <li> the kind women used to wear 30 years back.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments from wearing this cologne than any of the other top name brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, make your purchase right</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly, and I was very excited to see one of my favorite scents for sale, as it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Better than I even imagined it would be, a lovely soft fragrance, a bit of citrus, slightly incense smokey, and a little powdery, a great scent.</li>
            <li> to Macy&#x27;s and pay four times or more for the same product&lt;</li>
            <li> Back using my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> THANKS COTY!</li>
            <li> it has been discontinued but still readily availabe from Amazon at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the positive reviews that this fragrance received.</li>
            <li> Before it became the premiere purveyor of \\&quot;they-all-smell-alike\\&quot; celebrity stinks, Coty was the most innovative and creative of all the perfume houses.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Origan is a spicy floral with good sillage and long lasting power(If</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly lacking the vividness and depth of vintage L&#x27;ORIGAN.</li>
            <li> We have since found a large bottle and will use it sparingly</li>
            <li> thanks glenda garcia</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> She ordered it the very moment she tried it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> THANKS...</li>
            <li> Very disappointinig.</li>
            <li> It is a light floral scent which can be worn by both young and old.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT Very Much as it is a warm, powdery fragrance with depth, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> An old favourite !!!</li>
            <li> My first fragrance and as a girl becoming  a young lady, wearing it was like long pants  for a boy.  </li>
            <li> This is a powdery perfume that started out nice, but developed into an odd scent that did not work with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> There are hundreds of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; sellers that do not smell half as good  and disappear shortly after $praying .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very traditional sweet and spicy smell--</li>
            <li> I think my mother would love it, but I belong to a different generation, and L&#x27;Origan reminds me of old closets and clothes smelling of old perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a decade since I have been able to track down a bottle of this spray.  </li>
            <li> this is my husband favorite colonge so ill be buying a lot more in the furture</li>
            <li> Lasting power is OK, but what do you expect for such an affordable perfume.</li>
            <li> The older City perfumes I wore according to what I was wearing and where I was going.</li>
            <li> Been using this since high school.  </li>
            <li> Wore this in high school...</li>
            <li> In fact, very few of the  modern perfumes impress me today, true there are a few good ones out there, but the prices are almost always overblown for  the quality.</li>
            <li> The reviews made me expect a little more.</li>
            <li> Soft smell and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most womanly perfumes I have ever smelled - ladylike , soft , classic and yet not dull or flat .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t knock people over.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remember from my younger days.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly the same as she remembered.</li>
            <li> Just as some have predicted, the new version almost completely lacks</li>
            <li> I was NOT very excited to spray it on and find that it smells NOTHING like the original.  </li>
            <li> I remember buying the remaining two bottles at the local drugstore and making them last as long as I could many years ago</li>
            <li> My original one came in a black cologne bottle.  </li>
            <li> Soft and floral with a hint of sexy...was worried it would be soured,but  not so.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the old bottle I used to have years ago.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Diluted product or possibly a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; of real Coty L&#x27;Origan.&lt;br /&gt;Bought three.</li>
            <li> It is a soft spicy oriental and combines orange blossom, vanilla, and spices .</li>
            <li> Even though it was created over 100 years ago , it does not at all smell like an old lady .</li>
            <li> BTW,  on me, L&#x27;Origan smells exactly like Guerlain&#x27;s much more expensive L&#x27;Heure Bleue.  </li>
            <li> The only scent I&#x27;ll wear, love it, wearing it for the past 56 years.</li>
            <li> ONLY A CLASSIC can be that versatile .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had compliments where ever I go from both from male and female - young and old.</li>
            <li> There were no unexpected problems.</li>
            <li> I dislike the spray and long for the splash on</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a  very long time...</li>
            <li> No real loss, however, since I ended up giving it as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> then any other perfume out there.</li>
            <li> I even had other people wanting me to placeorders for them.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> Tried other brands but could not seem to like anything.</li>
            <li> Curiously, the marzipan/heliotropin foundation seems kissed here by nutmeg, black pepper, the violet ionones and some slight \\&quot;green\\&quot; notes (coriander,  probably).</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s not an outdated old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was changed, is old, or is a knockoff, but it actually smells unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND, BUT I DID AND WILL CONTINUE ORDERING IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  </li>
            <li> Frankly , I was let down by L&#x27;heure Blue and found it cold and flat and was puzzled by its popularity .</li>
            <li> Not to heavy but stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> They took it off the market, at least here on the west coast</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of this and vaguely remembering it as a teenager, I thought I could save a few bucks from my usual expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it,I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> weak scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very hard to get.  </li>
            <li> But, alas:  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Was having a difficult time finding it in my area.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone looking for something not too expensive and smells yummy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes they evaporate and even start smelling bad.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received in the mail smelled SO AWFUL.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is my husband favorite colonge so ill be buying a lot more in the furture thanks glenda garcia</li>
            <li> It smells just like the old bottle I used to have years ago. The scent brings wonderful memories to mind.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume it smells just like airspun powder when you first put it on and then it mellows into this wonderful kind of vanilla powdery smell just so pretty and different then any other perfume out there.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine for years and was so happy to find it on the Amazon site as it is so had to find any more.  I have always had compliments where ever I go from both from male and female - young and old. It is a light floral scent which can be worn by both young and old. I just hope that it will always be available.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remember from my younger days.  Love this fragrance. Not to heavy but stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a childhood memory but it&#x27;s just not the same. It&#x27;s like putting on water. The smell disappears in minutes.</li>
            <li> Better than I even imagined it would be, a lovely soft fragrance, a bit of citrus, slightly incense smokey, and a little powdery, a great scent. I am only 31 but I love the classics perfumes, they make me feel chic &amp; feminine. In fact, very few of the  modern perfumes impress me today, true there are a few good ones out there, but the prices are almost always overblown for  the quality. Whereas many of the classic perfumes you can get at a great bargain, and the quality and fragrance are far superior. This scent is unique and feminine which is what I look for in a perfume. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very soft fragrance. Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a  very long time... I used it many years ago. I love it and it is bringing back some very happy times.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this scent years ago and I am so happy I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> This is a powdery perfume that started out nice, but developed into an odd scent that did not work with my chemistry.  I like the bottle and the smell of the perfume from the bottle, but wearing it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes. Was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon for it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Received my bottle today of the current formula of Coty L&#x27;ORIGAN in the cologne spray. Yes... it&#x27;s just the palest tint of what the fragrance used to be; I&#x27;m lucky to also have a decant of some 1960&#x27;s-vintage parfum-de-toilette for comparison. To be fair, the label DOES say \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;, and one can never expect an $11.00 eau-de-cologne to have the depth, dimension and substantivity of an EDP. This modern version has the fundamental quality of vintage L&#x27;ORIGAN, but all the notes here are \\&quot;accordioned\\&quot; together, so they do not \\&quot;unfold\\&quot; impressively as the vintage might. Just as some have predicted, the new version almost completely lacks the signature eugenol/clove note--  forbidden by current IFRA statutes---  that, truth told, was the raison d&#x27;etre of the scent on its debut in 1904. Curiously, the marzipan/heliotropin foundation seems kissed here by nutmeg, black pepper, the violet ionones and some slight \\&quot;green\\&quot; notes (coriander,  probably). The sweet vanilla/wintergreen one would like is just not appearing here. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say the scent is \\&quot;ruined\\&quot; here-- the remaining notes do have a natural, organic quality that please me more than most modern releases do--- but it&#x27;s certainly lacking the vividness and depth of vintage L&#x27;ORIGAN. I will wear this just as a pleasant, light, tous-les-jours cologne, not expecting anything more of it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance for over 50 years.  Very hard to get.  Thank you for still carrying it and for the&lt;br /&gt;affordable price.  Will contact you again when I run low.  WATSUP</li>
            <li> Like I tryed to tell you, I will no longer buy L&#x27;Origan perfume by: Coty from you!&lt;br /&gt;I found someone who will meet or beat your prices!  Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy anything else; to be able to purchase any.&lt;br /&gt;There is also free postage for orders $25.00 or over ! I even had other people wanting me to placeorders for them.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, your loss is another companies gain ! Disappeared customer , Lisa</li>
            <li> I love the scent. My mother and her mother used it. BUT, this cologne spray smells nice for about 3 minutes and the cost means it is not a bargain. I will keep the bottle and sniff the sprayer for return of sweet memories. I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent, it reminds me of my grandmother,  I just love it, its a great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I remember this scent as a child and I love it.  The bottle I received in the mail smelled SO AWFUL.  There is NO WAY this is the original scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. I wear it, my mother wore it, and both my grandmother and great grandmother wore it. I have had more compliments from wearing this cologne than any of the other top name brands.  I hope they continue making it for many years.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from my childhood!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it for over ...maybe 15 years.  My original one came in a black cologne bottle.  It smells like I remember it.</li>
            <li> I like scents for the memories they can evoke.  This one my grandmother wore...so when I smell it I think of her. For those who can relate...this provides that experience.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. And what a price! This has definitely become my signature scent. I absolutely love that it was formulated in 1909 so I feel this sense of history when I wear it. That said, it&#x27;s not an outdated old lady perfume. Lasting power is OK, but what do you expect for such an affordable perfume. I really, really love this perfume.</li>
            <li> its okay,just didn&#x27;t like  as I did when I was younger</li>
            <li> Great my mom loves the perfume.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of this and vaguely remembering it as a teenager, I thought I could save a few bucks from my usual expensive perfume. I was wrong. This stuff smells cheap, kind of like plastic. Not good. I suppose it&#x27;s a matter of taste, but I will never, ever use the bottle I bought. Save your money until you can afford Dior or Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> love this one..I got it as a gift when I was a young girl.  I&#x27;m glad I found it again,&lt;br /&gt;My sister saw it on my dresser and tried it.  She ordered it the very moment she tried it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my neighbor.  She loves it.  Keeps ordering it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the positive reviews that this fragrance received. When I finally got it,I was extremely disappointed. The scent was WAY too strong, and it smelled like something that my Grandmother would wear. No real loss, however, since I ended up giving it as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Been using this since high school.  Was having a difficult time finding it in my area. tried for years to find it. Tried other brands but could not seem to like anything. Glad I decided to look on Amazon. Back using my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> This is the drug store stuff you remember from childhood. I enjoy it more for the nostalgia than the actual scent.</li>
            <li> Basically, the smell is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, make your purchase right away.&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Use to wear this years ago, getting many favorable responses to it.  They took it off the market, at least here on the west coast about 30 years go.  Found this online again and have had even more favorable comments.  It&#x27;s a very soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t knock people over.</li>
            <li> Wore this in my younger days and loved it so much!!! So glad to see it offered online.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> the perfume was just as I remembered it years ago.  I wondered why I ever stopped using it.  I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. Wore it when I was younger. Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wore this in high school...Iloved it then and now. Was so happy to see it back again.  Smelled everybit as wonderful as I remember.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  Pleased. Hadnt seen Lorigan in quite some time.Glad I found it. Great</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly, and I was very excited to see one of my favorite scents for sale, as it is hard to find.  I was NOT very excited to spray it on and find that it smells NOTHING like the original.  I don&#x27;t know if it was changed, is old, or is a knockoff, but it actually smells unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Described perfectly. Delivered promptly. I&#x27;m very happy &amp; recommend this seller &amp; product.</li>
            <li> Was very happy that this product was a full bottle considering it was discontinued sometimes they evaporate and even start smelling bad. According to grandma it&#x27;s exactly the same as she remembered. Her eyes lit up and it made her so happy to have it again thanks.</li>
            <li> Before it became the premiere purveyor of \\&quot;they-all-smell-alike\\&quot; celebrity stinks, Coty was the most innovative and creative of all the perfume houses.  L&#x27;Origan is one of the reasons why.  L&#x27;Origan is a spicy floral with good sillage and long lasting power(If you want to know what it smells like, go the drugstore and smell the Coty Airspun powder -- it is scented with L&#x27;Origan).  Over 100 years later it is still one of the great fragrances.  But, alas:  it has been discontinued but still readily availabe from Amazon at a very reasonable price.  Buy several bottles, stock up.  BTW,  on me, L&#x27;Origan smells exactly like Guerlain&#x27;s much more expensive L&#x27;Heure Bleue.  You might want to compare the two and purchase accordingly.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT Very Much as it is a warm, powdery fragrance with depth, but not too heavy.  But Coty&#x27;s Products have been popular with my maternal family since it was established.  As a &amp;#34;Boomer&amp;#34;, I think of my Grandmother and my Mother and pleasant memories.  My first fragrance and as a girl becoming  a young lady, wearing it was like long pants  for a boy.  An old favourite !!!</li>
            <li> I am happy we found this fragrance, it brings back memories. We have since found a large bottle and will use it sparingly</li>
            <li> I love these old-fashioned Coty fragrances. They remind me of my grandmother, and I will wear them forever. They are timeless.</li>
            <li> I was blown away after all these years Coty has brought back L&#x27;Origan!  This was me and my mothers favorite perfume about 20 or more years ago until they stopped making it.  My mom is now 94 and I can&#x27;t wait to send her some for Christmas!  THANKS COTY!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!  I wish they had a lotion to match it.  It has a light powder fragrance to it and stays with me all day.  It is not a over- powering fragrance. I have had many compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance, one of the most \\&quot;retro\\&quot; ones still manufactured by Coty today. I would have appreciated it even more if it had arrived with its own attractive box - Coty says it has one - but I have yet to see it with any vendor.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND, BUT I DID AND WILL CONTINUE ORDERING IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  THANKS...</li>
            <li> The older City perfumes I wore according to what I was wearing and where I was going. I don&#x27;t like the smell of roses nor lavender nor strong perfumes. In fact, many people aren&#x27;t wearing perfume because of allergies.. But let me tell you about L&#x27;Origan. Coty is meant to wear lightly. I wear it brown and jeans I had a vest to cmplete the outfit and western boots. L&#x27;Aimant, my favorite is a soft fragrance that can be worn on a date. Spray very lightly.. As with all Coty he scent lungeofs.L&#x27;Aimant makes the feel special. I wear white blouses or Tees. with light prints or distressed jeans. Emraude is sexy but use lightly, good with black and printed top. Lastly the musk. I love the musk good for outdoor life</li>
            <li> My mother used to wear this fragrance all the time.  I wear it a lot because it reminds me of her.  Good memories.</li>
            <li> The reviews made me expect a little more. It has a very traditional sweet and spicy smell-- the kind women used to wear 30 years back. I think my mother would love it, but I belong to a different generation, and L&#x27;Origan reminds me of old closets and clothes smelling of old perfumes. It&#x27;s not bad, but also not something Iwould  want to wear.</li>
            <li> Does not hold its scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very weak scent.&lt;br /&gt;Diluted product or possibly a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; of real Coty L&#x27;Origan.&lt;br /&gt;Bought three. Very disappointinig.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just like I remembered. It&#x27;s fun to revisit your youth! There were no unexpected problems. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The only scent I&#x27;ll wear, love it, wearing it for the past 56 years. So happy that I found it.</li>
            <li> How wonderful to find my favorite fragrance dating from high school 50 years ago.  I remember buying the remaining two bottles at the local drugstore and making them last as long as I could many years ago when I heard that it was discontinued by Coty.  I also noted that my mom&#x27;s favorite, Emeraude, can be found on Amazon.  I dislike the spray and long for the splash on but I&#x27;m just so pleased to sniff my favorite again.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume in the summer.  Soft smell and reasonable price.  I recommend it to anyone looking for something not too expensive and smells yummy.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Can buy this anywhere. I didn&#x27;t want to miss out on a last opportunity to have a back up bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a famous fragrance created by a perfume genius - Francois Coty . It was later copied and \\&quot;tweaked\\&quot; by Jacque Guerlain in the form of the EXPEN$IVE L&#x27;Heure Blue . L\\&quot;heure Blue is still sold at Neiman Marcus and is universally admired . Recently , I sampled L&#x27;heure Blue ( Neimans ) and then decided to order L&#x27;origan after reading perfume reviews at several sites online. Frankly , I was let down by L&#x27;heure Blue and found it cold and flat and was puzzled by its popularity . When I received the bottle of L&#x27;Origan, I was not expecting to like it - . What a surprise ! L&#x27;Origan is BEAUTIFUL ! I now understand why the reviewers praise it . The perfume is amazingly FEMININE . It is a soft spicy oriental and combines orange blossom, vanilla, and spices . To my nose it smells somewhat similar to Tresor with a dash of orange blossom . The amazing quality I notice is that this fragrance is basically SOFT , yet lasts forever - it has perfect projection - not overwhelming yet softly makes itself known in an unintrusive fashion. This is one of the most womanly perfumes I have ever smelled - ladylike , soft , classic and yet not dull or flat .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think this could be a great fragrance for ANY occasion or any age . ONLY A CLASSIC can be that versatile .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally , this perfume is the fragrance used to scent Coty face powder , the kind that sat on my Grandma&#x27;s vanity . Even though it was created over 100 years ago , it does not at all smell like an old lady . If you try it , I doubt you will regret it . Best of all , the price for the quality defies logic . Monsieur Coty was a creative genius , and L&#x27;Origan is a lovely testimony to his skill . There are hundreds of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; sellers that do not smell half as good  and disappear shortly after $praying .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will proudly put this on the shelf next to my Dior Addict , Dior Hypnotic Poison, and Coco Chanel !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom who has always loved this flavor. She did not think it smelled like it use to smell. I wish they would sell this locally. It has not been sold in stores for years. It did come on time and looked the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a decade since I have been able to track down a bottle of this spray.  So happy to know where I can now find it and at a good price.  It smells just like I remember!  Love it!</li>
