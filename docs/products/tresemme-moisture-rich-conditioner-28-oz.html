            <li>I am, honestly, delighted.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is ok but nothing great.</li>

            <li>I believe her as her gorgeous brown hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>found that this shampoo did a nice job.</li>
            <li>And, the scent is very nice - kind of like fresh fruit.  </li>
            <li>the present price of under $6 for 28oz, it is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>It does all the things I want in a good shampoo: nice rich lather, smells good, leaves my hair super clean.  </li>
            <li>course, this is only wonderful if the shampoo \\&quot;works\\&quot; for your type of hair.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I use the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure/Strong/Moist line of shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair needs more conditioning than provided just by using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was created with women in mind, but the scent and quality of this shampoo make it appropriately unisex.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
            <li>She said it was more like a two-in-one product, with shampoo and conditioner in one bottle.  </li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m better,</li>
            <li>When I started lathering this shampoo into my hair, I had to look at the bottle to make sure it was not a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Big price differences between Unilever&#x27;s shampoos and TRESemme being the cheapest in my opinion is also the best.</li>
            <li>frizzies start showing up at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, I&#x27;ve had even better results with high end shampoos at four times the price, but this stuff is great for the price.</li>
            <li>It works up to a nice lather when washing your hair and rinses out cleanly, leaving no residue or film.  </li>
            <li>She says it makes her scalp feel great and makes her hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how soft this has made my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good quality shampoo that is extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>A good choice for the whole family.used twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good quality shampoo that is extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>A good choice for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I love trying new hair products and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I prefer volumizing shampoo for my own hair, but this would be great for someone who needs something a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It was so smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I&#x27;ve colored for years</li>
            <li>I did not need to use a moisturizer to take the tangles out as my comb glided smoothly through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightly squeeze the shampoo from roots to ends and rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, we are happy with it.</li>
            <li>Not knocking Nexxus, but the TRESemme does the same thing Performance wise as the Nexxus , it has a much better and milder smell to it with no mixability issues.</li>
            <li>When I poured it out, I noticed its clean and light scent.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>TRESemme Shampoo, Moisture Rich</li>
            <li>Rich, sumptuous hair.  </li>
            <li>and I dont have to use a lot to get the hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for dry or color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I can tell you, the label is true to its name - it is moisture rich.</li>
            <li>Even two days later, my hair felt clean and smelled good.</li>
            <li>I find them to be the most gentle</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize, cleans great and has a low, subtle odor to it which is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This moisture rich clean scented shampoo is perfect for daily use as it adds moisture and shine with silky softness without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with dry hair who&#x27;s looking for a good hydrating shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was a first!</li>
            <li>The Dove is very good, but the smell was a little overpowering and smells like a woman&#x27;s product and it seems to have to much conditioner/moisturizer  in it.</li>
            <li>The price is great per ounce but beware the bottle is heavy and unwieldy when trying to get the product out</li>
            <li>I love how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>The dryness was something Aussie Moist helped control, but I found the Tresemme Moist Rich Shampoo worked very well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a rich, creamy lather and is gentle on the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Would buy again for the right price.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable, soft, and easy to style.</li>
            <li>To be honest I swap out shampoos every bottle to prevent build-up, so there is no “normal” shampoo for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used TRESemme shampoo.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using TreSemme Moisture Rich shampoo</li>
            <li>Low and behold, based on my answers to their questions, Moisture Rich was one of three shampoos recommended for me!</li>
            <li>hair is easy to manage, is not dry or brittle.  </li>
            <li>28 whopping ounces; a very generous quantity at a very reasonable</li>
            <li>The shampoo is rich and thick, but I find I have to use more than other shampoos in order to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>It lathers profusely (thanks to the Laureth Sulfate), has a nice, non-cloying floral/fruity aroma, and cleaned my hair and scalp extremely well without the need to shampoo/rinse/repeat.</li>
            <li>This hits the right balance between clean and over-stripped; my hair is left soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I decided to go on the TRESemme web site and take the short \\&quot;Hair PROfiler\\&quot; quiz easily located on the home page.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, rinses out easily, and leave my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>has worked out very well.  </li>
            <li>Simple all in one shampoo, leaves the hair smooth and shiny every day.</li>
            <li>2) Gently massage the scalp and roots with fingertips to work into a lather.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo claims to be 4x moisturizing - and it really is.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked very well, so when I decided to try this one</li>
            <li>My dry ends and dry section looked good.</li>
            <li>I use to keep down the new growth that use to stick out like static, I feel pretty presentable.  </li>
            <li>I have used Aussie Moist shampoo for at least 12 years, but gave Tresemme shampoo and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I know several people have stated that they don’t need to use conditioner with this shampoo, and that may be true.  </li>
            <li>TRESemme states that \\&quot;Different textures of hair are able to absorb different product</li>
            <li>High quality stuff here.</li>
            <li>She highly recommends the TRESemme shampoo.</li>
            <li>She highly recommends this product</li>
            <li>TRESemme Moisture Rich Shampoo is made for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s touted as a salon-quality product at a modest price, and it certainly seems to live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Tresemme does the job perfectly, nice thick shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair feels good to the touch (neither stripped to the point where it is squeaky nor too thickly coated) and falls properly into style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is gray and tends to have dry ends, even more since letting it grow long and having it relaxed.</li>
            <li>so much so that now the quality of my hair has made it near the top of my list of concerns, I have tried every shampoo I could find for dry hair--including another TreSemme product which comes in a similar bottles with blue instead of gold markings.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it lathered easily and that not much shampoo was necessary to lather all of my hair.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used TRESemme products in the past, and this is just as good as the other products in their line.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and clean - it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>So far TreSemme has worked out well.</li>
            <li>The sun is hot all year long.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It works like a professional shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, even hours after using it, my hair is soft to the touch and not one stray frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and I have not needed to use a conditioner every time I shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, thinning hair and have to be careful not to use products that weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is that thick, rich, and creamy!</li>
            <li>And importantly for a hydrating shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighted down, as can happen with similar products.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary if you have long or very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>When I unpacked the tall, black, plastic bottle I was more than a little surprised by the size and weight of the thing!</li>
            <li>After just one use, the shampoo left the hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Giving it 5 stars would be worth it compared to other mid level products.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thin textured and oily, you may be able to get away with just shampooing....</li>
            <li>The added moisture that this shampoo puts in my hair helps it go from dry to normal shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>We are not sure if it is really better than any other shampoo</li>
            <li>A shampoo that does not dry out my hair!</li>
            <li>This Moisture Rich shampoo by TRESamme, contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which is less harsh than Sodium Laurel Sulfate, but can still be drying to some types of hair, especially when the product is used</li>

            <li> My hair is gray and tends to have dry ends, even more since letting it grow long and having it relaxed.</li>
            <li> so much so that now the quality of my hair has made it near the top of my list of concerns, I have tried every shampoo I could find for dry hair--including another TreSemme product which comes in a similar bottles with blue instead of gold markings.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it lathered easily and that not much shampoo was necessary to lather all of my hair.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used TRESemme products in the past, and this is just as good as the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny and clean - it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> So far TreSemme has worked out well.</li>
            <li> The sun is hot all year long.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> It works like a professional shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, even hours after using it, my hair is soft to the touch and not one stray frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and I have not needed to use a conditioner every time I shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, thinning hair and have to be careful not to use products that weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is that thick, rich, and creamy!</li>
            <li> And importantly for a hydrating shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighted down, as can happen with similar products.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary if you have long or very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> When I unpacked the tall, black, plastic bottle I was more than a little surprised by the size and weight of the thing!</li>
            <li> After just one use, the shampoo left the hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Giving it 5 stars would be worth it compared to other mid level products.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin textured and oily, you may be able to get away with just shampooing....</li>
            <li> The added moisture that this shampoo puts in my hair helps it go from dry to normal shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> We are not sure if it is really better than any other shampoo</li>
            <li> A shampoo that does not dry out my hair!</li>
            <li> This Moisture Rich shampoo by TRESamme, contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which is less harsh than Sodium Laurel Sulfate, but can still be drying to some types of hair, especially when the product is used</li>
            <li> I need very little of this shampoo to do my whole head which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry short hair, with some grey ones mixed in that are even coarser.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo cleaned my hair and did not leave it flat.  </li>
            <li> This is without using oil or a flat iron, too.</li>
            <li> I also like that I get far less flyaway and frizzy hair moments using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and dry and even when I put Moroccan oil on it and flat ironing my hair, it only lasts for a few hours before the electrified</li>
            <li> And then that combined with the fact that I have hard water, means I have to rinse much longer to get all the shampoo out of my hair.</li>
            <li> main ingredients are the same in other shampoos, so I saw no reason, for my shampooing purposes, to wash my hair as usual, wet hair, lather, rinse, lather again, and rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and the moisture stays in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wash and blow dry</li>

            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Nexxus an excellent shampoo, but expensive and had mixabilty issues where the product would separate a little between the shampoo and the moisturizer base by the time you got half way down on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The hair that grew during that time has become extremely dry, stiff, and brittle.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at least daily and with waist length hair</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT feel softer, less tangled or shinier after use.</li>
            <li> so it is slightly curly to cover balding spots.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, I felt so bad that I really didn&#x27;t care about hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> After I rinsed it out, I saw that my hair did not feel at all dried out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and supple. It really does moisturize, cleans great and has a low, subtle odor to it which is just wonderful. High quality stuff here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo about 2-3 times.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, rinses out easily, and leave my hair feeling clean.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in me hair&#x27;s dryness, though, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is ok but nothing great. The shampoo is rich and thick, but I find I have to use more than other shampoos in order to get a good lather. And then that combined with the fact that I have hard water, means I have to rinse much longer to get all the shampoo out of my hair. My hair does NOT feel softer, less tangled or shinier after use. So overall, this shampoo doesn’t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday and I need a shampoo that will not dry out my hair.  So far I have been using TreSemme Moisture Rich shampoo has worked out very well.  It works up to a nice lather when washing your hair and rinses out cleanly, leaving no residue or film.  I did not need to use a moisturizer to take the tangles out as my comb glided smoothly through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is easy to manage, is not dry or brittle.  I blow dry my hair and the moisture stays in my hair.  So far TreSemme has worked out well.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad experience with a TRESemme product. These leaves my hair softer and smoother than any expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> This moisture rich clean scented shampoo is perfect for daily use as it adds moisture and shine with silky softness without weighing my hair down. The vitamin E helps keep my hair shiny and I had less frizz overall. The price is great per ounce but beware the bottle is heavy and unwieldy when trying to get the product out and I prefer bottles that open from the bottom for that reason as they&#x27;re easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I love trying new hair products and this is a good one.  I have fine, straight, thinning hair and have to be careful not to use products that weigh my hair down.  This shampoo cleaned my hair and did not leave it flat.  I alternate using different shampoos on the advice of my hairdresser, and this will be added to my shampoo collection.  My husband also used it and like it.  It is a big bottle of shampoo for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used TRESemme shampoo. When I unpacked the tall, black, plastic bottle I was more than a little surprised by the size and weight of the thing! 28 whopping ounces; a very generous quantity at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is only wonderful if the shampoo \\&quot;works\\&quot; for your type of hair. I decided to go on the TRESemme web site and take the short \\&quot;Hair PROfiler\\&quot; quiz easily located on the home page. TRESemme states that \\&quot;Different textures of hair are able to absorb different product densities.\\&quot; My hair texture is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, my cursed-problems are frizz and flyaways, I wash my hair about 2x a week, color treat my highlighted blond hair, I desire volume, and I style using heat. Low and behold, based on my answers to their questions, Moisture Rich was one of three shampoos recommended for me! (Also recommended was Platinum Strength, and Keratin Infusing formulas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to stay away from shampoos that contain Sulfates. For the most part, I use the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure/Strong/Moist line of shampoos and conditioners. I find them to be the most gentle and I get good results. This Moisture Rich shampoo by TRESamme, contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which is less harsh than Sodium Laurel Sulfate, but can still be drying to some types of hair, especially when the product is used every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo about 8 times now. It lathers profusely (thanks to the Laureth Sulfate), has a nice, non-cloying floral/fruity aroma, and cleaned my hair and scalp extremely well without the need to shampoo/rinse/repeat. I always followed the shampoo with whatever conditioner was at hand (not by TRESamme.) My hair needs more conditioning than provided just by using this shampoo. If your hair is thin textured and oily, you may be able to get away with just shampooing....I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? My hair is manageable, soft, and easy to style. The shampoo does not strip the moisture from the hair, at least when used twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality shampoo that is extremely reasonably priced.  A good choice for the whole family.used twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality shampoo that is extremely reasonably priced.  A good choice for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Works for any kind of hair. Simple all in one shampoo, leaves the hair smooth and shiny every day. I am not a big fan of having a bottle for shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer etc on a day to day basis.  Tresemme does the job perfectly, nice thick shampoo and I dont have to use a lot to get the hair clean.  Simple one bottle solution, makes every day life easier.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the smell.  This has a scent that is not overwhelming, but stays with you all day.  The added moisture that this shampoo puts in my hair helps it go from dry to normal shiny hair.  To be honest I swap out shampoos every bottle to prevent build-up, so there is no “normal” shampoo for me.  I do think that this will enter the regular rotation.  I love how soft my hair feels.  I know several people have stated that they don’t need to use conditioner with this shampoo, and that may be true.  I continued using a moisturizing conditioner with this shampoo just because I dread the lack of conditioner.  I would recommend this for people who don’t want to spend salon money but want a good quality, nice smelling moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at least daily and with waist length hair I go through a lot of shampoo. This hits the right balance between clean and over-stripped; my hair is left soft and clean. I like the scent which is not overpowering. I need very little of this shampoo to do my whole head which is a big plus. At such a terrific price point, I&#x27;d definitely buy this on a regular basis. Great value. I also like that I get far less flyaway and frizzy hair moments using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> In Florida, hair is exposed to harsh elements. The sun is hot all year long. Humidity adds frizz. The damage is moreso for those that spend a lot of time outdoors. TRESemme Moisture Rich Shampoo is made for dry or damaged hair. It was created with women in mind, but the scent and quality of this shampoo make it appropriately unisex. Even two days later, my hair felt clean and smelled good. The moisture and repair claims may be overstated, but this shampoo will get the job done, use a leave-in conditioner for added benefits.</li>
            <li> The suggested directions list four steps.  1) Coat hair with a liberal amount of shampoo.  2) Gently massage the scalp and roots with fingertips to work into a lather.  3) Lightly squeeze the shampoo from roots to ends and rinse thoroughly.  4)  Finish with…a conditioner….and style with styling aids as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This part of a regimen, and wetting the hair isn’t included in the directions as on the label of every other shampoo I’ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredients are the same in other shampoos, so I saw no reason, for my shampooing purposes, to wash my hair as usual, wet hair, lather, rinse, lather again, and rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinning.  I have it cut so it is slightly curly to cover balding spots.  This shampoo, as I use it, seems to leave my hair feeling thicker, which, of course, I like.  Also, there is a foamy lather, also to my liking.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  We are not sure if it is really better than any other shampoo but it does a good job.  Not really sure if it is 4 times moisturizing but our hair is doing well with it.  The scent is subtle.  Overall there is nothing to brag about but there is also nothing to complain about.  Would buy again for the right price.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry short hair, with some grey ones mixed in that are even coarser.  I wash and blow dry daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works well for me in our rather hard water.  My hair feels good to the touch (neither stripped to the point where it is squeaky nor too thickly coated) and falls properly into style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;ve had even better results with high end shampoos at four times the price, but this stuff is great for the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable. I noticed that it does not lather as well as some other Tresemme shampoos. I prefer volumizing shampoo for my own hair, but this would be great for someone who needs something a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> TRESemme Shampoo, Moisture Rich 28 oz bottle is good product. Overall, we are happy with it. Rating it was a tad tough. Giving it 5 stars would be worth it compared to other mid level products. However, this product isn&#x27;t the best shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoyed this shampoo. She says it makes her scalp feel great and makes her hair manageable and soft. I believe her as her gorgeous brown hair has never looked better.  She highly recommends the TRESemme shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo. It leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean and hydrated. And importantly for a hydrating shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighted down, as can happen with similar products. I recommend this to anyone with dry hair who&#x27;s looking for a good hydrating shampoo.</li>
            <li> Rich, sumptuous hair.  That is what we all want and this shampoo helps you achieve it.  It looks like a conditioner out of the bottle.  I was skeptical at first but when I tried it... wow.</li>
            <li> This shampoo claims to be 4x moisturizing - and it really is.  My wife used this shampoo and found she did not need to use a conditioner. She said it was more like a two-in-one product, with shampoo and conditioner in one bottle.  I should add the disclaimer that she has a short hairstyle.  Your mileage may vary if you have long or very damaged hair. Besides the convenience of not having to use a conditioner, you also save money. And, the scent is very nice - kind of like fresh fruit.  She highly recommends this product</li>
            <li> I was very sick a year ago and took many medications for about 8 months. The hair that grew during that time has become extremely dry, stiff, and brittle. It looks as if I over processed it with heat appliances so that it looks burned and stiff. In addition, a lot fell out and is growing back in gray and curly. For a long time, I felt so bad that I really didn&#x27;t care about hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m better, so much so that now the quality of my hair has made it near the top of my list of concerns, I have tried every shampoo I could find for dry hair--including another TreSemme product which comes in a similar bottles with blue instead of gold markings. Nothing worked very well, so when I decided to try this one my expectations were not high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, this one IS different. It does soften my hair so I can style it and manage it to tuck under instead of having it stick out like a straw broom. The texture has improved as well, it feels closer to what my hair used to feel like. Between the shampoo and a sort of serum I use to keep down the new growth that use to stick out like static, I feel pretty presentable.  I use it every three days and I let it air dry. I am, honestly, delighted. Once all my damaged hair grows out, I think I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Tresame seems to be a non-drying shampoo. The advertisement for it says it locks moisture into the hair shafts, and that was my experience. When I poured it out, I noticed its clean and light scent. When I started lathering this shampoo into my hair, I had to look at the bottle to make sure it was not a conditioner. The shampoo is that thick, rich, and creamy! I noticed that it lathered easily and that not much shampoo was necessary to lather all of my hair. After I rinsed it out, I saw that my hair did not feel at all dried out. It felt as if I had used conditioner! This was a first! So I skipped using conditioner, something I never do, to see what would result. After my hair was dry, it was even easier to work with than it is when I use a conditioner! It seemed to be softer and shinier, too. I am impressed! A shampoo that does not dry out my hair! I also noticed that this shampoo is not at all expensive. It is one of the least expensive shampoos I have ever tried! This is the shampoo for me!</li>
            <li> This TRESemme Shampoo works great. It was so smooth and easy to apply. It works like a professional shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how it leaves the hair. After just one use, the shampoo left the hair very soft and manageable. It also helps to cut back on the hair being frizzy.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo made by Unilever that also make Nexxus, Dove, St.Ives shampoos. I have used Nexxus and Dove. And I just started using TRESemme moisture recently. Big price differences between Unilever&#x27;s shampoos and TRESemme being the cheapest in my opinion is also the best. The Dove is very good, but the smell was a little overpowering and smells like a woman&#x27;s product and it seems to have to much conditioner/moisturizer  in it. Nexxus an excellent shampoo, but expensive and had mixabilty issues where the product would separate a little between the shampoo and the moisturizer base by the time you got half way down on the bottle. Not knocking Nexxus, but the TRESemme does the same thing Performance wise as the Nexxus , it has a much better and milder smell to it with no mixability issues. $3.88 for 28oz. Nexxus is like $17 for 32 oz and the Dove is like $5 for 28oz. TRESEMME for the win!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how soft this has made my hair. My hair is naturally curly and dry and even when I put Moroccan oil on it and flat ironing my hair, it only lasts for a few hours before the electrified frizzies start showing up at the top of my head. So far, even hours after using it, my hair is soft to the touch and not one stray frizzy hair. This is without using oil or a flat iron, too. Just the TRESemme shampoo and nothing else. I can tell you, the label is true to its name - it is moisture rich. I cannot stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day - my roots tend to be oily while my ends tend to be try. I have fine hair that I&#x27;ve colored for years and I have also some sections of my hair that are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this shampoo did a nice job. My dry ends and dry section looked good. My hair was shiny and clean - it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and quality of this shampoo, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of TRESemme products so I decided to give their shampoo a trial run and I am very happy with the results.  It does all the things I want in a good shampoo: nice rich lather, smells good, leaves my hair super clean.  I will be buying this again and also trying the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Aussie Moist shampoo for at least 12 years, but gave Tresemme shampoo and was very pleased. My hair is gray and tends to have dry ends, even more since letting it grow long and having it relaxed. The dryness was something Aussie Moist helped control, but I found the Tresemme Moist Rich Shampoo worked very well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave my hair feeling dry or straw-like and there&#x27;s tons of lather. It rinses out well and smells very pleasant. My hair feels soft and I have not needed to use a conditioner every time I shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the present price of under $6 for 28oz, it is a great product at a great price. Not sure if I&#x27;ll stop using Aussie Moist...but I am tempted.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for dry or color-treated hair. It has a rich, creamy lather and is gentle on the hair and scalp. It&#x27;s touted as a salon-quality product at a modest price, and it certainly seems to live up to the hype. It leaves hair soft and manageable when used with a small amount of conditioner. We&#x27;ve used TRESemme products in the past, and this is just as good as the other products in their line.</li>
