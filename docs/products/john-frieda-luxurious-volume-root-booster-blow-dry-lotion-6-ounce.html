            <li>It gives amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s a good quick fix for those times when you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo, spray again,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than another product I am using.  </li>
            <li>This works OK</li>
            <li>Its OK it does what it says</li>
            <li>and I have tried MANY products.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Seems to add a bit more volume than most.</li>
            <li>I have ordered more JF products with optimistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>rub it through your hair, use the hot air brush styler, and you are good to go again.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This does nothing for fine hair, except make it even more staticky &amp; fly-away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I got a fair amount of volume increase at the roots but nothing to really rave about.</li>
            <li>Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Frieda products which help produce volume in fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>This product did not produce any added volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have fine hair and any noticeable increase is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Gives the volume I need for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, but use it only if you have the time to let it work before drying.</li>
            <li>I can go days (like 4-5) without washing my hair thanks to this stuff, because my hair stays full and smooth without getting oily or stringy!</li>
            <li>I love the added fullness I get with this product, but I had to experiment with it to find out how to get the most lasting body for my hair.  </li>
            <li>One of many products I&#x27;ve tried to add volume, and it seems to work sometimes better than others, depending on how clean my hair is, how much other product I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li>product (shampoo, conditioner and root booster and hair spray) in the Luxurious line for fine hair is specifically designed to be &amp;#34;weightless&amp;#34; and to bring the desired volume to my otherwise perpetually straight lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and perfectly straight with no body.  </li>
            <li>but I think its worth the time to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is possible that I may have used too much of a good thing  in regard to this product, but I just didn&#x27;t like the drying residue left though it did do a good job uplifting my usually flat hair.</li>
            <li>It makes a great deal of difference in my longish, fine hair and gives me the full, but casual look I always wanted.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the results which last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>I used this product with the JF hot air brush and saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>you will get the most volume possible.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, especially that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy, or like there is even product in it.</li>
            <li>It is a simple process.&lt;br /&gt;It does a fairly good job providing volume, but I found it left a lacquer feeling residue at the root line.</li>
            <li>I love how much volume it gives my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to have more shine, maybe due to the protection factor and yet my hair retains the softness and manageableity I want .</li>
            <li>I am a fan of John Frieda products but this spray does nothing for my normal straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better products I have used on my fine, thin hair.....</li>
            <li>I have very fine , limp , hair but</li>
            <li>It gives me a little more volume, without added weight or stickiness.</li>
            <li>and it has the benefit of protection for fragil or mature hair !!</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning and most products are heavy and make my hair  look oily.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair and this is my personal miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Much as I like the John Frieda line of products, this is one that seemed like it would hold a lot of promise for my fine limp</li>
            <li>This styling spray with a blow dry with a hot styling brush really adds body and lift to my hair.  </li>
            <li>But since this is the only thing that has worked for me, I am willing to forgo the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have been a lover of John Frieda root booster sprays for awhile but tried this one for the first time several weeks ago.</li>
            <li>hair- wont do anything but be straight and flat.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much of it or it will make your hair go flat.</li>

            <li> using this product allows me to grow my hair a little longer</li>

            <li> Not sure why that is so......</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not thrilled but haven&#x27;t finished giving it a chance yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying $20+ for Matrix root lifter, and this is much less expensive and works as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a root-boosting product that would give me some volume without &amp;#34;mushroom hair&amp;#34; but this is a miracle product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying $20+ for Matrix root lifter, and this is much less expensive and works as well.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Products: Luxurious Volume ACTUALLY work!&lt;br /&gt; I am very pleased with the Frieda products which help produce volume in fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Each product (shampoo, conditioner and root booster and hair spray) in the Luxurious line for fine hair is specifically designed to be &amp;#34;weightless&amp;#34; and to bring the desired volume to my otherwise perpetually straight lifeless hair.  The video  gives tips for getting the maximum style and volume from each product. I am extremely pleased with the results which last throughout the day. Thank you John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and most products are heavy and make my hair  look oily. This product does exactly as it says. My hair lifts from my scalp and makes it look fuller.</li>
            <li> This product did not produce any added volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It gives me a little more volume, without added weight or stickiness.</li>
            <li> The product was wrapped in plastic. It the liquid had leaked all over, even on the bottom of the mailbox it arrived in!!  I contacted the manufacturer and they asked for a photo which would not have helped.  The product itself. Ok.</li>
            <li> Love this product !! Bought it the first time on clearance , checked Amazon, great price and delivered to my door !! I have very fine , limp , hair but using this product allows me to grow my hair a little longer and it has the benefit of protection for fragil or mature hair !! My hair seems to have more shine, maybe due to the protection factor and yet my hair retains the softness and manageableity I want . It&#x27;s my go to product now !! Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thin/fine hair- wont do anything but be straight and flat. I used this product with the JF hot air brush and saw a noticeable difference. Noticeable to me anyway.. didn&#x27;t give me the volume of my dreams but I think its worth the time to use it. :) great price as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I got a fair amount of volume increase at the roots but nothing to really rave about. That being said, I have fine hair and any noticeable increase is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now. I have short fine hair and this is my personal miracle worker. Don&#x27;t use too much of it or it will make your hair go flat. Just a little bit at the roots.</li>
            <li> One of many products I&#x27;ve tried to add volume, and it seems to work sometimes better than others, depending on how clean my hair is, how much other product I&#x27;ve used, yada yada - bottom line, I&#x27;m not thrilled but haven&#x27;t finished giving it a chance yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this item hoping to get some volume in my hair, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference. I will not get it again.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well for the price!! I love how much volume it gives my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added this to Amazon orders several times. It works well on my hair.  I find it&#x27;s a good quick fix for those times when you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo, spray again, rub it through your hair, use the hot air brush styler, and you are good to go again.  It does need heat to make it work best.</li>
            <li> I love the added fullness I get with this product, but I had to experiment with it to find out how to get the most lasting body for my hair.  If you dry your hair immediately after spraying it on you will get little to moderate results.  If you wait 10-15 minutes until the spray dries some and THEN blow dry you will get the most volume possible.  The added volume and shape lasts until you wash it out, which for me is 3-4 days.  It makes a great deal of difference in my longish, fine hair and gives me the full, but casual look I always wanted.  Great stuff, but use it only if you have the time to let it work before drying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works any better than another product I am using.  It does add a bit of volume.</li>
            <li> This works OK but I feel like it leaves my hair feeling sticky or &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; like afterwards. Its OK it does what it says but I don&#x27;t like the texture in my hair personally.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products I have used on my fine, thin hair.....and I have tried MANY products. The only way this works for me though is to spray when damp, scrunch....do NOT blow dry and then use a curling iron when dry. . If I use the dryer on it, my hair is as limp as ever. Not sure why that is so......But since this is the only thing that has worked for me, I am willing to forgo the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore but I love it. It adds lots of volume without being stiff or crumbly. Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have been a lover of John Frieda root booster sprays for awhile but tried this one for the first time several weeks ago. I am hooked. I have thin, limp hair and this stuff gives me amazing volume that lasts all day and well into the next day. I do use this product in conjunction with the luxurious volume shampoo and conditioner and also blow dry my hair upside down. It also smells lovely. Definitely give this a try!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, especially that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy, or like there is even product in it. I can run my fingers through my hair all day long and it still keeps its volume. I can go days (like 4-5) without washing my hair thanks to this stuff, because my hair stays full and smooth without getting oily or stringy!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Seems to add a bit more volume than most.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for fine hair, except make it even more staticky &amp; fly-away.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Could have bought something just as good and cheaper in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Love this! I was skeptical about a root-boosting product that would give me some volume without &amp;#34;mushroom hair&amp;#34; but this is a miracle product.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of John Frieda products but this spray does nothing for my normal straight hair.  I gave it to friend with curly thicker hair and she said it didn&#x27;t do anything for her hair.</li>
            <li> Much as I like the John Frieda line of products, this is one that seemed like it would hold a lot of promise for my fine limp hair.&lt;br /&gt;Usage couldn&#x27;t be simpler. Wash and condition your hair and then towel dry your hair. Apply the root booster to the hair at the roots and then style/blow dry. It is a simple process.&lt;br /&gt;It does a fairly good job providing volume, but I found it left a lacquer feeling residue at the root line. Since I prefer Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume Mousse to this product that is now my go to product for volume.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that I may have used too much of a good thing  in regard to this product, but I just didn&#x27;t like the drying residue left though it did do a good job uplifting my usually flat hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used for fine thinning hair. I divide hair and spray at the roots and then clip up and let hair air dry. It gives amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and perfectly straight with no body.  This styling spray with a blow dry with a hot styling brush really adds body and lift to my hair.  I have ordered more JF products with optimistic expectations.  Currently, I finish styling with Fruitus anti-humidity pump hair spray for a style that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Gives the volume I need for my fine hair.</li>
