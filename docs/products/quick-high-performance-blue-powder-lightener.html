            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a 40 strength developer, too, of course, so keep that in mind if you decide to use it. :)</li>
            <li>I will have to tone it to get out the yellow tones but the lift was perfect.</li>
            <li>better off buying the tub though.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering another 2 packets and more developer to finish off the process after 3 weeks of letting the hair rest.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li>Worked well and left the clients hair in good condition !</li>
            <li>Package was ripped but came in quickly</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased that I could find it at a decent price here.</li>
            <li>The bleached portions look great, almost white (which is actually the color of my &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34;), healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>If mixed and applied correctly, the colors come out nicely.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid fifties, with 100% gray, shoulder length, very fine and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what I want, though.</li>
            <li>I love it, works instantly !</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read the description better because I was expecting an actual container of it.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>I used this with the 40 bleach and it made it 10x as light, but if you want to use this for your full hair get another packet, just one isnt enough.</li>
            <li>Color stayed dark and it didnt do much for the lightning at all, it was shipped really fast and got it fine, so dealer was fine but product blows.</li>
            <li>I have dyed black hair and this stripped the color nicely.</li>
            <li>Quick Blue is one of the few products that has good results pretty much every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would for sure use this product again, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair either !</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve dyed it purple, teal, blue, bright pink (twice), and a mixture of those colors for no reason than to use up the rest of my hair dye.</li>
            <li>This bleach powder/lightener works very well.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>My hair turned out to be a little dry and bright yellow/orange, but it&#x27;s already super processed</li>
            <li>I was able to do two treatments (one 40 min and the second 15 min) and I am getting pretty close to a white blond.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean blonde no brass.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a lightener that works, Quick Blue is it!</li>
            <li>Love the bleach got my hair a whitish blonde but still tones of yellow</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic but be careful when bleaching your hair yourself.</li>
            <li>I mixed one ounce of the quick blue with about the same amount of salon cares 30 volume developer till the consistency was creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was able to go pale blond, like loreal paris 03</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because there are times I need more than one package, but that&#x27;s not really all that abnormal for hair bleach, especially on darker hair.</li>
            <li>I only had to bleach my hair once for it to be light blonde</li>
            <li>Its a fabulous bleach and one I plan to use if I ever decide to continue the green and grey residing on my head right now</li>
            <li>but as it dried it reveled itself to be a very light yellowy blonde!</li>
            <li>It left my hair orange but that was to be expected I went over it with ASH blonde dye and it neutralized Most of The Brass tones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair pink or red before, known for being hard to get out, and this has dealt with it surprisingly well twice now.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about bleaching the dye out myself as I have VERY fragile hair, but a professional colorist wanted $600 to do the lift and color.  </li>
            <li>Used this to get my hair ready for pink c:</li>
            <li>Okay when i first bleached my hair I had it dyed blue green and purple with about half an inch of my dark brown roots.</li>
            <li>As a stylist I generally use this stuff only on myself but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Because I have dark brown (close to black) hair, I need to bleach my hair first if I intend to achieve a vibrant hair color.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good price and product will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bleach powder every time I decided to color my hair. Because I have dark brown (close to black) hair, I need to bleach my hair first if I intend to achieve a vibrant hair color. This bleach powder/lightener works very well. I tend to mix it with  Salon Care 30 Volume Creme Developer since I have thick hair. I don&#x27;t use a 40 Volume Creme Developer because I think it would be too strong/bad for my hair. If mixed and applied correctly, the colors come out nicely.</li>
            <li> all my hair fell out dont buy</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It lightens my hair at a fraction of the cost then a salon.</li>
            <li> The best bleach I have ever used! It&#x27;s fast acting, but at the same time doesn&#x27;t damaged your hair too badly. I was able to do two treatments (one 40 min and the second 15 min) and I am getting pretty close to a white blond. I have dyed black hair and this stripped the color nicely. I would definitely buy this if you wanna go blonde but still want some hair left.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, great packaging. Be careful with this bleach, it will damage your hair if not used correctly! I recommend no higher than a 30 volume developer. This product is fantastic but be careful when bleaching your hair yourself.</li>
            <li> Package was ripped but came in quickly</li>
            <li> Worked well and left the clients hair in good condition !</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly, very effective product.</li>
            <li> This did not work in my hair. I have darker hair so that may be why.</li>
            <li> I used this along with Salon Care 30 Volume Creme Developer to dye my hair platinum blonde. It worked perfectly. I made the mistake of trying another product and didn&#x27;t get the same results. Therefore, I will stick with what works the best. If you&#x27;re looking for a lightener that works, Quick Blue is it!</li>
            <li> It did all it could be expected to do bleach only takes your hair down a maximum 4 shades at a time. It left my hair orange but that was to be expected I went over it with ASH blonde dye and it neutralized Most of The Brass tones</li>
            <li> As a stylist I generally use this stuff only on myself but it gets the job done. The quality isnt bad &amp; its been my go to product for at home use for years.</li>
            <li> Perfect results for getting Ariana Grandes highlights and color it was awesome didnt sting and wasnt so damaging as others. AAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for when I need to blast the ever-loving dark brown out of my hair. My natural hair color ranges from a chestnut brown to almost black and I&#x27;ve dyed it purple, teal, blue, bright pink (twice), and a mixture of those colors for no reason than to use up the rest of my hair dye. I&#x27;ve had my hair bleached at a salon - went terribly and I had to be there for three hours - and I&#x27;ve tried to use regular blonders/lighteners to disappointing affect. Quick Blue is one of the few products that has good results pretty much every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because there are times I need more than one package, but that&#x27;s not really all that abnormal for hair bleach, especially on darker hair. This does exactly what I want, though. It blasts color out of my hair and it does it in almost no time flat. I&#x27;ve had my hair pink or red before, known for being hard to get out, and this has dealt with it surprisingly well twice now. I use it with a 40 strength developer, too, of course, so keep that in mind if you decide to use it. :)</li>
            <li> excellant transaction and price very satisfied</li>
            <li> My hair turned out to be a little dry and bright yellow/orange, but it&#x27;s already super processed so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Fast delivery and good product.✨👏🏻</li>
            <li> This works really well but I bleached my hair four times and this was definitely not enough so I suggest going with a pound if you need a lot of bleach</li>
            <li> I have black hair, and when I used this with 30 level developer it ended up a dark blonde. I had hoped for a lighter blonde.</li>
            <li> I expected that I would have to bleach my hair twice but I was wrong! I mixed one ounce of the quick blue with about the same amount of salon cares 30 volume developer till the consistency was creamy and smooth. Left it on a chunk of my virgin hair for about 45 min. When I rinsed it out it looked orange (as I expected it to,) but as it dried it reveled itself to be a very light yellowy blonde! I will have to tone it to get out the yellow tones but the lift was perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it, works instantly ! I would for sure use this product again, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair either ! The only downfall is that the size of the product I would recommend buying two, instead of one! Oh and don&#x27;t forget to buy the Developer that goes with the product.</li>
            <li> good! better off buying the tub though.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for the amount I get. I guess I should have read the description better because I was expecting an actual container of it. This is enough to bleach my hair once. Not suggested for people who are going to bleach it multiple times to go blonde.</li>
            <li> ive tried this on many didnt textures of hair and it did an amazing job...i love it. great great great</li>
            <li> This Powder Lightener works wonders! I have really dark brown hair and it makes my hair platinum blonde. I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> If you have shoulder-length [black Indian] hair, one packet may not be enough. Try two or three to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I could do were my bangs and a little in the back.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid fifties, with 100% gray, shoulder length, very fine and curly hair.  I have been coloring it dark brown for a couple of years trying to stave off the gray.  With the maintenance involved, I&#x27;ve decided to strip out the dye and let the gray have its way.  I was apprehensive about bleaching the dye out myself as I have VERY fragile hair, but a professional colorist wanted $600 to do the lift and color.  I read reviews and purchased one package of this plus a 30 strength soy developer, a purple toner and after color conditioner.  I quartered my hair up and started the application.  By the third quarter of the hair, I had run out of the mixture.  As a result I have partially white/partially red hair.  I&#x27;m ordering another 2 packets and more developer to finish off the process after 3 weeks of letting the hair rest.  However, I must say, the damage was absolutely minimal.  The bleached portions look great, almost white (which is actually the color of my &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34;), healthy and shiny.  I can&#x27;t wait to finish the process and not have to worry about dyeing my hair ever again!</li>
            <li> Gives a clean blonde no brass.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works well. If you know what you&#x27;re doing and know how to use this, get it. It works.</li>
            <li> Okay when i first bleached my hair I had it dyed blue green and purple with about half an inch of my dark brown roots. My hair is a short 1.5 in pixie cut with maybe 5 in bangs. I was able to go pale blond, like loreal paris 03 blond with one small packet and still have a dab left over which yes is usable. and my hair didnt go all brassy on me. Its a fabulous bleach and one I plan to use if I ever decide to continue the green and grey residing on my head right now</li>
            <li> Great bleach. Gets out very dark hair color. Turns yellowish blonde with very dark brown hair at 45 minutes. Only bleach I use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I was so pleased that I could find it at a decent price here.</li>
            <li> Love the bleach got my hair a whitish blonde but still tones of yellow</li>
            <li> Awesome! Used this to get my hair ready for pink c:</li>
            <li> Color stayed dark and it didnt do much for the lightning at all, it was shipped really fast and got it fine, so dealer was fine but product blows.</li>
            <li> I used this with the 40 bleach and it made it 10x as light, but if you want to use this for your full hair get another packet, just one isnt enough.</li>
            <li> probably the best hair bleach I&#x27;ve ever used I only had to bleach my hair once for it to be light blonde and I had dark brown hair</li>
