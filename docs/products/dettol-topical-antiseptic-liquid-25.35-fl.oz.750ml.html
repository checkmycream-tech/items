            <li>Hope it can be useful!</li>
            <li>It is as well known dettol.&lt;br /&gt;I received on time and original compound.</li>
            <li>The pine smell is so clean and evokes a smell which lasts around the house.  </li>
            <li>I found that when I tattoo I use dettol to clean all of my equipment along.</li>

            <li>it is a good product for daily use and hygiene.</li>
            <li>Good to use it in public laudary</li>
            <li>The only problem was it came unsealed; otherwise, everything is good.</li>
            <li>Good quality but the cap isn&#x27;t as my expected, anyway, its fine</li>
            <li>Luckily my family members have re-introduced me to Dettol.</li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s in there as an ingredient, however it really has a fresh healthy fragrance.</li>
            <li>I used to bring this back from England after a visit and now am thrilled I can find it in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li>I repeated the process a second time for good measure, and the miniatures turned out really well.  </li>
            <li>Just fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable using any other disinfectant because i&#x27;m confident in it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>gentle powerful antiseptic, must be diluted.</li>
            <li>Needs  to be at home as part of first aid stuff</li>
            <li>cleaning, because I read reviews of how great it is, but all that is on the back label is VERY minimal (like a line of info) about mixing it with water for wounds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as big as i imaged, but fine.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested me that this will get rid of roaches, but I don&#x27;t think it does that job very well to me.</li>
            <li>delivery and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>7 days a week all legal licensed by the state and county.</li>
            <li>SO FAST</li>
            <li>SO FAST</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>So the whole QUESTIONS?</li>
            <li>absolutely looooooooooove it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve liked this in the past, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>We add to clothes washer and even older towels that start to smell musty after one use no longer smell at all.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use it all the time and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Ms. Pamela Ann Walsh-Arkport, New York</li>
            <li>I now live on a horse farm in Oregon, and we take in rescues to heal and re-hab.</li>
            <li>Live it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>delivered a long time, but it&#x27;s useful when i got.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit strong to me.</li>
            <li>The smell of disinfectant is a little strong.</li>
            <li>Dettol is an antiseptic/disinfectant that has stood the test of time, but in the USA you can get the same sized product for less than half as much money from MediChest.com, and with free shipping if your total order is more than $75.</li>
            <li>All i do is get an old toner bottle (8-10oz) like neutrogena&#x27;s toners and i</li>
            <li>Dettol is good, but its priced way to expensive, you can find them in Indian grocery stores for cheaper price.</li>
            <li>(he was associated with the company, but a different product and knew what I was talking about) and said he would transfer me to the RIGHT number (third time is the charm??) and got a woman who said she had no idea WHY he transferred to her and</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheaper through Amazon by several thousand dollars than flying to England for a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I used it often in Indonesia, and I have hunted high and low for it since coming back to the states.</li>
            <li>Owned a Child Care Center for 15 years and started out with one child and word of mouth had my business growing fast.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give this item 4 stars is because it took damn near a month to egg here</li>
            <li>Since living in America I have strayed away from Dettol and started using some of the other more commercial soaps that are just a waste of time.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product for the purposes for which I used it, but I can&#x27;t speak to any other uses.  </li>
            <li>Some of these horses have appalling wounds and illness&#x27;s, so I have quite a challenge to keep everything clean and up to par.   </li>

            <li> The only reason I give this item 4 stars is because it took damn near a month to egg here</li>
            <li> Since living in America I have strayed away from Dettol and started using some of the other more commercial soaps that are just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product for the purposes for which I used it, but I can&#x27;t speak to any other uses.  </li>
            <li> Some of these horses have appalling wounds and illness&#x27;s, so I have quite a challenge to keep everything clean and up to par.   </li>
            <li> After this, I found that scrubbing the miniatures down with some Dr. Bronners liquid soap and an old toothbrush did wonders to get the paint</li>

            <li> If used correctly, goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because from the research I have done it is supposed to work well and has a long history.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because the active ingredients are the same as a product that grandparents always used.  </li>
            <li> Half cup in the bath daily.</li>
            <li> I truly believe we all should be using it especially with the H1N1 Flu and other Flues that our children and we come down with yearly.    </li>
            <li> Works great as a mosquito repellent, and dilute it down 10-1 with water - it goes a LONG way!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, a couple general things about Dettol: It has quite a distinct smell that I won&#x27;t say is terrible, but it certainly isn&#x27;t something that you want to take with you for days after using.  </li>
            <li> just a little bt goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I stopped wasting money on proactive and other pimple \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have seen online here and other places on the internet.  </li>
            <li> But the container was a little bit less than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use it too cleanse the area I am going to tattoo  and put my stenciles down on any area they are wanting a tat</li>
            <li> Go look for other sellers!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know any other product like it!</li>
            <li> I used Dettol to clean his room as I was afraid all the other cleaning products on the market would be irritating to him.  </li>
            <li> They will hover a few feet away...been using it for 2 year now and all my golf buddies carry little spray bottles with them for me to fill up each year...</li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;ll save the trouble of returning or whatever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but can&#x27;t find it</li>
            <li> Not easily found in stores</li>
            <li> But not sure if it will bleach clothes in those &amp;#34;he&amp;#34; washers.</li>
            <li> Too small for price.</li>
            <li> that even if I DID get someone in customer service for this product they would give me NO more info than what was on the bottle (which was mix with water for wounds).  </li>
            <li> but  quality is not very good</li>
            <li> No seal, no expiration date,i am so disappointed by this purchase,why there is no seal,how to know it is the real dettol????</li>
            <li> it is expensive, and delivery takes too long time</li>
            <li> It burns a little when using on face, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!!</li>
            <li> and it keeps flowing away slowly day after day.</li>
            <li> For any avid golfers that hate annoying gnats, buy this and put his on your cap and shoulders and</li>
            <li> Wrong bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I use this diluted as a mosquito and gnat repellent during those summer days when the pesky bugs are out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package is terrible, the bottle broke when it arrived and the liquid went everywhere in the box.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it for my clothes. Very good for disinfecting~</li>
            <li> Dettol is good, but its priced way to expensive, you can find them in Indian grocery stores for cheaper price.</li>
            <li> gentle powerful antiseptic, must be diluted. Very popular in England</li>
            <li> 100% great for home used, and for many other benefit</li>
            <li> it was damaged when it was delivered</li>
            <li> I grew up in Trinidad using Dettol soups and Anticeptics on a daily basis. Since living in America I have strayed away from Dettol and started using some of the other more commercial soaps that are just a waste of time. Luckily my family members have re-introduced me to Dettol.Not easily found in stores so I will be ordering quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Good quality but the cap isn&#x27;t as my expected, anyway, its fine</li>
            <li> Dettol is an antiseptic/disinfectant that has stood the test of time, but in the USA you can get the same sized product for less than half as much money from MediChest.com, and with free shipping if your total order is more than $75.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for daily use and hygiene. I would recommend all families prepare one for the family and do the regular sterilization.</li>
            <li> Dettol we use as antiseptic and its a good product. Needs  to be at home as part of first aid stuff</li>
            <li> Love this and so glad I can get it on Amazon. Before I had to by several in Barbados and lug them home. Now I can order what I need.</li>
            <li> A good antiseptic liquid for laundry or even to bathe with.</li>
            <li> I am from Canada and am happy to have found a way to buy it in the states!  I know it is advertised as an antiseptic but i use it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Being worrying about school public laundry, this would help with disinfection. But not sure if it will bleach clothes in those &amp;#34;he&amp;#34; washers.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested me that this will get rid of roaches, but I don&#x27;t think it does that job very well to me. However, it works great for cleaning!!!</li>
            <li> No seal, no expiration date,i am so disappointed by this purchase,why there is no seal,how to know it is the real dettol????</li>
            <li> Wrong bottle. I was looking for something to use with my clothes, not my skin. Anyway I&#x27;ll save the trouble of returning or whatever. Go look for other sellers!</li>
            <li> I grew up in England with this product.  It is absolutely amazing.  Nothing compares to it.  When my son was a baby and then a toddler and then a youth, he suffered from asthma and allergies.  I used Dettol to clean his room as I was afraid all the other cleaning products on the market would be irritating to him.  I used to bring this back from England after a visit and now am thrilled I can find it in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff Soon Buy More</li>
            <li> Authentic product&lt;br /&gt;speed delivery and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I like to put some with fabric softener while doing the laundry. feel safer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective in cleaning!!!!</li>
            <li> Owned a Child Care Center for 15 years and started out with one child and word of mouth had my business growing fast. It turned into 24 hrs. 7 days a week all legal licensed by the state and county. Dettol is what kept all of the children and workers healthy, as I used it for cleaning and found it in Canada and used to get it by the gallon concentrated, so it lasted for two years. This is the best product anyone can buy to keep healthy. I truly believe we all should be using it especially with the H1N1 Flu and other Flues that our children and we come down with yearly.    Ms. Pamela Ann Walsh-Arkport, New York</li>
            <li> Great ! I will get more of it.</li>
            <li> Dettol has been my family&#x27;s favorite antiseptic right from when i was a kid and i must say the quality of this product hasn&#x27;t changed a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable using any other disinfectant because i&#x27;m confident in it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Good to use it in public laudary</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strong to me.</li>
            <li> An excellent antiseptic has never been more satisfying than in the case of Dettol and thatâ€™s coming from someone who has been stocking disinfectants for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I love Dettol! I used it often in Indonesia, and I have hunted high and low for it since coming back to the states. It is honestly the best antiseptic that works well to combat my acne. I can not wait till it arrives!</li>
            <li> perfect.  As advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know since how long I know this product to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this for lot of purposes.</li>
            <li> I grew up with savlon and dettol and there are just no replacements for these two products that fill my expectations anywhere in the world. They are hands down the two best disinfectants out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;always have it around the house since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> The pine smell is so clean and evokes a smell which lasts around the house.  Does not stain counter tops either and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I use this diluted as a mosquito and gnat repellent during those summer days when the pesky bugs are out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!! Works Great!!!</li>
            <li> For any avid golfers that hate annoying gnats, buy this and put his on your cap and shoulders and some on your wrist and the gnats will not bother you on the golf course. They will hover a few feet away...been using it for 2 year now and all my golf buddies carry little spray bottles with them for me to fill up each year...gets me free beers all the time in gratitude...</li>
            <li> It was for my mother-in law</li>
            <li> I use it for all my cleaning...just a little bt goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love it! Half cup in the bath daily. We have the same product in Taiwan but not in US.</li>
            <li> this is the best de-synthesizer ever, very powerful and I don&#x27;t know any other product like it!******* ****** ***  **</li>
            <li> very good i always used that produce thats why i hunt for it thank you guys.</li>
            <li> it is expensive, and delivery takes too long time</li>
            <li> Good smelling that brought me the childhood memory.</li>
            <li> I purchased Dettol antiseptic liquid with what may be an uncommon purpose: to strip acrylic paint from plastic miniatures that I paint.  To that extent, it worked quite well.  I simply mixed one part Dettol with one part water and soaked the miniatures for 48 hours.  I repeated the process a second time for good measure, and the miniatures turned out really well.  After this, I found that scrubbing the miniatures down with some Dr. Bronners liquid soap and an old toothbrush did wonders to get the paint off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a couple general things about Dettol: It has quite a distinct smell that I won&#x27;t say is terrible, but it certainly isn&#x27;t something that you want to take with you for days after using.  I recommend that you use rubber gloves when handling this liquid.  Also, you should be prepared to give any surface that the Dettol touches a good scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for the purposes for which I used it, but I can&#x27;t speak to any other uses.  As I mentioned, the only negative aspect is the intense odor.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash clothes in the washing machine. Hope it can be useful! The smell of disinfectant is a little strong.</li>
            <li> My family and I have used Dettol for many years... We use it in multiple ways, and it has always been great.</li>
            <li> It is as well known dettol.&lt;br /&gt;I received on time and original compound.</li>
            <li> Leaves your home smelling great, fresh and clean sent for cleaning the whole house, kitchen,bathroom,floors and bedding in the wash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!!  All i do is get an old toner bottle (8-10oz) like neutrogena&#x27;s toners and i mix 15ml of dettol and fill the bottle with water.  My pimples disappear quickly!!  I stopped wasting money on proactive and other pimple \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  This by far is the CHEAPEST and MOST effective of them all!!  It burns a little when using on face, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!!</li>
            <li> SO FAST OMG OMG OMG I LOVE IT YES!!! SO SO SO SO FAST OH GOD YES YES YES YES !!!!</li>
            <li> Always a fan of it. I added it in the detergent when I wash my pets stuff.</li>
            <li> seems good. It does the work</li>
            <li> I found that when I tattoo I use dettol to clean all of my equipment along. With alcohol and. I use it too cleanse the area I am going to tattoo  and put my stenciles down on any area they are wanting a tat there are still the tattoo shops that use the speed stick deodorant but I like using dettol better</li>
            <li> Good product that could efficient to clean inside of wash machine,very useful.Good product that could efficient to clean inside of wash machine,very useful.</li>
            <li> I too grew up in England, where Dettol was a house hold staple. I now live on a horse farm in Oregon, and we take in rescues to heal and re-hab. Some of these horses have appalling wounds and illness&#x27;s, so I have quite a challenge to keep everything clean and up to par.   We use Dettol for cleaning wounds, stables, blankets and rugs...you name it, we use it. SO glad we can get it here now. Thanks..</li>
            <li> This is the best antiseptic solution of all times .... My wife and I use it all the time and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love the stuff! Smells like medicine but cleans well. We add to clothes washer and even older towels that start to smell musty after one use no longer smell at all. No medicine smell on clothes. Just fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t  be without this!</li>
            <li> Too small for price. Live it</li>
            <li> delivered a long time, but it&#x27;s useful when i got. Not as big as i imaged, but fine. Not that much cheap but excepted</li>
            <li> You want items cleaned and disinfected then this is  a must.  I learned of this product via people that come from islands like Jamaica and Trinidad.  This antiseptic is great.</li>
            <li> If used correctly, goes a LONG way. It smells very clean and is great to have around! I recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind the strong smell of pine oil.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love, this product!!. It does smell like pine tar, since it&#x27;s in there as an ingredient, however it really has a fresh healthy fragrance. It&#x27;s great in the bathroom,tub,toilet, floor. My favorite, laundry!!.I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it on a cut, but they say you can, just dilute. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll keep using it, you just know everything is clean.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a somewhat weaker formula than the original Dettol I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty satisfied though.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve liked this in the past, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Considering it came from England, delivery time was good.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this item 4 stars is because it took damn near a month to egg here but otherwise good quality. It&#x27;s a disinfectant. I think enough said</li>
            <li> a good thing to use when you have a ... roommate.&lt;br /&gt;The package is terrible, the bottle broke when it arrived and the liquid went everywhere in the box. and it keeps flowing away slowly day after day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and never found something here in the U.S. that equaled it.  And it&#x27;s cheaper through Amazon by several thousand dollars than flying to England for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great has Several uses.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of Dettol. Takes me back years. Excellent service delivered very quickly</li>
            <li> I say that because while I got the product, like the smell, I had the following experience with customer service when I called the QUESTIONS? number on the back of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID have questions as I got this as a disinfectant for laundry, cleaning, because I read reviews of how great it is, but all that is on the back label is VERY minimal (like a line of info) about mixing it with water for wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, called the number and got a recording telling me to call ANOTHER number, called THAT number and got a gentleman who said he had NO idea why it gave me his number (he was associated with the company, but a different product and knew what I was talking about) and said he would transfer me to the RIGHT number (third time is the charm??) and got a woman who said she had no idea WHY he transferred to her and that even if I DID get someone in customer service for this product they would give me NO more info than what was on the bottle (which was mix with water for wounds).  So the whole QUESTIONS? and a number on the back was a bit of a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I KNOW reviews are about the product itself, but I think of how to USE a product, having a customer service dept for it, counts so I am sharing this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES smell good like clean doctor or hospital smell I remember from decades ago.  I will use it in laundry based upon reviews and advice I have seen online here and other places on the internet.  Whether it will kill germs in cold water or exactly how much to use, how can I prove that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I gave it four stars because from the research I have done it is supposed to work well and has a long history.  Now if one could just reach the customer service dept for this product and actually get, well, information, that would be great.  IF they won&#x27;t give more than what is on the bottle, I don&#x27;t even know why there is a QUESTIONS? and a number listed.  It has warnings listed so if one had a problem with it, they would likely just say see your doctor or go to the emergency room anyway, so...point of the QUESTIONS? number?  I have no idea.st say see your doctor or go to the emergency room anyway, so...point of the QUESTIONS? number?  I have no idea.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. I don&#x27;t know why American stores do not sell it !!! it&#x27;s amazing for cleaning and Killing bacteria absolutely looooooooooove it</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, right product, smells great. The only problem was it came unsealed; otherwise, everything is good.</li>
            <li> I do not know whether it kill bacteria in clothes. I mixed it with Tide anyway. They seem to work together well.</li>
            <li> Nice original smell. I bought Dettol from another vendor and it smelled like varnish.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Will buy it again. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I use it in my laundry and also I keep a spray bottle for mopping the floor. Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Works great as a mosquito repellent, and dilute it down 10-1 with water - it goes a LONG way!!!!</li>
            <li> STOPS GNATS.  I bought it because the active ingredients are the same as a product that grandparents always used.  Three drops work for about 90 minutes.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Best gnat stuff around.</li>
            <li> Regular Dettol.  Grew up on this and still love the smell. I will purchase again because I do not want to be out of it..</li>
            <li> Great! The favor from childhood! But the container was a little bit less than I expected.</li>
            <li> ok for the price but  quality is not very good</li>
            <li> Have always been a regular using of dettol antiseptic</li>
    </ol>
