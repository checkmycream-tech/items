            <li>I have a fondness for this scent...had a kind of &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; side to it...</li>
            <li>They shipped the prduct very quickly (even removed a mistake I made using 1-click which would have sent a duplicate order to my own address!)  </li>
            <li>I wore this fragrance as a teenager many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it reminds me of my dear mother</li>

            <li>And he&#x27;s enjoying it.</li>
            <li>me feel exotic</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the oustanding service from the seller (very accessible and helpful.)</li>
            <li>I love it and am grateful to be able to find it so easily this time.</li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t like that it is made in China, and the cap doesn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too sweet, so the search continues.</li>
            <li>It is not the true &amp;#34;Tweed&amp;#34; fragrance I wore when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I snatched it quickly.</li>
            <li>You can tell it was not made by the original makers, but it was my mothers favorite and smelled very similar.</li>
            <li>so please be aware when you purchase.</li>
            <li>The perfume brings back memories of &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;....when I wear it, I get so many compliments....</li>
            <li>think that the things that smell good in childhood (when I remember this scent) don&#x27;t always smell the same now, and some things that smelled vile (like broccoli, say) are entirely bearable now.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to find it, but got worried because it took so long for the charge to hit my credit card and the order to be delivered.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, it&#x27;s become more and more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 67 years old and have worm this perfume off and on since I was 14.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t have quite the same scent, there is something off about it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance gives the appearance of being quite old.  </li>
            <li>This has been a favorite scent since I was in high school, but has become very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, I remember this as being a rather heavy scent--for winter, as one reviewer wrote--but sweet.</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume (excuse me) &amp;#34;parfum de Toillete&amp;#34; as a gift for a second time and was very upset to find out that the smell lasted 10 min.</li>
            <li>It exudes an untrue fragrance which is usually developed from a product that has been on the shelf for too long.  </li>

            <li> Spray is difficult and doesn&#x27;t alway work.</li>
            <li> wrong...</li>
            <li> color wrong, scent wrong.</li>
            <li> Bottle at Marshalll&#x27;s for a mere $4.99.</li>

            <li> I wore this fragrance as a teenager many years ago.  To me this is a fall fragrance - you wear it with sweaters and tweed.  Here it is June and I don&#x27;t know what made me think of it now because I usually only think of it in September!  I love it and am grateful to be able to find it so easily this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 67 years old and have worm this perfume off and on since I was 14.  Over the years, it&#x27;s become more and more difficult to find.  Thank you so much for carrying this wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it reminds me of my dear mother</li>
            <li> Smells like it should...</li>
            <li> This is an item I have used for decades, buying it from a source in England for years.  Much to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t have quite the same scent, there is something off about it. and then I read the label -- made in China!  And that is the problem!!</li>
            <li> It was perfect fragrance as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gift for a relative who had asked me to look for it in department stores. It was at least $10. less than other sellers.  They shipped the prduct very quickly (even removed a mistake I made using 1-click which would have sent a duplicate order to my own address!)  The recipient was delighted with the gift fragrance. (Apparently it is much harder to come by than I had thought.) I was pleased with the oustanding service from the seller (very accessible and helpful.) I plan to order gifts again from them.</li>
            <li> I started using tweed in 1960&#x27;s and still like the sent although I don&#x27;t like that it is made in China, and the cap doesn&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the scent I remember. It&#x27;s too sweet, so the search continues. Now I have to figure out how to return it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume (excuse me) &amp;#34;parfum de Toillete&amp;#34; as a gift for a second time and was very upset to find out that the smell lasted 10 min. It was rather upsetting because it is well past the return policy for me to even attempt to switch it/return it etc. I almost forgot to do a review until the person I purchased it for brought it up again. My guess is it&#x27;s a hit or miss with these. so please be aware when you purchase. Test it as soon as you get it.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite scent since I was in high school, but has become very hard to find.  I was quite pleased to find it, but got worried because it took so long for the charge to hit my credit card and the order to be delivered.  Thank goodness it did eventually arrive.</li>
            <li> I have a fondness for this scent...had a kind of &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; side to it...that charms the nose..at least mine&lt;br /&gt;A very good buy.</li>
            <li> Good Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it as a gift and she loves it.  We just love the Fragrance  of Tweed and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> The perfume brings back memories of &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;....when I wear it, I get so many compliments....it has become my signature perfume....</li>
            <li> This fragrance gives the appearance of being quite old.  It exudes an untrue fragrance which is usually developed from a product that has been on the shelf for too long.  It is not the true &amp;#34;Tweed&amp;#34; fragrance I wore when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Spray is difficult and doesn&#x27;t alway work.</li>
            <li> You can tell it was not made by the original makers, but it was my mothers favorite and smelled very similar.</li>
            <li> Stated fragrance was correct even if different color...wrong...color wrong, scent wrong.</li>
            <li> I spotted a 1.7 oz. Bottle at Marshalll&#x27;s for a mere $4.99. I snatched it quickly. I remembered it from the 80&#x27;s. A beautiful fragrance. Best for evenings and fall/winter.</li>
            <li> Well, it smells good. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t smell as I remembered. Perhaps this is due to my aging nose?  think that the things that smell good in childhood (when I remember this scent) don&#x27;t always smell the same now, and some things that smelled vile (like broccoli, say) are entirely bearable now. Or maybe the company that makes it now has changed the contents. At any rate, I remember this as being a rather heavy scent--for winter, as one reviewer wrote--but sweet. The sweetness isn&#x27;t there. I asked my husband if it smells like aftershave, and he says yes. And he&#x27;s enjoying it. But it really doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to, at least to me.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;cannot be called perfume in any &amp;#34;scent &amp;#34; of the word. It is awful, something worse than cheap bathroom spray,in fact I wouldn&#x27;t even use it for that......My mistake....Into the garbage it goes.</li>
            <li> loveit very much especially the scent.make me feel exotic</li>
