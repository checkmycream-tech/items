            <li>but the same great original product.</li>
            <li>This was originally a tip from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>it is not the original formula.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the perfect hair product to keep my curly/frizzy/dry hair looking good, and I have finally found it.  </li>
            <li>The best for delicate end problems.</li>

            <li>Always works, never fails.</li>
            <li>I have been putting a tiny bit on my ends at night before wrapping my hair, and I love the results in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to keep it at the long length I want because my ends are 5Xs stronger.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a smaller bottle (2.6oz) of this for my wife, who can easily get frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Favorite single hair care product.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my long hair supporting the ends and keeping them from breaking off so easily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It makes soo much easier to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>The difference between this product and the real thing is night and day.</li>
            <li>Absolutely can&#x27;t go without it now.</li>
            <li>I would suggest shopping around online when purchasing, I found it much cheaper</li>
            <li>Very Sold.</li>
            <li>The hair cream treatment really works.</li>
            <li>as described in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is one product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And, it arrived early!</li>
            <li>and this helps smooth it out without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It is a water based product which doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft or manageble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a serum which leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>i dont know im just trying it, so far i dont have any discomfort</li>
            <li>, my hair feels soft, i hope it will work and repair my hair...</li>
            <li>No heavy, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft and flowing.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to be sure to keep a few extra tubes on hand in case they stop making it!  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse hair and its silky soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Instant, natural looking shine.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy as many other products that I tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I put this in my hair it was much softer and not near as dry.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry hair, naturally and from highlights.</li>
            <li>and when I found that I could order this...get twice as much product for 1/2 (YUP half)</li>
            <li>First of all, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>The serum I bought from the other seller makes it possible for me to manage my new growth without causing breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The serum I bought from the other seller makes it possible for me to manage my new growth without causing breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer and flat iron on my hair daily.  </li>
            <li> l have relaxed hair and use this product everyday on my new growth.</li>
            <li> long hair can get caught and damaged....</li>
            <li> but it was coming international, so that is expected.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American female and I don&#x27;t wash everyday.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and the ends are split.  </li>
            <li> With this pregnancy, my hair is soooo dry and the ends are breaking.  </li>
            <li> My ends are no longer dry, brittle and frayed.</li>
            <li> It is a really bad product which have a very strong aroma which triggers my headaches.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t open it until I finished my other authentic bottle purchased from elsewhere b/c</li>
            <li> previous product I bought from a different seller.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the price, but you do only use a little each time so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered to my door before the expected time posted online.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The secret is not to use much.</li>
            <li> This is not the only negative about the product, it totally differs from my previous product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged and thin and this product makes my hair soft and helps to repair my broken ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried five other products and this has given me immediate results.  </li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way on my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> This product weight my hair down and makes my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that controls my coarse difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked at how much thicker my ends look (and I have long hair).</li>
            <li> When I comb my hair now the is little to no breakage.</li>
            <li> In less than a month you will decide never to be without it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I put it on damp hair before drying and then add a small amount to styled ends after curling.  </li>
            <li> I used the product after washing, along with my usual leave in conditioner and heat protectant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now too late to return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dishonest!</li>
            <li> Buy it from a salon, this is a fake product.  </li>
            <li> I hate being duped!</li>

            <li> The best product ever, it makes your hair feel healthy  and shinny even with my highlights </li>
            <li> great product. my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using it for over 5 years now.  A little product goes a long way on my long, thick hair.  I prefer this over any of the oils on the market.  Maybe because I like the smell.</li>
            <li> It such a great value for the price. I love this stuff for my dry hair. It works wonders.</li>
            <li> Favorite single hair care product.  I put it on damp hair before drying and then add a small amount to styled ends after curling.  Great for fly aways too. Mimics a Brazilian blow out for me.  Also opted for over night Saturday shipping and product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Amazing prouduct amazing price</li>
            <li> This hair care product is the best.  It makes soo much easier to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product from this seller. It is a really bad product which have a very strong aroma which triggers my headaches. This is not the only negative about the product, it totally differs from my previous product. This product weight my hair down and makes my hair sticky. It is a water based product which doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft or manageble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous product I bought from a different seller. It&#x27;s a serum which leaves my hair soft and silky. l have relaxed hair and use this product everyday on my new growth. The serum I bought from the other seller makes it possible for me to manage my new growth without causing breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the product from this seller people buy it from another vendor!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as described. Will order again as it makes a big difference how my hair looks and feels</li>
            <li> i dont know im just trying it, so far i dont have any discomfort , my hair feels soft, i hope it will work and repair my hair... i just start to put it on...</li>
            <li> Buy it from a salon, this is a fake product.  The difference between this product and the real thing is night and day.</li>
            <li> Love this product on my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product! Absolutely can&#x27;t go without it now. I would suggest shopping around online when purchasing, I found it much cheaper but the same great original product.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a smaller bottle (2.6oz) of this for my wife, who can easily get frizzies.  She decided it was fantastic for her hair and split ends and asked me to buy more. So I did,- four 5.1 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  A Better price on line.  It&#x27;s the best of both worlds.  WIll order it again.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the perfect hair product to keep my curly/frizzy/dry hair looking good, and I have finally found it.  Now I have to be sure to keep a few extra tubes on hand in case they stop making it!  I would just be so sad to not have it any more...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  This is the most awesome product I have ever used on my hair.  You can use it wet or dry.  Makes your hair silky soft and smells great. I have very coarse hair and its silky soft after using this product.  Very Sold.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered to my door before the expected time posted online.  I&#x27;ve been using the product since, and am very pleased with how it works.  My hair is dry and the ends are split.  I use a blow dryer and flat iron on my hair daily.  This product keeps the &amp;#34;weak spots&amp;#34; in my hair (specifically, my bangs) looking healthy.  I am very pleased with the product and will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> The best things since before sliced bread. I have extremely dry hair, naturally and from highlights. My stylist suggested this product and it literally has saved my hair. I&#x27;m able to keep it at the long length I want because my ends are 5Xs stronger. I still get some breakage but that&#x27;s to be expected. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this product... makes ends smoother and in the winter with sweaters and fleece .... long hair can get caught and damaged....so I love this... my daughter loves this....my granddaughter loves this.... my great granddaughter loves this... we have been using this product for probably six years and when I found that I could order this...get twice as much product for 1/2 (YUP half) the money.... I am pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love how it makes my dry ends feel smooth</li>
            <li> The best for delicate end problems.</li>
            <li> It works! Has brought my ends back to life. Got it in the mail pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Sealed Ends is the best.  My hair is very damaged and thin and this product makes my hair soft and helps to repair my broken ends.  I received it in about 8 days and went back to buy more.  This is also a bigger size than I can get at my salon.  I will be a return customer for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works awesome-price is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works beautifully with bamboo thermal.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it every day. Repaired my fried hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. THE PRICE IS EXCELLANT AND THE SIZE IS GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years.  I have coarse, thick, curly hair and this helps smooth it out without weighing it down.  It&#x27;s light, adds shine and keeps curls under control.  I have tried everything from John Frieda, to Frederik Fekkai....from inexpensive to most expensive and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> No heavy, not greasy. Will add a bit of shine to your hair while decreasing frizziness and fly-aways. And that is all the BONUS...imagine that it also does what it is supposed to: correct and repair damaged ends (great for stubborn bangs too!). This was originally a tip from my hairdresser. So glad she told me about it.&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked at how much thicker my ends look (and I have long hair). Give this a try! In less than a month you will decide never to be without it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Amazing for my hair !!!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that controls my coarse difficult hair.  It makes it soft and flowing.  The product arrived on time and I am totally satisfied with product, shipment and cost.</li>
            <li> Always works, never fails. Reliable product. Silky hair is promised when using this.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got fine wavy hair  does an awesome job keeping it for matting and braking off</li>
            <li> Love your products I always look make sure I order from you</li>
            <li> Great product! It nourishes my hair after every wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Prevents end splitting while making your hair smell good with a silky finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the product that I needed. My hair looks beautiful when I use that product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it protects your ends like no other product.  Don&#x27;t look anywhere else this type of product!</li>
            <li> Order arrived ahead of schedule and all was well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.  The secret is not to use much.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This was the best price on this awesome product... And, it arrived early!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It took several days to ship but it was coming international, so that is expected.  As soon as I put this in my hair it was much softer and not near as dry.  With this pregnancy, my hair is soooo dry and the ends are breaking.  I have no doubt this product is going to make a huge difference in my hair! I&#x27;ve tried five other products and this has given me immediate results.  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> Schwarzkopf Bonacure Repair Rescue Sealed Ends is a phenomenal product. I greatly prefer this mega size (5.1 oz) over the smaller unit offered. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It really helps my long hair supporting the ends and keeping them from breaking off so easily.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this brand. The hair cream treatment really works.</li>
            <li> Thank you….received as described in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.......LOVE IT.!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in solution. My hair feels silky and smooth and easily controlled.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair ends products I&#x27;ve tried,  that&#x27;s why I ordered two at once.</li>
            <li> I already knew about it cause as a hairdresser I havs been using it for a long time and me and my clients are in love with this magic potion! :)</li>
            <li> I have used repair rescue sealed ends for over 5 years and it is the absolute most amazing product on earth. I ordered the bonus size from this seller and I know for sure it is not the original formula. As soon as I opened it I noticed it not only doesn&#x27;t  smell the same but when I used it it turned to the consistency of glue and made my hair so sticky it was actually unbrushable! Too bad I didn&#x27;t open it until I finished my other authentic bottle purchased from elsewhere b/c it&#x27;s now too late to return. I hate being duped! It&#x27;s so dishonest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Put a pea size amount in the palm of your hand, rub together and run your hands through your hair.  Instant, natural looking shine.  Not greasy as many other products that I tried in the past.  This is one product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great! And it came earlier than I thought!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair so soft and silky</li>
            <li> I shop a lot on Amazon and don&#x27;t always have time to write reviews but this product worked so well, that I had to make the effort. First of all, a little goes a long way and I&#x27;m glad I got the Mega size because I never want to run out. I used the product after washing, along with my usual leave in conditioner and heat protectant. I saw a difference immediately. I am an African American female and I don&#x27;t wash everyday. I have been putting a tiny bit on my ends at night before wrapping my hair, and I love the results in the morning. When I comb my hair now the is little to no breakage. The smell is wonderful as well as the light weight of the cream. My ends are no longer dry, brittle and frayed. This was the final product I needed in my arsenal on my hair care journey.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> Love it and is working. Only complaint is the price, but you do only use a little each time so it should last a while.</li>
