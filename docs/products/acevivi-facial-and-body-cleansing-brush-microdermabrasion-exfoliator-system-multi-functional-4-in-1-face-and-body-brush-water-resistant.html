            <li> I bought the ACEVIVI Portable Multi-functional Facial Pore Cleaner 4-in-1 for my wife because she mentioned that she wanted one when she saw a similar product advertised on TV.  This was considerably cheaper than the one at the store.  My wife is completely happy with it. She uses it daily and can&#x27;t believe how well it helps her skin. But it isn&#x27;t just for use on your face you can also use it to remove calluses on your feet and hands.  My wife couldn&#x27;t be happy with her results her skin looks better and youthful. My wife loves it so much she had to buy one for her sister and her mother. This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Loved this , it made my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> It works great!!! My skin is soft and clean feeling! I use it daily and everyone has notice my radiant skin. I recommend this product to any one who wants a spa feeling in your own home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE NEEDED THIS FOR SO LONG! I tried to get my husband to use this, he won&#x27;t, but this is great before I put on my mask. And it keeps my skin smooth. I buy a lot of ACEVIVI stuff and I tried their mask with this. No complaints here. Easy to clean and not too hard on my skin. If you need a pore cleanser get this one because I looked and this is the cheapest price for your money&#x27;s worth :)</li>

            <li> Both my wife and teenage daughter use this. My daughter has acne and this helped her along with another exfoliating product. My wife uses this before putting on her mask. Its also travel friendly.</li>
            <li> This thing works like a charm. Its done wonders for my skin. I have been fighting adult acne the past 6 months and everyone was telling me to get one of these but I neber could bring myself to drop the nearly 200 bucks I&#x27;d need to spend on a name brand at my local Ulta or whatever so when I saw this one at this price I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and im so glad I did. I use it every night after I take off my makeup and I love it</li>
