            <li>so I was very happy to find it.</li>

            <li>Have been wearing this mascara for over 20 years as it is the perfect one for those of us with contacts.</li>

            <li>So glad to find again, best brush ever and great waterproof formula soft lashes.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The applicator brush is perfect to get every lash; the consistency of the mascara is never thin, but smoothly substantial.</li>
            <li>Mascara is an essential part of my makeup routine, and after many years of searching for the best one, this is it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara and the places I used to get it no longer sell it.</li>
            <li>What I like the most is the brush.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this on your site as I have looked all over for this product.</li>
            <li>This mascara has been outstanding over the years.</li>
            <li>glad to get some again</li>
            <li>It was much better, made my lashes longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I had better ones, so would not buy it again, just tried once.</li>
            <li>However you can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to locate this discontinued mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love it because I wear contacts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find another favorite.</li>
            <li>love this product, thats why I order it on line..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found some that I bought all they had.</li>
            <li>glad I can get thru amazon.</li>
            <li>any more so I have to order online.</li>
            <li>Really really waterproof!!!!</li>
            <li>It maximizes my lashes with beautiful, natural results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see that Amazon carries this product because none of the stores seem to carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>I like this mascara because it does not smudge easily (even though I tend to rub my eyes a bit throughout the day).</li>
            <li>and I could clean it more easily with Neutrogena waterproof make up remover.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a bit banged up but product is fine.</li>
            <li>I figured since I am their most loyal customer they&#x27;d warn me</li>
            <li>The teddy bear brush helps it go on smoothly and lengthen my lashes plus the product does not get goopy or flake off.  </li>
            <li>the printing on the cardboard looked really cheap, and the brush, and tube did not seem up to standards.</li>
            <li>I wish this was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and unfortunately it is no longer sold in stores</li>
            <li>It was my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>As a professional make-up artist, I liked the consistency and the hold it gave my clients as well as myself</li>
            <li>I found this and have been a true follower ever since.</li>
            <li>It seems when a good product comes along and then mysteriously disappears from store shelves that the company that manufactures the stuff isn&#x27;t in tune with the customer.  </li>
            <li>This one is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>… i find it&#x27;s the only kind of mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for many years, occasionally trying others</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my lashes down… every other kind i&#x27;ve tried i don&#x27;t like… wish they would start making it again…</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the bait and switch technique.</li>
            <li>Ordering online was simple, quick, and cheaper than running around looking for a product that is no longer on the shelves.  </li>
            <li>After trying many different brands over the years, this is the only mascara that I like.</li>
            <li>I love this product - hard to find in stores these day, thanks!</li>
            <li>It is the only mascara I have used that keeps my lashes curled and looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>The price was a little higher than I normally pay, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because I wanted to try something new and because of good reviews I read on Amazon, but after I tried it, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other mascaras I used, so I am definitely going back to the previous mascara I used Almay Waterproof.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product has been discontinued</li>
            <li>I think they stopped selling this product in stores near me, so since I had used it regularly before I went to buy it online.  </li>
            <li>Apparently Loreal is not making this anymore.</li>
            <li>Product was better than previous purchase, not as dried out</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Product was better than previous purchase, not as dried out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of different types of mascaras whether it be cheap or expensive</li>
            <li> I have since tried several other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and they are not the same.  </li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes</li>
            <li> This tube was not as dry as the one I purchased on Amazon a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> I have spent a TON of money on other mascaras only to throw them away.  </li>
            <li> It keeps eyelashes up, even for the straightest eyelashes that are short and go / grow down.</li>
            <li> so I used / tried other mascaras for a long time until I realized</li>
            <li> The packaging was old and outdated and I am actually hesitant about using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and am disappointed that L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> and when I used other brands and those weren&#x27;t waterproof I would look like someone had used windshield wipers around my eyes from the smudging just from blinking.</li>
            <li> From reading other buyers ratings it appears they made a mistake by pulling it from stores.  </li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years, its the best!&lt;br /&gt;Never clumps and extends my lashes longer than any other mascara i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The waterproof black does not cause my curled lashes to droop and uncurl.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is just not special at all to me.</li>
            <li> I really hate that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this mascara… i order it from here every time but not sure how long i can get it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears that L&#x27;Oreal is discontinuing it because I cannot find it at the stores where I usually purchase the mascara.</li>
            <li> I hate that it was discontinued and now this is the only way I can buy it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed this time round when ordering it.</li>
            <li> It stays on yet is not that difficult to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> do they even make fake loreal mascara?  </li>
            <li> Frustrated that Loreal quit making this wondeful product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still unhappy they discontinued it!</li>
            <li> and I have used it for years and years and now it is discontinued :-(</li>

            <li> Wish they still made this. It was my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Mascara is an essential part of my makeup routine, and after many years of searching for the best one, this is it. It maximizes my lashes with beautiful, natural results.  The applicator brush is perfect to get every lash; the consistency of the mascara is never thin, but smoothly substantial. I&#x27;ve used this mascara for many years, occasionally trying others but I&#x27;ve always returned to this specific one. I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and am disappointed that L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it.  It is by far the best mascara I have ever used.  I have spent a TON of money on other mascaras only to throw them away.  This one is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor who shipped it to me was great, as well.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find this product everywhere. This is my favorite mascara and the places I used to get it no longer sell it. It is the only mascara I have used that keeps my lashes curled and looking fresh all day.  THANK YOU!  Mari</li>
            <li> I have been using the same mascara for YEARS, and without warning...I could no longer find it in ANY store.  I looked everywhere.  Ordering online was simple, quick, and cheaper than running around looking for a product that is no longer on the shelves.  I WILL order again!</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years.  The waterproof black does not cause my curled lashes to droop and uncurl.  It stays on yet is not that difficult to remove at the end of the day.  I have since tried several other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and they are not the same.  WHY WHY WHY did they discontinue this product??!!!  It was GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever and can&#x27;t find ANYTHING I like that comes close to it, has to be waterproof!</li>
            <li> Will only use this mascara.  Only one that will keep my eyelashes curled.  Thank you for having it in stock.  Cannot seem to find anywhere in stores.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it does not smudge easily (even though I tend to rub my eyes a bit throughout the day). However, WAY too much mascara gets trapped on the brush and I have to wipe it off 3 or 4 times before using it. Otherwise it just globs on and clumps your lashes.</li>
            <li> Apparently this product has been discontinued so I bought 5 of these. I can not find a replacement that I like as well as this. What I like the most is the brush. I was glad to find this on your site as I have looked all over for this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product anymore and have used it for years.  I looked on the L&#x27;Oreal website site and found I could buy it on Amazon.  The price on their website was 6.99.  However, when I went to Amazon, it was over 11.00.  What&#x27;s with that?  I ordered it because I can&#x27;t get it anywhere else but I really don&#x27;t like the bait and switch technique.</li>
            <li> After trying many different brands over the years, this is the only mascara that I like. Unfortunately, it appears that L&#x27;Oreal is discontinuing it because I cannot find it at the stores where I usually purchase the mascara. I&#x27;ll keep ordering it from Amazon until the supply is depleted, then I&#x27;ll be in a fix. This mascara has been outstanding over the years. It is indeed waterproof and doesn&#x27;t flake all over my face even when working outside in 100 degree plus weather. The price was a little higher than I normally pay, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is truly great.  The teddy bear brush helps it go on smoothly and lengthen my lashes plus the product does not get goopy or flake off.  I always use waterproof mascara because otherwise I get \\&quot;shadows\\&quot; under my eyes at the end of the day.  I&#x27;m so excited to see that Amazon carries this product because none of the stores seem to carry it any more.  Time to stock up!</li>
            <li> Product was better than previous purchase, not as dried out</li>
            <li> Best waterproof and long-wearing mascara i&#x27;ve ever used. i have been unable to get this locally after using it for many years and suspect it may be discontinued. glad to get some again</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because I wanted to try something new and because of good reviews I read on Amazon, but after I tried it, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other mascaras I used, so I am definitely going back to the previous mascara I used Almay Waterproof. It was much better, made my lashes longer and thicker and I could clean it more easily with Neutrogena waterproof make up remover. This mascara is just not special at all to me. I had better ones, so would not buy it again, just tried once.</li>
            <li> I wish they never discontinued this product. It has been my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara fro 10+ years</li>
            <li> Really really waterproof!!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara has always been the best and I&#x27;m still unhappy they discontinued it!</li>
            <li> The best in the world!!! I used this for years but then it discontinued so I used / tried other mascaras for a long time until I realized this was on Amazon so I am here to say you need to buy.. It keeps eyelashes up, even for the straightest eyelashes that are short and go / grow down. This tube was not as dry as the one I purchased on Amazon a couple months ago. Loreal lash out the best! Never stop selling this please!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years. You can&#x27;t cry it off and it never runs or smears. Every time someone borrows my mascara then they start using it too. However you can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!! Frustrated that Loreal quit making this wondeful product. Cannot find anything else that compares to this product</li>
            <li> I really hate that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this mascara… i order it from here every time but not sure how long i can get it… i find it&#x27;s the only kind of mascara (and i&#x27;ve tried a LOT) that i can curl my eyelashes and put the mascara on and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my lashes down… every other kind i&#x27;ve tried i don&#x27;t like… wish they would start making it again… i like the waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t run…</li>
            <li> The absolute best mascara.  I wish it was not discontinued!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere. Has anyone contacted Loreal about this? I will order it through Amazon, if that&#x27;s the case.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to locate this discontinued mascara.  Love it because I wear contacts.  Doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge.  I wish it was being made again.</li>
            <li> BEST lash lengthening mascara...I wish it would come back into the stores!</li>
            <li> So glad to find again, best brush ever and great waterproof formula soft lashes.</li>
            <li> I think they stopped selling this product in stores near me, so since I had used it regularly before I went to buy it online.  The product was drier than it should have been, so it flaked off and irritated my eyes.  Defintely not the product it used to be, so I&#x27;ll have to find another favorite.</li>
            <li> do they even make fake loreal mascara?  the printing on the cardboard looked really cheap, and the brush, and tube did not seem up to standards.</li>
            <li> love this product, thats why I order it on line.. stores discontinued it.. great mascera. a must buy and priced gread</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years and when Loreal decided to stop production I started going to Amazon to buy it. As a professional make-up artist, I liked the consistency and the hold it gave my clients as well as myself and I could promote it from personal experience. I was disappointed this time round when ordering it. The packaging was old and outdated and I am actually hesitant about using it. I think it may be time to move on to another brand finally.</li>
            <li> Apparently Loreal is not making this anymore. I figured since I am their most loyal customer they&#x27;d warn me but they didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m so glad I found some that I bought all they had. I have very long eyelashes and when I used other brands and those weren&#x27;t waterproof I would look like someone had used windshield wipers around my eyes from the smudging just from blinking. I found this and have been a true follower ever since.</li>
            <li> The best mascara EVER!! Shame on Loreal, for discontinuing it!!</li>
            <li> It seems when a good product comes along and then mysteriously disappears from store shelves that the company that manufactures the stuff isn&#x27;t in tune with the customer.  From reading other buyers ratings it appears they made a mistake by pulling it from stores.  But Amazon to the rescue.  Thank you for providing me with a source once again.</li>
            <li> I wish this was still available in stores. glad I can get thru amazon. was amazed when I found it</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I hate that it was discontinued and now this is the only way I can buy it. The wand gives great length and fullness. And it&#x27;s great for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and unfortunately it is no longer sold in stores so I was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of different types of mascaras whether it be cheap or expensive and I keep coming back to this! Not sold in stores any more so I have to order online.</li>
            <li> It is the best Mascara ever and I have used it for years and years and now it is discontinued :-(</li>
            <li> I hope L&#x27;Oreal will re-consider their decision to discontinue&lt;br /&gt;this product.  I have used this product for years.  No other&lt;br /&gt;product compares.  sbernard</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years, its the best!&lt;br /&gt;Never clumps and extends my lashes longer than any other mascara i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this mascara for over 20 years as it is the perfect one for those of us with contacts.</li>
            <li> I love this product - hard to find in stores these day, thanks! The packaging was a bit banged up but product is fine.</li>
