            <li>and they both work great.</li>
            <li>shampoo cleans well, doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the bottle says, but in combination with the conditioner, it works great on my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TREsemme Does make for the price great shampoo and conditioners so if your counting coins this is the way to save some.&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>

            <li>Works great, has a good smells but not a fake/overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>recommendation for a good shampoo for curly, frizzy hair is : http://www.amazon.com/John-Frieda-Smooth-Shampoo-Repairing/dp/B0038NNENQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title</li>
            <li>good deal</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>For one, I love avocado and it nourishes hair great.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera was also a nice plus.</li>
            <li>I liked the price</li>
            <li>Nice to see a mainstream known brand name product paying attention to consumers</li>
            <li>it gets his hair clean and smells great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, but there is a TON of it on my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love what Tresemme Naturals (the shampoo+conditioner) does to my hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT,</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>It is the best value shampoo out there which takes into account those of us who want to limit sulfate use (or reduce it) but don&#x27;t want to pay the big bucks to do so.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and it cleans my hair without drying it.  </li>
            <li>While my hair wasn&#x27;t getting drier, it wasn&#x27;t getting better either.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>demands for healthy products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good paired with leave-in conditioners and oils.  </li>
            <li>the smell seems a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but after awhile it kind of left me wondering what else is out there.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>haha, so trust me when i say i found an amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Despite the lack of conditioner, my hair still looked shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used because I usually just buy dollar store shampoo.</li>
            <li>This gets my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell so much</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to be the perfect balance of moisturizing and cleaning, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>--it has a mild scent, not too strong, and the shampoo really made my hair feel</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spent tons of money searching for moisturizing shampoos for my hair, so it was a pleasant surprise to learn about this one.</li>
            <li>I tried a bottle of this, it lasted forever and was really gentle on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo as an inexpensive alternative to the sulfate free shampoos, for my large family.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel clean and smell great, but it also dried it out quite a bit!</li>
            <li>I am almost 2 years natural, and I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I found I didn&#x27;t have to use a conditioner right after.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because Tresemme usually makes some great products, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for me!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price over a bargain shampoo for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable, the bottle takes me awhile to finish since it is very large.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner, it made my hair soft and healthy for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I used BioSilk before and loved it, but was trying to save a little money and went for this product.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the name may be a hype, but the price was right, my hair is clean, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have used this exact shampoo for years, and I ordered it off Amazon for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer with it the first time I used it, and my hair was very ELECTRIFIED!  </li>
            <li>Enough static electricity to power the space shuttle.  </li>
            <li>if my hair needs a more thorough cleaning (only about once a month or so).</li>
            <li>Much better than the regular tresemme.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it is appropriate for the entire family to use.</li>
            <li>It was pretty moisturizing</li>
            <li>The container was open and most of the product spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo and conditioner on my two young daughters, their long fine hair looks amazingly better than it did with Herbal Essences or Suave.</li>
            <li>my psoriasis are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the first week or so of use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand because it&#x27;s definitely way better for your hair than dollar store brands, yet it&#x27;s still affordable.</li>
            <li>I wanted something the whole family could use, so it needed to be a decent sized bottle so it would last more than a week.</li>
            <li>With shampoos offering more moisture, my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean enough, even the same brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, my hair tends to get dry and tangled with certain shampoos but this one gives the right amount of moisture and does not weigh my hair down, it also does not leave my hair overly tangled.</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty decent shampoo, this review is for my friend Rae.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize your hair and makes it feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>cost of this shampoo means I don&#x27;t have to be concerned with how much she uses.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my scalp and the natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have either left my scalp drier or my hair more brittle.</li>
            <li>This is a clear shampoo not a creamy white one like most moisture shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely budget friendly and does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I typically use sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair not only soft and moisturized, it nourished and moisturized my scalp as well reducing my psoriasis and flakiness by 60% with just the first wash.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing and goes well with other brands of conditioner</li>
            <li>but I have tried every natural shampoo brand on the market for my hair and nothing has helped.</li>
            <li>What an affordable alternative for natural hair (hair without chemical straightening or curling)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo believing it was natural.</li>
            <li>(although I do use it frequently with the Touchable Softness Conditioner).</li>
            <li>i have thick middle eastern hair, yes super curly and yes super frizzy.</li>
            <li>I normally use high end hair products, but recently we have decided to cut costs in our budget and only buy products that we have a coupon for.</li>
            <li>Paraben free products are hard to find.</li>
            <li>because the Tresemme conditioner that goes with this just was not heavy duty enough for her thirsty locks.</li>
            <li>When I go to squeeze out the extra water after a shower my hair usually feels really soft and smooth, but after using this it just felt dry and brittle and was striping my hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li>She also has very thich hair that is tough to shampoo -- you have to use a lot of product to get to the roots of her hair (waist length curly hair that is super thick and mixed fine and coarser</li>
            <li>One has unbelievably straight hair, the other wavy.</li>
            <li>In fact my daughter likes it so much that she would chose this over some of the other pricier brands!</li>
            <li>Naturally curly hair tends towards dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>and I DEFINITELY appreciated the lower sulfates and less damaging effects...</li>
            <li>The large size makes it convenient since you do not need a ne bottle ever few weeks.</li>

            <li> Naturally curly hair tends towards dry and frizzy.  </li>

            <li> The large size makes it convenient since you do not need a ne bottle ever few weeks.</li>
            <li> , for any woman who is extremely price conscious for that matter.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be so dry and frizzy, now is soft and shiny and I don&#x27;t need to use any other extra product.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I do some research and find that it has:</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very fine (weird, I know!</li>
            <li> : I have long, thick curly/frizzy (large looser curls) hair</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that have sulfates in them, this one does not dry my hair out</li>
            <li> Also not natural at all.</li>
            <li> It does not strip her hair (leaving it with no natural oil), cause it to feel like straw, and it doesn&#x27;t contribute to her tangles.</li>
            <li> Normally, the Sunday paper usually has coupons for Tresemme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, switching from something that was actually natural, and now have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have medium to slightly dry hair then give the condish a try -- but for truly dry hair take a pass in our opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry hair, so I asked my \\&quot;hair expert\\&quot; friend for a recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and the conditioner a few months back at a local store.</li>
            <li> However we were running into a problem because my daughter&#x27;s hair is so dry (like the Sahara!)</li>
            <li> i have chemically straightened my hair twice, flat iron it everyday, before the flat iron i used to do it with an iron and iron board</li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this because Tresemme usually makes some great products, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for me! The price/value is great and the shampoo smells great. It made my hair feel clean and smell great, but it also dried it out quite a bit! When I go to squeeze out the extra water after a shower my hair usually feels really soft and smooth, but after using this it just felt dry and brittle and was striping my hair of natural oils. Might work for some, but didn&#x27;t for me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have long, thick curly/frizzy (large looser curls) hair that&#x27;s very fine (weird, I know! My hair is very fine, but there is a TON of it on my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for a good shampoo for curly, frizzy hair is : http://www.amazon.com/John-Frieda-Smooth-Shampoo-Repairing/dp/B0038NNENQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title</li>
            <li> I love what Tresemme Naturals (the shampoo+conditioner) does to my hair. My hair used to be so dry and frizzy, now is soft and shiny and I don&#x27;t need to use any other extra product. Incredibly my husband realized the difference and ask me what I did to my hair. Also I washed my kid&#x27;s hair with it and his grandma ask me if I took him to the beauty salon lol&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will use it forever!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have used in years!  My hair is silky, smooth and shiny.  And the price isnot bad.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used because I usually just buy dollar store shampoo. This stuff is only $4 at Safeway and it&#x27;s amazing. It really does moisturize your hair and makes it feel much healthier. I use this with the non-matching TRESemme conditioner for dry/damaged hair and the two of them together work wonders. I highly recommend this brand because it&#x27;s definitely way better for your hair than dollar store brands, yet it&#x27;s still affordable.</li>
            <li> I for one am not a lover of chemicals or shampoos with sulfates (even though there are indeed sulfates in this shampoo despite what the bottle says) but I have tried every natural shampoo brand on the market for my hair and nothing has helped. I have psoriasis on my scalp and the natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have either left my scalp drier or my hair more brittle. There was never a good balance of moisture for me. SO I saw this tresemme naturals shampoo and decided to try it out. For one, I love avocado and it nourishes hair great. The aloe vera was also a nice plus. This shampoo made my hair not only soft and moisturized, it nourished and moisturized my scalp as well reducing my psoriasis and flakiness by 60% with just the first wash. I was shocked and amazed and decided this would be my new go to shampoo. The conditioner is just as great. Also for those who have hard water using distilled water as a final rinse will boost the effects of the shampoo and since i started using distilled water my psoriasis are pretty much gone. This product is fantastic. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> i have thick middle eastern hair, yes super curly and yes super frizzy. i highly recommend tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner, it made my hair soft and healthy for the first time in years! i have chemically straightened my hair twice, flat iron it everyday, before the flat iron i used to do it with an iron and iron board haha, so trust me when i say i found an amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am almost 2 years natural, and I absolutely love this stuff.  It is definitely budget friendly and does what I need it to do. I use it along with the conditioner, and it does wonders for my hair.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a clear shampoo not a creamy white one like most moisture shampoos.  I noticed it&#x27;s not very moisturizing and the smell seems a bit strong for me. Also not natural at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this exact shampoo for years, and I ordered it off Amazon for the first time.  It looks and smells like hand soap! I&#x27;m not sure if TRESemme has changed their product, but I am not convinced that I was sent shampoo by Amazon.  Very unhappy and feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li> When rinsing this shampoo out, my hair felt like plastic strings - after drying and styling, like a dried out mess. I used BioSilk before and loved it, but was trying to save a little money and went for this product. I won&#x27;t buy again. The shampoo felt like it had wax in it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and Conditioner smells absolutely GREAT! I love the smell so much BUT this is NOT good for your hair!!! I actually purchased because of a youtuber but When I started using salon products, I had ran out and then opted for store bought and you can tell the difference in your hair. The way it styles and the way it feels and looks even. still haven&#x27;t found that store bought that makes me turn from the salon.....tired of salon prices but I ALWAYS go when there is a sale and just stock up lol</li>
            <li> OK.  This gets my hair squeaky clean.  I am not sure if it MOISTURIZES it as well.  I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer with it the first time I used it, and my hair was very ELECTRIFIED!  Yikes.  Enough static electricity to power the space shuttle.  I suspect that the name may be a hype, but the price was right, my hair is clean, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> great shampoo.. great price.  good deal</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, my hair tends to get dry and tangled with certain shampoos but this one gives the right amount of moisture and does not weigh my hair down, it also does not leave my hair overly tangled. I use along with [[ASIN:B003RSY1NE Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner - 25 oz]] and they both work great. I also use [[ASIN:B003N787AW Deep Cleansing Shampoo by Tresemme for Unisex - 32 oz Shampoo]] if my hair needs a more thorough cleaning (only about once a month or so).</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo as an inexpensive alternative to the sulfate free shampoos, for my large family. I wanted something the whole family could use, so it needed to be a decent sized bottle so it would last more than a week. Since using this shampoo and conditioner on my two young daughters, their long fine hair looks amazingly better than it did with Herbal Essences or Suave. One has unbelievably straight hair, the other wavy. Miss wavy hair tends to get frizzy and dried out looking, even though we don&#x27;t shampoo her hair every day. With this product, it is nothing but shiny and we don&#x27;t have a problem with tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleans well, doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the bottle says, but in combination with the conditioner, it works great on my girls&#x27; hair. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from the guys either. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it for my hair. I have a lot of blonde highlights so I have to watch what I use or it tangles really bad. This shampoo wasn&#x27;t terrible on my hair, but I prefer the sulfate free L&#x27;Oreal Ever pure line for color treated hair. So, out of the 7 people in my household using this product, I am the only one who wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Pretty good!</li>
            <li> Love this! What an affordable alternative for natural hair (hair without chemical straightening or curling)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent tons of money searching for moisturizing shampoos for my hair, so it was a pleasant surprise to learn about this one. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I think this is pretty decent shampoo, this review is for my friend Rae.&lt;br /&gt;Well, for any woman who is extremely price conscious for that matter. This moisturizes well, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It has LOWER SULFATES so that&#x27;s a good thing, smell : average, not worth writing home about.&lt;br /&gt;TREsemme Does make for the price great shampoo and conditioners so if your counting coins this is the way to save some.&lt;br /&gt;IF, my review has been helpful, click yes,. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I typically use sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s. We also do the Curly Girl co-wash with conditioner. However we were running into a problem because my daughter&#x27;s hair is so dry (like the Sahara!) but her scalp is not! Some of those shampoo&#x27;s worked wonders on her hair but not the scalp and vice versa. She also has very thich hair that is tough to shampoo -- you have to use a lot of product to get to the roots of her hair (waist length curly hair that is super thick and mixed fine and coarser strands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo turns out to be a great compromise for her. It does not strip her hair (leaving it with no natural oil), cause it to feel like straw, and it doesn&#x27;t contribute to her tangles. It&#x27;s slightly thick which is easier for her to deal with than runny. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it has a decent enough lather for what she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this without a conditioner for her -- and we use [[ASIN:B004ZWH39A Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner, 13 Fluid Ounce]] because the Tresemme conditioner that goes with this just was not heavy duty enough for her thirsty locks. If you have medium to slightly dry hair then give the condish a try -- but for truly dry hair take a pass in our opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this shampoo means I don&#x27;t have to be concerned with how much she uses. It is the best value shampoo out there which takes into account those of us who want to limit sulfate use (or reduce it) but don&#x27;t want to pay the big bucks to do so. In fact my daughter likes it so much that she would chose this over some of the other pricier brands!</li>
            <li> Naturally curly hair tends towards dry and frizzy.  This shampoo seems to be the perfect balance of moisturizing and cleaning, at least for me.  With shampoos offering more moisture, my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean enough, even the same brand.  So I&#x27;ve stuck with this one for quite some time, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo believing it was natural. (I&#x27;m a bad consumer and was in a hurry, I grabbed it without reading the label, my fault.) I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, switching from something that was actually natural, and now have dry scalp. Long story short, I do some research and find that it has: \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; also known as \\&quot;phthalates\\&quot; (i.e. plasticizers), and DMDM Hydantoin, an organic compound that slowly releases FORMALDEHYDE (i.e. the stuff we use to preserve dead bodies, it&#x27;s toxic to animals!) as a form of preservative. And those are just a few of the 20+ ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was buying a quality product, not embalming fluid. Guess I was wrong. If the EPA believes formaldehyde is unsafe to be used in the workplace then why is it allowed to be in shampoo I can buy in virtually any grocery store? I will not be purchasing Tresemmé products in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great, has a good smells but not a fake/overpowering fragrance. Will buy exclusively from now on instead of my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and the conditioner a few months back at a local store. I ended up returning them both. I don&#x27;t have damaged or chemically treated hair but this made my hair feel like straw and no other product has ever made my hair feel so terrible. Happy to hear it works great for some people but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I like the fact that the Tresemme Naturals line are lower in sulfates.  I love the way it smells and it cleans my hair without drying it.  I also like that the shampoos are well priced for the amount you get.  Definitely worth the price over a bargain shampoo for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry hair, so I asked my \\&quot;hair expert\\&quot; friend for a recommendation.  She told me to start co-washing and switch to Tresemme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first week or so of use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  While my hair wasn&#x27;t getting drier, it wasn&#x27;t getting better either.  No complaints about the scent or feel either--it has a mild scent, not too strong, and the shampoo really made my hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month into using this is when I noticed some changes.  My hair started to look shinier and smoother...no more nest head for me...and started to get greasier, usually within a day of shampooing.  Because of that, I cut out co-washing and decided to use this exclusively.  Despite the lack of conditioner, my hair still looked shiny and smooth.  I now wash my hair every other day and it&#x27;s never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of expensive for me, but if I can have shiny hair, I&#x27;ll take it :)</li>
            <li> he like this shampoo it gets his hair clean and smells great. The large size makes it convenient since you do not need a ne bottle ever few weeks. It will last several months.</li>
            <li> Much better than the regular tresemme. Price was very reasonable, the bottle takes me awhile to finish since it is very large. Smell is great. It cleans my hair very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird greasy film or anything.</li>
            <li> I normally use high end hair products, but recently we have decided to cut costs in our budget and only buy products that we have a coupon for. Normally, the Sunday paper usually has coupons for Tresemme. I love this shampoo. It is super moisturizing and goes well with other brands of conditioner (although I do use it frequently with the Touchable Softness Conditioner). Unlike other products that have sulfates in them, this one does not dry my hair out and I feel that it is appropriate for the entire family to use.</li>
            <li> I tried a bottle of this, it lasted forever and was really gentle on my fine hair.  It was pretty moisturizing and I DEFINITELY appreciated the lower sulfates and less damaging effects... I found I didn&#x27;t have to use a conditioner right after.  It&#x27;s pretty good paired with leave-in conditioners and oils.  I liked the price and I&#x27;ll probably come back to it.  I was just a little bored with the scent.  It smells good, but after awhile it kind of left me wondering what else is out there.</li>
            <li> The container was open and most of the product spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li> Paraben free products are hard to find. Nice to see a mainstream known brand name product paying attention to consumers demands for healthy products. Very nice product. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
