            <li>This cologne smells good.</li>
            <li>However, if someone does get close up you&#x27;ll smell good.</li>
            <li>I originally had 1.7ozs of this and bought this 4.2oz for (what I thought was) a great price!  </li>

            <li>Very nice smell and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>scent smells great and light; a nice sexiness to it without the dirt-man feel.</li>
            <li>but it is in fact simply a good sophisticated cologne.</li>
            <li>Each person interprets smell in their own way.</li>
            <li>Good Price, better than in store.</li>
            <li>I have done my fair share of cologne shopping and Armani Code is by far and away the best scent I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own yet...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m told I spell nice...</li>
            <li>that you know will provide you with the kind of quality you&#x27;d expect from a name brand cologne like Armani.</li>
            <li>this was a gift for my husbands birthday, I had smelled a magazine sample and liked the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li>this is a great fragrance that is not overpowering and very complimentary.</li>
            <li>I paid $70 for this bottle and I feel great about it compared to the $90 i paid for the original bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells great, worth the price!</li>
            <li>This is a very good cologne, not too strong, not too light, and it stays on for HOURS.</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance that is not overbearing and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong but it lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I like how I think the scent is liked by many because I don&#x27;t like overbearing/offensive scents.</li>

            <li>A great cologne for men, it has a sweet clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have never recieved more compliments in my life until I started wearing the cologne.  </li>
            <li>Service and delivery prompt and safe.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing hint to it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I get more complements when wearing this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Their asking price was, of course, way more than what I knew I could get it for if I went online.</li>
            <li>I just love this smell</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s from me, top amazon reviewer, Jim-Jam</li>
            <li>He loves it and its is his favorite.</li>
            <li>it was what i expect love it ❤</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes, I&#x27;d recommended it as a gift or something to buy yourself.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the size.</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite fragrance it is so refreshing that I use it as aroma therapy for my migraine headaches.  </li>
            <li>I ran out, so I needed some more, hence my order to get some more of it.</li>
            <li>&amp; i&#x27;ve got many compliments from both genders.</li>
            <li>I have always paid more than$100 for this bottle :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>More for the money.</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon made me feel more confident that if I encountered any problems with my order that they would resolve it.</li>
            <li>but most importantly it&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li>It wood be better to buy it at a department store.</li>
            <li>Code is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s (and my) favorite.</li>
            <li>I was happy that it was the real thing and not a knock off</li>
            <li>I have used and enjoyed this product for years but the product I got from amazon has almost no smell.</li>
            <li>Great product, Thanks.</li>
            <li>Get many compliments.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, the ladies love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was just like purchasing from the mall but better.  </li>
            <li>Better price</li>
            <li>For the price :)</li>
            <li>does smell ok, but</li>
            <li>My favorite for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love, I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li>So pleased</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>SURE TO KEEP YOUR COLOGNE IN THEIR BOX.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly a skin scent.</li>
            <li>Its sexy.</li>
            <li>Bought my husband this on a whim and it turned out to be one of his favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>Of course you should test this out first at a store to see if you like it, but once you do this is a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Of course, what it is good for me may be just &amp;#34;Meh!&amp;#34; for you, so try to get a sample at the mall first.</li>
            <li>From the first time I put some on, my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of sweet smelling, the description describes it as a blend of apple, lavender, cumin, citrus, and woods.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use any time I have a special occasion to attend!</li>
            <li>worth trying..best parfume for guys!!</li>
            <li>I personally feel Armani Code is just best used in \\&quot;special occasions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You smell amazing.&amp;#34; It is a great professional smell.</li>
            <li>For an even better mix I spray it with Cool Water for an even better stimulanting affect.  </li>
            <li>cheap after shave lotion smells better than this.</li>
            <li>I love that the first thing I hear from my date is how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>nice smooth sweet scent</li>
            <li>Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I think it works best as a daytime fragrance in all seasons other than summer.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It is just too easy meeting the ladies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others that I liked the smell more, but the fragrance wore off much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s still noticeable.</li>
            <li>this is the best I have used, by far, you can smell the difference this is really high quality</li>
            <li>for me;  however,  BLACK CODE is an excellent alternative.  </li>
            <li>but this one is light and sweet that lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>It is bold, yet not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a woman dislike it, in fact, most like it tremendously.</li>
            <li>Not so strong but not too light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for wearing lightly, can be a tad strong.</li>
            <li>Bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li>and my wife seems to really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>For $70-$80 this is a fantastic cologne that WILL garner the attention of those who smell it.</li>
            <li>despite its cheap prize-made me lil nervous about its originality-</li>
            <li>I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!</li>
            <li>Great smelling cologne I&#x27;ve been wearing for several years and always get compliments.</li>
            <li>Price is great through Amazon definitely then place to purchase from.</li>
            <li>Comparing all the known indicators of whether or not the fragrance was genuine or counterfeit, the Armani Code I received is without a doubt genuine.</li>
            <li>Great way to save money on the same thing that is in store!!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample and was hooked after one use.</li>
            <li>Great product just the same as we have purchased from the departments stores.</li>
            <li>Never found it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Should be more economical.</li>
            <li>Smells great on my bf, he wears it daily.</li>
            <li>Good as an elegant present, as well.</li>
            <li>Great price and spells like the real thing I have grown to love.....holds up very well throughout the evening.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite cologne out there right now.</li>
            <li>And its not too strong but just strong enough to make you smell good all day.</li>
            <li>Smells powdery at first but then becomes much better.</li>
            <li>I must say that a got an original one!!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I like the original Giorgio Armani Aquafina</li>
            <li>El perfume es 100% original.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty safe fragrance that is by no means overpowering or offensive.</li>
            <li>This is a great combo of the two and worth the extra coin for it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the right scent, and given the reviews were great, I ordered it.</li>
            <li>If you want a cologne that&#x27;s not overwhelming, but just pleasant all day long the code is awesome.</li>
            <li>I use this when on dates or special occasions.</li>
            <li>Everything came as expected great smell</li>
            <li>smell is true to the smell from the store.</li>
            <li>Should last a good while.</li>
            <li>you have my full recommendation to purchase this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells good but dont last</li>
            <li>This sweet smelling cologne leaves a trail after you wherever you go.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty strong smell, one spray will do two might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its pretty strong, but can attract a lot of attention.</li>
            <li>, Smells Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped this quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and have stayed loyal to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments on this and has become my new favortie.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading great reviews on a few websites.</li>
            <li>Not over powering if used modestly and will offer a confident approach to each day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique,  but not strange definitely sexy and seductive.</li>
            <li>shower gel and after shave)it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>and when you don&#x27;t have to enter the mall during the holidays it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>got this perfume and a bunch of other stuff for my husband as a 2nd anniversary gift, he said its his fav perfume and best one he owned yet, he wears it everywhere!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s so good, I prefer to wear it on special occasions like a few examples above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light sexy never overpowering cologne I would not live without</li>
            <li>I have bought Armani colognes from department stores in the past and they were all great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long liked this cologne.</li>
            <li>Armani Code to me smells like a nice, high quality vanilla mixed with powder and a mild lemon citrus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recieved a few nice compliments whenever I&#x27;ve used the genuine article before the purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery...</li>
            <li>The seller may not have intentionally tampered with the product, it may be an old bottle or something, but regardless, you&#x27;re better off spending a little more at a store for the genuine article</li>
            <li>but he likes this product very much</li>
            <li>Exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li>This cologne last all day and works :) all night.</li>
            <li>It does usually last most of the day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I could say after I smelled this cologne for the first time in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>People love the smell &amp; always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for picking up girls.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the Armani Code came in and I began &amp;#34;my research&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>You get larger quantity for a better price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Overall the ladies still love it even though someone else will most likely have it on everywhere you go.</li>
            <li>Your significant other will love it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday present, as Armani Code is a favorite of his.</li>
            <li>so I would always go test it at a store first.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but wonderful.</li>
            <li>LIGHTING SUCH AS PLACING IT ON TOP OF YOUR DRAWER.</li>
            <li>The real thing!</li>
            <li>I cannot remember how many &amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34; I get from total strangers everywhere</li>
            <li>Not too strong or overpowering, but intriguing at the same time.</li>
            <li>My fav secant smells classy and rich</li>
            <li>The shipment was received quickly, and the product was new.  </li>
            <li>This one smells more of alcohol and doesnt last like the real stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The odor its great, no doubt about it, but it did not last as much as I expected, Dont know how to tell if its real or not.</li>
            <li>I can report that my purchase is the real deal and smells exactly like the tester I got at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Product I received smelled exactly like AXE body spray (which I absolutely despise).  </li>
            <li>While the packaging and fragrance seemed pretty accurate it did not last at all.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more when this runs dry but seeing as how I got the 4.2 oz bottle</li>
            <li>My wife loves it too, but the only thing I dont like is that the smell seems to ware off very quickly.</li>
            <li>as a heads up, but this is a rather large size.</li>
            <li>I would definently recomend it to anyone that loves bunnies and wants to smell like sex with a taste of the rainbow.</li>
            <li>Lil musky but not to much</li>
            <li>The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt.</li>
            <li>It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent.</li>
            <li>I was really into it</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am very picky on cologne-</li>
            <li>This is the real deal</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Not the real deal, I really expected more from amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the 4.2 oz is huge and worth the money it seriously lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of the original Armani simply because it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;right</li>
            <li>Smells great but the first time it shipped I received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li>Was a present for my son, he was very happy, especially that the size is bigger than he expected.</li>
            <li>The reason is \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; is a lighter fragrance and more watered down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Calvin Klein&#x27;s Escape for years, to decent favor.</li>
            <li>But when I bought this, I can&#x27;t go out without at least one person saying \\&quot;Wow, you smell good.</li>
            <li>It was designed for a lighter scent for short periods of use (grabbing a quick drink after work etc.).      </li>
            <li>The caveat to all this, and the main reason for the one star is because Amazon won&#x27;t let you return flammable materials, so this product can&#x27;t be returned if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend vendor to anyone.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d wear during days or nights with high humidity or heat.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest you pick up a 4.2 oz or the largest size they sell..</li>
            <li>After a good few months of use the bottle ran out and just now over a year later I ordered a new bottle.</li>
            <li>With the 4.2 Oz bottle its sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I normally cycle between</li>
            <li>2nd time around ....and still worth it</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price and the fact that the scent isn&#x27;t exactly SEX IN A BOTTLE like everyone claims</li>
            <li>Just Amazing dry down.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this cologne, so when is small bottle was completed he ask me to get some more for him.</li>
            <li>A musky smell, long lasting, just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to test it out in the wild and see how the opposite sex react to it ;).</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Just wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s by the way</li>
            <li>fragrance is so soft</li>
            <li>However, I can guarantee that after a few trials, you&#x27;ll want to go for this large bottle ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a 6-7/10 cologne that&#x27;s slightly above Axe with decent projection.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product just next time I will be buying it from a store nearby.</li>
            <li>very strong at first, so don&#x27;t go crazy with it.  </li>
            <li>This points to some dilution at some point with water or alcohol (which later evaporate, leaving you with less scent than originally anticipated).</li>
            <li>......I will stick with Acqua Di Gio with an occasional spray of Armani Code Sport [which at least has more defined citrus notes].</li>
            <li>Do not be fooled by other reviews,I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, I know the real deal and this is not it!</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile back, it has last me quite sometime, but definitely found it exactly my type.</li>
            <li>Actually had to tell my fella to back off a little since it smelled so strongly.  </li>
            <li>I expected a more unique and longer lasting fragrance from something this expensive.</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not last as long as department stores.  </li>
            <li>Usually with the genuine article, one to two spurts is enough to attract attention, whereas with this one 3-4 spurts still has me wondering if it will be observable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li>Not too musky but masculine enough for men.  </li>
            <li>If you want a cologne to last a long time (which I wanted), or at least for an entire day of classes... make sure you buy \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; and NOT \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; or EDT.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I had was about 1/4 the size of this one, and it lasted a long time in itself, but the huge bottle on here was the same price as the small bottle in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought this yesterday through amazon, I am not sure if this is original or not, but it just smells like after shave lotion and dosent last long.</li>
            <li>I had read some review about the scent being not long lasting</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, if someone does get close up you&#x27;ll smell good.</li>
            <li> I originally had 1.7ozs of this and bought this 4.2oz for (what I thought was) a great price!  </li>

            <li> First of all, five stars for the great scent!  </li>

            <li> Very nice smell and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> scent smells great and light; a nice sexiness to it without the dirt-man feel.</li>
            <li> but it is in fact simply a good sophisticated cologne.</li>
            <li> Each person interprets smell in their own way.</li>
            <li> Good Price, better than in store.</li>
            <li> I have done my fair share of cologne shopping and Armani Code is by far and away the best scent I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own yet...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m told I spell nice...</li>
            <li> that you know will provide you with the kind of quality you&#x27;d expect from a name brand cologne like Armani.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my husbands birthday, I had smelled a magazine sample and liked the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li> this is a great fragrance that is not overpowering and very complimentary.</li>
            <li> I paid $70 for this bottle and I feel great about it compared to the $90 i paid for the original bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great, worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a very good cologne, not too strong, not too light, and it stays on for HOURS.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance that is not overbearing and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong but it lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I like how I think the scent is liked by many because I don&#x27;t like overbearing/offensive scents.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I get more complements when wearing this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Their asking price was, of course, way more than what I knew I could get it for if I went online.</li>
            <li> I just love this smell</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s from me, top amazon reviewer, Jim-Jam</li>
            <li> He loves it and its is his favorite.</li>
            <li> it was what i expect love it ❤</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, I&#x27;d recommended it as a gift or something to buy yourself.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the size.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite fragrance it is so refreshing that I use it as aroma therapy for my migraine headaches.  </li>
            <li> I ran out, so I needed some more, hence my order to get some more of it.</li>
            <li> &amp; i&#x27;ve got many compliments from both genders.</li>
            <li> I have always paid more than$100 for this bottle :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> More for the money.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon made me feel more confident that if I encountered any problems with my order that they would resolve it.</li>
            <li> but most importantly it&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li> It wood be better to buy it at a department store.</li>
            <li> Code is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s (and my) favorite.</li>
            <li> I was happy that it was the real thing and not a knock off</li>
            <li> I have used and enjoyed this product for years but the product I got from amazon has almost no smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, Thanks.</li>
            <li> Get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, the ladies love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was just like purchasing from the mall but better.  </li>
            <li> Better price</li>
            <li> For the price :)</li>
            <li> does smell ok, but</li>
            <li> My favorite for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love, I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> So pleased</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> SURE TO KEEP YOUR COLOGNE IN THEIR BOX.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly a skin scent.</li>
            <li> Its sexy.</li>
            <li> Bought my husband this on a whim and it turned out to be one of his favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li> Of course you should test this out first at a store to see if you like it, but once you do this is a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Of course, what it is good for me may be just &amp;#34;Meh!&amp;#34; for you, so try to get a sample at the mall first.</li>
            <li> From the first time I put some on, my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li> Kind of sweet smelling, the description describes it as a blend of apple, lavender, cumin, citrus, and woods.  </li>
            <li> I love it and use any time I have a special occasion to attend!</li>
            <li> worth trying..best parfume for guys!!</li>
            <li> I personally feel Armani Code is just best used in \\&quot;special occasions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You smell amazing.&amp;#34; It is a great professional smell.</li>
            <li> For an even better mix I spray it with Cool Water for an even better stimulanting affect.  </li>
            <li> cheap after shave lotion smells better than this.</li>
            <li> I love that the first thing I hear from my date is how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> nice smooth sweet scent</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I think it works best as a daytime fragrance in all seasons other than summer.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It is just too easy meeting the ladies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others that I liked the smell more, but the fragrance wore off much faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s still noticeable.</li>
            <li> this is the best I have used, by far, you can smell the difference this is really high quality</li>
            <li> for me;  however,  BLACK CODE is an excellent alternative.  </li>
            <li> but this one is light and sweet that lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> It is bold, yet not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a woman dislike it, in fact, most like it tremendously.</li>
            <li> Not so strong but not too light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for wearing lightly, can be a tad strong.</li>
            <li> Bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li> and my wife seems to really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> For $70-$80 this is a fantastic cologne that WILL garner the attention of those who smell it.</li>
            <li> despite its cheap prize-made me lil nervous about its originality-</li>
            <li> I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne I&#x27;ve been wearing for several years and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Price is great through Amazon definitely then place to purchase from.</li>
            <li> Comparing all the known indicators of whether or not the fragrance was genuine or counterfeit, the Armani Code I received is without a doubt genuine.</li>
            <li> Great way to save money on the same thing that is in store!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample and was hooked after one use.</li>
            <li> Great product just the same as we have purchased from the departments stores.</li>
            <li> Never found it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Should be more economical.</li>
            <li> Smells great on my bf, he wears it daily.</li>
            <li> Good as an elegant present, as well.</li>
            <li> Great price and spells like the real thing I have grown to love.....holds up very well throughout the evening.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite cologne out there right now.</li>
            <li> And its not too strong but just strong enough to make you smell good all day.</li>
            <li> Smells powdery at first but then becomes much better.</li>
            <li> I must say that a got an original one!!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I like the original Giorgio Armani Aquafina</li>
            <li> El perfume es 100% original.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty safe fragrance that is by no means overpowering or offensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great combo of the two and worth the extra coin for it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the right scent, and given the reviews were great, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> If you want a cologne that&#x27;s not overwhelming, but just pleasant all day long the code is awesome.</li>
            <li> I use this when on dates or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected great smell</li>
            <li> smell is true to the smell from the store.</li>
            <li> Should last a good while.</li>
            <li> you have my full recommendation to purchase this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells good but dont last</li>
            <li> This sweet smelling cologne leaves a trail after you wherever you go.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty strong smell, one spray will do two might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its pretty strong, but can attract a lot of attention.</li>
            <li> , Smells Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and have stayed loyal to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Received many compliments on this and has become my new favortie.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading great reviews on a few websites.</li>
            <li> Not over powering if used modestly and will offer a confident approach to each day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The smell is unique,  but not strange definitely sexy and seductive.</li>
            <li> shower gel and after shave)it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> and when you don&#x27;t have to enter the mall during the holidays it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> got this perfume and a bunch of other stuff for my husband as a 2nd anniversary gift, he said its his fav perfume and best one he owned yet, he wears it everywhere!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so good, I prefer to wear it on special occasions like a few examples above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A light sexy never overpowering cologne I would not live without</li>
            <li> I have bought Armani colognes from department stores in the past and they were all great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long liked this cologne.</li>
            <li> Armani Code to me smells like a nice, high quality vanilla mixed with powder and a mild lemon citrus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recieved a few nice compliments whenever I&#x27;ve used the genuine article before the purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery...</li>
            <li> The seller may not have intentionally tampered with the product, it may be an old bottle or something, but regardless, you&#x27;re better off spending a little more at a store for the genuine article</li>
            <li> but he likes this product very much</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li> This cologne last all day and works :) all night.</li>
            <li> It does usually last most of the day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I could say after I smelled this cologne for the first time in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> People love the smell &amp; always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for picking up girls.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the Armani Code came in and I began &amp;#34;my research&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You get larger quantity for a better price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Overall the ladies still love it even though someone else will most likely have it on everywhere you go.</li>
            <li> Your significant other will love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday present, as Armani Code is a favorite of his.</li>
            <li> so I would always go test it at a store first.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but wonderful.</li>
            <li> LIGHTING SUCH AS PLACING IT ON TOP OF YOUR DRAWER.</li>
            <li> The real thing!</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how many &amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34; I get from total strangers everywhere</li>
            <li> Not too strong or overpowering, but intriguing at the same time.</li>
            <li> My fav secant smells classy and rich</li>
            <li> The shipment was received quickly, and the product was new.  </li>
            <li> This one smells more of alcohol and doesnt last like the real stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor its great, no doubt about it, but it did not last as much as I expected, Dont know how to tell if its real or not.</li>
            <li> I can report that my purchase is the real deal and smells exactly like the tester I got at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Product I received smelled exactly like AXE body spray (which I absolutely despise).  </li>
            <li> While the packaging and fragrance seemed pretty accurate it did not last at all.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more when this runs dry but seeing as how I got the 4.2 oz bottle</li>
            <li> My wife loves it too, but the only thing I dont like is that the smell seems to ware off very quickly.</li>
            <li> as a heads up, but this is a rather large size.</li>
            <li> I would definently recomend it to anyone that loves bunnies and wants to smell like sex with a taste of the rainbow.</li>
            <li> Lil musky but not to much</li>
            <li> The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt.</li>
            <li> It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent.</li>
            <li> I was really into it</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am very picky on cologne-</li>
            <li> This is the real deal</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not the real deal, I really expected more from amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the 4.2 oz is huge and worth the money it seriously lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of the original Armani simply because it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;right</li>
            <li> Smells great but the first time it shipped I received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Was a present for my son, he was very happy, especially that the size is bigger than he expected.</li>
            <li> The reason is \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; is a lighter fragrance and more watered down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Calvin Klein&#x27;s Escape for years, to decent favor.</li>
            <li> But when I bought this, I can&#x27;t go out without at least one person saying \\&quot;Wow, you smell good.</li>
            <li> It was designed for a lighter scent for short periods of use (grabbing a quick drink after work etc.).      </li>
            <li> The caveat to all this, and the main reason for the one star is because Amazon won&#x27;t let you return flammable materials, so this product can&#x27;t be returned if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend vendor to anyone.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d wear during days or nights with high humidity or heat.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest you pick up a 4.2 oz or the largest size they sell..</li>
            <li> After a good few months of use the bottle ran out and just now over a year later I ordered a new bottle.</li>
            <li> With the 4.2 Oz bottle its sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally cycle between</li>
            <li> 2nd time around ....and still worth it</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price and the fact that the scent isn&#x27;t exactly SEX IN A BOTTLE like everyone claims</li>
            <li> Just Amazing dry down.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, so when is small bottle was completed he ask me to get some more for him.</li>
            <li> A musky smell, long lasting, just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to test it out in the wild and see how the opposite sex react to it ;).</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Just wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s by the way</li>
            <li> fragrance is so soft</li>
            <li> However, I can guarantee that after a few trials, you&#x27;ll want to go for this large bottle ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a 6-7/10 cologne that&#x27;s slightly above Axe with decent projection.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product just next time I will be buying it from a store nearby.</li>
            <li> very strong at first, so don&#x27;t go crazy with it.  </li>
            <li> This points to some dilution at some point with water or alcohol (which later evaporate, leaving you with less scent than originally anticipated).</li>
            <li> ......I will stick with Acqua Di Gio with an occasional spray of Armani Code Sport [which at least has more defined citrus notes].</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by other reviews,I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, I know the real deal and this is not it!</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back, it has last me quite sometime, but definitely found it exactly my type.</li>
            <li> Actually had to tell my fella to back off a little since it smelled so strongly.  </li>
            <li> I expected a more unique and longer lasting fragrance from something this expensive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not last as long as department stores.  </li>
            <li> Usually with the genuine article, one to two spurts is enough to attract attention, whereas with this one 3-4 spurts still has me wondering if it will be observable.  </li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li> Not too musky but masculine enough for men.  </li>
            <li> If you want a cologne to last a long time (which I wanted), or at least for an entire day of classes... make sure you buy \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; and NOT \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; or EDT.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I had was about 1/4 the size of this one, and it lasted a long time in itself, but the huge bottle on here was the same price as the small bottle in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday through amazon, I am not sure if this is original or not, but it just smells like after shave lotion and dosent last long.</li>
            <li> I had read some review about the scent being not long lasting</li>
            <li> Normally one tiny spray is all you need but with this I could use half the bottle and not smell a thing.</li>
            <li> which proves that whoever amazon originally got this product from sold them some bad merchandise.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but just be careful you don&#x27;t squirt too much as you can very easily over-saturate yourself /</li>
            <li> So far every time I&#x27;ve wore it I&#x27;ve received compliments from  my girl and other people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Problem quickly presented itself when in the coming days after putting some on (3 squirts of the cologne), the smell seemed to be quite weak.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and if you&#x27;re one that recycles your outside layer for more than one wear, or you get too close to your dirty clothes, you&#x27;ll note that you can still smell it days later.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and wont fade through out the day.</li>
            <li> : After doing some research online I found out an easy way to see if you received a faulty or fake product is to compare the numbers found at the bottom of the box to the numbers found in the label at the bottom of the bottle, they should match and mine</li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> But regarding plain old Armani Code - do me a favor, save your money.</li>
            <li> Other purchasers of this had mentioned similar concerns, but I thought there was no way Amazon would sell inferior goods or knockoffs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, if you&#x27;re looking for this particular scent, its hard to find (which is why I bought from Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it as a present to my brother in law in his late 30&#x27;s and father in his early 50&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I typically get several comments on the fragrance when I wear Armani Code.</li>
            <li> If you do buy from Amazon, maybe the one you receive is legit and doesn&#x27;t have the problem of fading quickly which mine unfortunately does.  </li>
            <li> Best&lt;br /&gt;advice:  use it sparingly;  a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> I have gotten pretty heavy into the fragrance world over the past few years and smelled a lot juices.</li>
            <li> The perfume is a bit expensive compared to its worth though.</li>
            <li> I have had compliments from other men, women, all kinds of people in all kinds of situations.</li>
            <li> Package and other things are all fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I soon realized that the scent lasted only 1 hour or so instead of the usual 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> You can wear it at night also year round as long as the temperature is under 75 degrees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously worn the same cologne for the past 5 years, just made the switch to Armani Code.  </li>
            <li> I think it was heavily watered down and is total waste .</li>
            <li> bought Armani Code and a couple of other colognes from Amazon and they all seemed to be watered down.</li>
            <li> The problem is that as other negative posters have claimed, the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> The second time it came it was leaking, but at least my gym bag doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty socks anymore.  </li>
            <li> watered down bottle i got....</li>
            <li> Spray and gone in less than 5 min.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this fragrance at a department store previously</li>
            <li> I think it was heavily watered down and probably a knock off.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, Little on the spicy side</li>
            <li> little pricey</li>
            <li> If you think youre getting a crazy deal, please reconsider going to a department store and buying the real thing</li>
            <li> This scent is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> buy this if you dont want to waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I paid $80 for the bottle and a few extras (</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy it from a department store, at least you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> make your coworkers hate you for squirting too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that perfumes are fake, watered down etc!!!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Some of these are watered down or fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product I received appeared to be a watered down counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I sprayed it on me before going to sleep to see what it smelled like</li>
            <li> Seriously just buy this.</li>
            <li> This scent is on the lighter side so two sprays around the neck would be sufficient to be noticed yet subtle.</li>
            <li> Never good at describing scents</li>
            <li> So frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever blind buy something such as cologne, you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this went wrong so badly as the seller is Amazon LLC</li>
            <li> Being a regular buyer at Amazon, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doing research online trying to pick out a cologne is difficult.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you it just drives the ladies crazy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you sick or anything</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon for endorsing fake products and stealing their customers money.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best sent on the market.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect. Great scent. Not overpowering and lasts..</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Armani scent to date.  It is bold, yet not too overwhelming.  Of course you should test this out first at a store to see if you like it, but once you do this is a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never recieved more compliments in my life until I started wearing the cologne.  Let me tell you it just drives the ladies crazy.  When I go to the bar, I am like a fox in a hen house.  It is just too easy meeting the ladies.  Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> Armani Code? I just think I broke the Code: the scent of liquid baby powder. Thanks but no thanks......I will stick with Acqua Di Gio with an occasional spray of Armani Code Sport [which at least has more defined citrus notes]. But regarding plain old Armani Code - do me a favor, save your money.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and not too strong.  This is one of my two favorites.  Amazon shipped this quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of perfume that women love to smell when are just having a perfect moment with their mens.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty strong smell, one spray will do two might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest to spray on the neck or wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent, everyone likes this...</li>
            <li> I have bought Armani colognes from department stores in the past and they were all great. The scent stayed on for the entire day after you wore the cologne in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Armani Code and a couple of other colognes from Amazon and they all seemed to be watered down. I noticed the difference immediately after wearing them and the smell didn&#x27;t last for even a couple of hours. I won&#x27;t buy colognes from Amazon and rather stick with department stores such as Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Product as expected. Service and delivery prompt and safe. Would highly recommend vendor to anyone.</li>
            <li> This scent is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for everyday use. Not over powering if used modestly and will offer a confident approach to each day.</li>
            <li> I like how this cologne hangs with you all day - you can put it on in the morning and you still have it by the end of the day.  It has a refreshing hint to it and my wife seems to really enjoy it.  I have tried others, of course, but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance that is not overbearing and not too sweet.  Received many compliments on this and has become my new favortie.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, an excellent smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Get lots of compliments on the way I smell. One girl actually stopped, turned around and exlaimed &amp;#34;WOW! You smell amazing.&amp;#34; It is a great professional smell. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes the bunnies fall at your feet! This cologne last all day and works :) all night. I love it. When im eating skittles the aroma makes my tounge swell up. I would definently recomend it to anyone that loves bunnies and wants to smell like sex with a taste of the rainbow.</li>
            <li> no he recibido mi perfume aun quiero que me dejen saber que es lo que pasa, porque debi&amp;oacute; llegar el 1 de este mes y no tengo ni rastros de donde esta quisiera una pronta respuesta, les escribo por este medio porque no tenia otro. por favor necesito respuesta,,gracias</li>
            <li> The scent has gotten me compliments from all the ladies. It does usually last most of the day. I use this when on dates or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have been using Armani Code for over 5 years. I am very satisfied with the quality and fragrance of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The Code brings complements from all ladys, wherever I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. I get more complements when wearing this cologne.  All Armani products for men are incredible</li>
            <li> does not last, 2 hours max, not the same as before</li>
            <li> Wow. Just wow. That&#x27;s all I could say after I smelled this cologne for the first time in Macy&#x27;s. Their asking price was, of course, way more than what I knew I could get it for if I went online. I&#x27;d recommend you splurge on the big size model if you can. It&#x27;s worth the investment. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong but it lasts a good amount of time. Can&#x27;t wait to test it out in the wild and see how the opposite sex react to it ;).</li>
            <li> I just love this smell and I receive lot of compliments by women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of the original Armani simply because it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;right for me;  however,  BLACK CODE is an excellent alternative.  Best&lt;br /&gt;advice:  use it sparingly;  a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cologne, not too strong, not too light, and it stays on for HOURS. Seriously I sprayed it on me before going to sleep to see what it smelled like and here I am about 14 hours later and i can still smell it on me! Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price and the fact that the scent isn&#x27;t exactly SEX IN A BOTTLE like everyone claims but it is in fact simply a good sophisticated cologne. Will be ordering more when this runs dry but seeing as how I got the 4.2 oz bottle i&#x27;m hoping that isn&#x27;t for a while!  Edit: I have upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars. After a good few months of use the bottle ran out and just now over a year later I ordered a new bottle. I paid $70 for this bottle and I feel great about it compared to the $90 i paid for the original bottle. For $70-$80 this is a fantastic cologne that WILL garner the attention of those who smell it. I have had compliments from other men, women, all kinds of people in all kinds of situations. Seriously just buy this. Add it to your cart, check out, and spray it on yourself. You will NOT regret this purchase. And that&#x27;s from me, top amazon reviewer, Jim-Jam ;)</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he loved it!! Not to mention that it smells great, arrived on time with no problems.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne just about every day. I get compliments here and there. It&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s still noticeable. Perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Had lots of compliments about smelling good.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my son.  He loves it and its is his favorite.</li>
            <li> I have gotten pretty heavy into the fragrance world over the past few years and smelled a lot juices. I&#x27;ve got my nose on many niche fragrance but still , Armani code , is the best scent I have ever smelled. Just Amazing dry down. seductive.</li>
            <li> Great colgne. Long lasting and wont fade through out the day. I always have girls asking what im wearing. Lil musky but not to much which is why i like it. Cheaper on amazon than in any store.</li>
            <li> Only time I&#x27;ve seen this product at this price! Haven&#x27;t seen it like this since I bought it!</li>
            <li> it was what i expect love it ❤️</li>
            <li> This cologne does not smell like the one I purchased before from department store.&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not last at all, looks like it is fake!&lt;br /&gt;All people who had been riped off with this product we should all file a complaint.&lt;br /&gt;This a scam by amazon</li>
            <li> Only scent i like my hubby wearing!!!</li>
            <li> what a buy looking forward to picking up another bottle for my step son&#x27;s graduation.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading great reviews on a few websites. It&#x27;s just a 6-7/10 cologne that&#x27;s slightly above Axe with decent projection. It doesn&#x27;t make you sick or anything, it&#x27;s just very generic. Don&#x27;t ever blind buy something such as cologne, you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doing research online trying to pick out a cologne is difficult. Each person interprets smell in their own way. I cannot tell you if you&#x27;re going like the smell of Armani Code, but I can guarantee that you will be complimented on it. Code is not overpowering, at time i might even wish the smell lasted a tad bit longer. The smell is unique,  but not strange definitely sexy and seductive.</li>
            <li> The odor its great, no doubt about it, but it did not last as much as I expected, Dont know how to tell if its real or not.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, I&#x27;d recommended it as a gift or something to buy yourself.  I typically get several comments on the fragrance when I wear Armani Code.</li>
            <li> Love it !! :-) It was the best gift for my husband :)</li>
            <li> A Lion all of the ladies want to have sex with. This is especially important for keeping my girlfriend around.</li>
            <li> The best smelling cologne I have ever owned. There are many great smelling colognes out there, but the scent of this cologne lingers on your clothing ALL DAY. That&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not last as long as department stores.  Do yourself a favor and buy it from a department store, at least you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> despite its cheap prize-made me lil nervous about its originality- it came in really good and original package. worth trying..best parfume for guys!!</li>
            <li> It seems like cologne is hit or miss on Amazon.  So frustrating.  I can report that my purchase is the real deal and smells exactly like the tester I got at the mall.  I am VERY happy and I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very strong at first, so don&#x27;t go crazy with it.  The scent will last all day in your shirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Calvin Klein&#x27;s Escape for years, to decent favor. But when I bought this, I can&#x27;t go out without at least one person saying \\&quot;Wow, you smell good. What is that?\\&quot; Since then, it&#x27;s become my go-to cologne. As a cologne snob, I&#x27;ll say, it&#x27;s a perfect evening scent. Not too strong or overpowering, but intriguing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this online as there are always the nay-sayers that say, \\&quot;This smell doesn&#x27;t last.\\&quot; \\&quot;This is definitely the aftershave put into the spray bottle.\\&quot; \\&quot;Ect\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this fragrance already, so I know what this smell smells like already. I had done some shopping in the local Sephora and found their prices for smelly alcohol water to be a bit unfathomable. I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try! The bottle I had was about 1/4 the size of this one, and it lasted a long time in itself, but the huge bottle on here was the same price as the small bottle in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell is true to the smell from the store. It lasts all day, and if you&#x27;re one that recycles your outside layer for more than one wear, or you get too close to your dirty clothes, you&#x27;ll note that you can still smell it days later. The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt. I find that with this one I only need 1 - 3 squirts where my former product (LaCoste) took about 4 - 5 to get the same amount of fragrance and liquid dispensed. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but just be careful you don&#x27;t squirt too much as you can very easily over-saturate yourself / make your coworkers hate you for squirting too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent. I do recommend going to Sephora / Perfumania though to try it out to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> A bit feminine in its fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law.  He loved it.  It was a good value for the price and I was pleased with the size.</li>
            <li> Armani code has one of the best fragrances of any cologne I have smelled! I love it and use any time I have a special occasion to attend!</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for a while now and i receive nothing but compliments on it. I have never had a woman dislike it, in fact, most like it tremendously.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, Little on the spicy side But I like It, Smells Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite fragrance it is so refreshing that I use it as aroma therapy for my migraine headaches.  For an even better mix I spray it with Cool Water for an even better stimulanting affect.  It is always complimented by my patients and friends.</li>
            <li> Smells powdery at first but then becomes much better.</li>
            <li> Great product. I get compliments every time I go with this cologne. If you&#x27;re a cologne buff then this is a must have in your collection.</li>
            <li> RIPPED OFF! Not the real deal, I really expected more from amazon. After spraying what had left of the colognes bought from macys and comparing it to this one it isnot the same, the scent is weaker and different.. Very disappointed in Amazon for endorsing fake products and stealing their customers money. Do not be fooled by other reviews,I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, I know the real deal and this is not it! I feel ripped off..&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After doing some research online I found out an easy way to see if you received a faulty or fake product is to compare the numbers found at the bottom of the box to the numbers found in the label at the bottom of the bottle, they should match and mine didn&#x27;t! which proves that whoever amazon originally got this product from sold them some bad merchandise.</li>
            <li> It almost smells like Raid ( roach spray). For 70$ you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;I thought if I got it, it would been</li>
            <li> Good Price, better than in store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long liked this cologne. I ran out, so I needed some more, hence my order to get some more of it.</li>
            <li> I was really into it &amp; i&#x27;ve got many compliments from both genders. People love the smell &amp; always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for picking up girls.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, so when is small bottle was completed he ask me to get some more for him.</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews before buying anything!!! I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that perfumes are fake, watered down etc!!!&lt;br /&gt;But I must say that a got an original one!!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon!!!</li>
            <li> If you want a cologne that&#x27;s not overwhelming, but just pleasant all day long the code is awesome. Great price too at $72 I have always paid more than$100 for this bottle :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne I&#x27;ve been wearing for several years and always get compliments. Price is great through Amazon definitely then place to purchase from.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. This was a gift for my son. He loves it. Should last a good while. More for the money.</li>
            <li> A great cologne for men, it has a sweet clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> That is so good. Muy bueno</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon made me feel more confident that if I encountered any problems with my order that they would resolve it. Sure enough, the Armani Code came in and I began &amp;#34;my research&amp;#34;. Comparing all the known indicators of whether or not the fragrance was genuine or counterfeit, the Armani Code I received is without a doubt genuine. The scent lasts me all day (8-hours) with no problems and that&#x27;s only using one spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent smells great and light; a nice sexiness to it without the dirt-man feel. It works best for a night out with that special someone. I like how I think the scent is liked by many because I don&#x27;t like overbearing/offensive scents. This scent is on the lighter side so two sprays around the neck would be sufficient to be noticed yet subtle. With the 4.2 Oz bottle its sure to last a long time. A great scent at a great price!</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased product.  Great smell.  Girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. It&#x27;s like a knock off as the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you. Spray and gone in less than 5 min.</li>
            <li> I like the original Giorgio Armani Aquafina</li>
            <li> The title sums it up. I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and have stayed loyal to the fragrance. I always get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it but most importantly it&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance I&#x27;ve smelled to date.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most exquisite and refined fragrances for men you can get.  Of course, what it is good for me may be just &amp;#34;Meh!&amp;#34; for you, so try to get a sample at the mall first.</li>
            <li> Was VERY pleased with this product! Great way to save money on the same thing that is in store!! Will definitely use this site again.</li>
            <li> It is a great perfume ، excellent aroma .</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Some of these are watered down or fake. It wood be better to buy it at a department store. Code is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the 4.2 oz is huge and worth the money it seriously lasts forever! And its not too strong but just strong enough to make you smell good all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, I shopped around first and amazon had the best price.  I would definitely buy it again here.  You get larger quantity for a better price.</li>
            <li> Second or third time purchasing this cologne.  Kind of pricey, but it lasts me forever and has a great scent without being too overbearing.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for several years. I&#x27;m often asked the name of the cologne I have on. It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s (and my) favorite.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected great smell I was happy that it was the real thing and not a knock off</li>
            <li> Fits me perfect (The women say so). Not so strong but not too light. It is my favorite cologne out there right now. Just spray it twice and the scent lasts forever, no lie. I recommend it and give it a 10 out of 10. I&#x27;ve given it as a present to my brother in law in his late 30&#x27;s and father in his early 50&#x27;s and both loved it, as well as their wives. I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s by the way so i&#x27;d say every age group loves it.</li>
            <li> My son received this as a graduation gift from a friend of mine that was 6 years ago and he still uses it.  It&#x27;s not over powering, great scent for a man.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years but the product that I just got from amazon has almost no smell. I think it was heavily watered down and is total waste . Being a regular buyer at Amazon, I am very disappointed. Not sure how this went wrong so badly as the seller is Amazon LLC itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give no star at all. Grrrrrrr</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this fragrance at a department store previously so I know what it smells like and how long it lasts.  Unfortunately the product I received appeared to be a watered down counterfeit.  While the packaging and fragrance seemed pretty accurate it did not last at all. I will stick to department stores only in the future for all fragrance needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back, it has last me quite sometime, but definitely found it exactly my type. A musky smell, long lasting, just fantastic. 5 star.</li>
            <li> This scent is becoming more and more popular. Almost ever guy I know has owned this once before which takes away the prestige.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s almost immediately noticeable. Overall the ladies still love it even though someone else will most likely have it on everywhere you go. lol</li>
            <li> I expected a more unique and longer lasting fragrance from something this expensive. I guess I will stick to the David Beckhams and Burberry fragrances I normally cycle between</li>
            <li> I have used and enjoyed this product for years but the product I got from amazon has almost no smell. I think it was heavily watered down and probably a knock off. Normally one tiny spray is all you need but with this I could use half the bottle and not smell a thing. I was very disappointed. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Its beyond any ratings......&lt;br /&gt;Its too good of Product......and doesnt need 5 stars......&lt;br /&gt;Its a Billion Star for this Armani Code.....</li>
            <li> let me put it this way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your date/event/night out to start well continue well and end well&lt;br /&gt;then you have my full recommendation to purchase this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so good, I prefer to wear it on special occasions like a few examples above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and probably Allure Chanel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, Thanks.</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday through amazon, I am not sure if this is original or not, but it just smells like after shave lotion and dosent last long. Package and other things are all fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy this if you are looking for some thing special.&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy this if you dont want to waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheap after shave lotion smells better than this.</li>
            <li> if you want to smell like gods this is the one you need to use. I guarantee it it it</li>
            <li> Smells great but the first time it shipped I received the wrong product.  The second time it came it was leaking, but at least my gym bag doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty socks anymore.  I highly recommend the product just next time I will be buying it from a store nearby.</li>
            <li> thi is very good thank you</li>
            <li> Get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Product I received smelled exactly like AXE body spray (which I absolutely despise).  How do I know this?  My roommate wore AXE every day for an entire semester. We aren&#x27;t roommates anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. Love the smell!! Great value for the price. Good as an elegant present, as well.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample and was hooked after one use. Although I paid $80 for the bottle and a few extras (shower gel and after shave)it is well worth it. I&#x27;ve had the bottle for over a year and 1/3 still remains. No joke, EVERY girl, aunt, coworker, friend, and stranger has complimented me! I love that the first thing I hear from my date is how nice I smell. Never good at describing scents but this one is light and sweet that lasts most of the day. I have done my fair share of cologne shopping and Armani Code is by far and away the best scent I&#x27;ve come across. I always recommend it to friends and will definitely be buying a second bottle! Bottom line, the ladies love it so I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was just like purchasing from the mall but better.  Better price and when you don&#x27;t have to enter the mall during the holidays it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is the real thing. Actually had to tell my fella to back off a little since it smelled so strongly.  Great product just the same as we have purchased from the departments stores.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t gotten me laid on it&#x27;s own yet...but I&#x27;m told I spell nice...so there&#x27;s that...</li>
            <li> Smells great, worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is very nice, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great cologne smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Mmm this stuff is amazing!!! Your significant other will love it</li>
            <li> You know that tag commercial that makes women flock towards the man wearing it. Well it wasn&#x27;t tag it was this!</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments on this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He has the department store one as well. They both look the same and smell the same. It last the same amount of time and if it didn&#x27;t,he would know. He is picky about things like this. I was happy with my purchase ESP. For the price :)</li>
            <li> nice smooth sweet scent</li>
            <li> El perfume es 100% original. Fue entregado en el lapso de tiempo establecido y en las condiciones ofrecidas en la publicacion.</li>
            <li> I have the identical cologne that I purchased at Macy&#x27;s. This one smells more of alcohol and doesnt last like the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell ok, but men knowing how Armani Code is one of the longest lasting colognes out there, this one doesnt measure up.&lt;br /&gt;So the price for this was sufficient. If you think youre getting a crazy deal, please reconsider going to a department store and buying the real thing</li>
            <li> Yes, the scent of this is great.  From the first time I put some on, my wife loved it.  Problem quickly presented itself when in the coming days after putting some on (3 squirts of the cologne), the smell seemed to be quite weak.  Other purchasers of this had mentioned similar concerns, but I thought there was no way Amazon would sell inferior goods or knockoffs.  I&#x27;m beginning to wonder now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you&#x27;re looking for this particular scent, its hard to find (which is why I bought from Amazon).  If you do buy from Amazon, maybe the one you receive is legit and doesn&#x27;t have the problem of fading quickly which mine unfortunately does.  Disappointing given all the years of purchases from Amazon, I&#x27;ve never encountered this kind of issue.</li>
            <li> this item was for my son, he loves this cologne and does all the ladies.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;a little pricey but he likes this product very much</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday present, as Armani Code is a favorite of his. I know it will please him!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for when you want to dress up or want to be noticed.  its pretty strong, but can attract a lot of attention.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for a couple of years.  Never found it for such a great price.  The product is great as always.  Smells great on most, some peoples body chemistry doesn&#x27;t always work with this cologne though so I would always go test it at a store first.</li>
            <li> Best price &amp; dependable shipping.  2nd purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite for 5 years.  Can&#x27;t beat the essence!</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% recomended</li>
            <li> First of all, five stars for the great scent!  I originally had 1.7ozs of this and bought this 4.2oz for (what I thought was) a great price!  However, I soon realized that the scent lasted only 1 hour or so instead of the usual 4 hours.  The reason is \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; is a lighter fragrance and more watered down.  It was designed for a lighter scent for short periods of use (grabbing a quick drink after work etc.).      If you want a cologne to last a long time (which I wanted), or at least for an entire day of classes... make sure you buy \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; and NOT \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; or EDT.  Big difference in price, but I wish I had stuck with the cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously worn the same cologne for the past 5 years, just made the switch to Armani Code.  Absolutely love, I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Was a present for my son, he was very happy, especially that the size is bigger than he expected. Excellent service, the time we got it was shorter. So pleased</li>
            <li> I have been using this after shave ever since my girlfriend got it for me years ago. she loves the smell and so do i.</li>
            <li> We have bought this for my husband for years.  Love this cologne.  Bottle is huge.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> 2nd time around ....and still worth it</li>
            <li> watered down bottle i got....</li>
            <li> I am very picky on cologne- this is a great fragrance that is not overpowering and very complimentary.</li>
            <li> The shipment was received quickly, and the product was new.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this order.  Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s gift. He mentioned it in passing once and it smells wonderful. Expensive, but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering online because of all the fakes.  I use and have used code for years.  This is the real deal</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve had to date. I&#x27;ve had others that I liked the smell more, but the fragrance wore off much faster. This is a great combo of the two and worth the extra coin for it.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance. The perfume is a bit expensive compared to its worth though. Should be more economical. Bottle shape can be improved too.</li>
            <li> Smells great on my bf, he wears it daily.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the right scent, and given the reviews were great, I ordered it. I&#x27;ve recieved a few nice compliments whenever I&#x27;ve used the genuine article before the purchase of this product.  The problem is that as other negative posters have claimed, the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  This points to some dilution at some point with water or alcohol (which later evaporate, leaving you with less scent than originally anticipated). Usually with the genuine article, one to two spurts is enough to attract attention, whereas with this one 3-4 spurts still has me wondering if it will be observable.  The caveat to all this, and the main reason for the one star is because Amazon won&#x27;t let you return flammable materials, so this product can&#x27;t be returned if you don&#x27;t like it.  The seller may not have intentionally tampered with the product, it may be an old bottle or something, but regardless, you&#x27;re better off spending a little more at a store for the genuine article that you know will provide you with the kind of quality you&#x27;d expect from a name brand cologne like Armani.</li>
            <li> the ladies say it is intoxicating it make them want to hug you&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance is so soft i forget i have it on</li>
            <li> Great price and spells like the real thing I have grown to love.....holds up very well throughout the evening.</li>
            <li> Armani Code is simply my go-to cologne. It smells great and isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, which makes it great for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a heads up, but this is a rather large size. If you&#x27;d like to give this cologne a shot, you may want to look into buying a smaller size. However, I can guarantee that after a few trials, you&#x27;ll want to go for this large bottle ;)</li>
            <li> A light sexy never overpowering cologne I would not live without it.&lt;br /&gt;My partners can&#x27;t get enough and I&#x27;ve used themmmmm</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s and my favorite cologne, good price!</li>
            <li> smells good but dont last</li>
            <li> Armani code is definitely a must have cologne for any collection. I personally feel Armani Code is just best used in \\&quot;special occasions\\&quot;. The reason is because it has this dark/romantic/seductive scent. I&#x27;ve worn it to weddings,night outs and dates. So far every time I&#x27;ve wore it I&#x27;ve received compliments from  my girl and other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO MAKE SURE TO KEEP YOUR COLOGNE IN THEIR BOX. AVOID EXPOSURE TO LIGHTING SUCH AS PLACING IT ON TOP OF YOUR DRAWER. THIS WAY IT COLOGNE LAST&#x27;S LONGER.</li>
            <li> Armani Code to me smells like a nice, high quality vanilla mixed with powder and a mild lemon citrus. I don&#x27;t smell the tobacco note in the fragrance. This cologne smells good. It only lasts about three hours on my skin. It&#x27;s mostly a skin scent. It isn&#x27;t going to project that great. However, if someone does get close up you&#x27;ll smell good. This is a pretty safe fragrance that is by no means overpowering or offensive. I think it works best as a daytime fragrance in all seasons other than summer. You can wear it at night also year round as long as the temperature is under 75 degrees. This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d wear during days or nights with high humidity or heat.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery... Awsome cologne</li>
            <li> got this perfume and a bunch of other stuff for my husband as a 2nd anniversary gift, he said its his fav perfume and best one he owned yet, he wears it everywhere!</li>
            <li> The real thing! I love it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is really good! I would highly suggest you pick up a 4.2 oz or the largest size they sell..</li>
            <li> this is the best I have used, by far, you can smell the difference this is really high quality I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> This sweet smelling cologne leaves a trail after you wherever you go. I cannot remember how many &amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34; I get from total strangers everywhere I go and I have decided to make Armani Code my signature smell!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Its sexy. Period.... lol this cologne is great for almost any occasion. And would smell great at any time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lemon, citrus smell to it. Very sexy, yet still manly. This is the smell of a successful man</li>
            <li> My fav secant smells classy and rich</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my husbands birthday, I had smelled a magazine sample and liked the way it smelled.  I had read some review about the scent being not long lasting and I agree.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought my husband this on a whim and it turned out to be one of his favorite colognes.  Not too musky but masculine enough for men.  Kind of sweet smelling, the description describes it as a blend of apple, lavender, cumin, citrus, and woods.  I definitely smell the citrus and woods.  I would recommend for wearing lightly, can be a tad strong.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> who deesn&#x27;t like Armani Code.  Great price and quantity.</li>
            <li> My favoite cologne , love it , always get nice compliments .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, It has a great smell! My wife loves it too, but the only thing I dont like is that the smell seems to ware off very quickly. Even when I use alot, the smell wears off in a couple hours. But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was like the fragrance on me.  It gets a lot of compliments from clients and salespeople and strangers and friends</li>
