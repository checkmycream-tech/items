            <li>This product is a superior product to any sold for lip moisturizing.</li>

            <li>Neutrogena is consistently a good buy and good product.</li>
            <li>When I found this I was delighted.  </li>
            <li>The GOOD:  -No</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flavor-free, has SPF 15, and it has the the perfect smooth texture.  </li>

            <li>Offers wonderful moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lip balm!  </li>
            <li>Also, it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth but non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I even contacted the company and they told me nobody had it any more, and, no, they wouldn&#x27;t reconsider their decision.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing better than Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the wheel to push the product up is at the top rather than at the bottom as it is on most lip moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I keep accidentally turning the wheel as I take the top off.</li>
            <li>Me &amp; my wife love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this also because it has sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and my lips are perfectly moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the perfect balance for my preference.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;A satisfied customer</li>
            <li>so I went to the internet and found it and even at a better price.  </li>
            <li>It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried many others...</li>
            <li>This is simply the best lip balm out there.  </li>
            <li>i love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>within two days of using it i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my lower lip</li>
            <li>Always a great item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>tried a multitude of products and nothing works better than this</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for many, many years.</li>
            <li>Love neutrongena lip.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>Amazon shops faster and better than anyone</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>These became my favorite lip moisturizers to use while living in France.  </li>
            <li>It applies very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>-Coverage lasts a long time  -Excellent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine for most</li>
            <li>My mother was in the ICU after her heart surgery and this was the perfect moisturizer for her extremely dry lips.  </li>
            <li>For some reason you can no longer find it as easily as you used to be able to.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to find in NC, happy that I was able to find it online for a very good price.. .....</li>
            <li>Feels like your natural lips in really great condition.</li>
            <li>It came in a pack of 8 and all of them were out of the original packages (I&#x27;m thinking for more convenient shipping)</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend this..</li>
            <li>Thanks to Neutrogena I an a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>This is awesome - not waxy but smooth and really keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li>I needed to fine something that worked without effecting me.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I looked on Amazon and found it.</li>
            <li>I was dubious when I read reviews stating this product could relieve peeling lips overnight, but nothing locally available was working so why not try</li>
            <li>The texture is fantastic and it goes on smoothly thoroughly coating your lips.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very neutral no-taste kind of thing</li>
            <li>I got this free with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s lip balm goes on consistently smoothly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product used to be readily available in stores everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Not Neutrogena --it is silky smooth</li>
            <li>It is not waxy, goes on evenly and smoothly, and moisturizes my lips.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a good amount of time on my lips, keeps my lips soft</li>
            <li>The only kind of lip moisturizer I buy!</li>
            <li>Seems about as good so far, maybe a tiny bit waxier than the original but still better than most.  </li>
            <li>this is the best lip balm everrrr - and hard to find in grocery and/or drug stores.  </li>
            <li>and it does last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>It is the only lip moisturizer that I can use so I am delighted when I can find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I went to this product because my other lip moisturizer was causing an allergic reaction and was causing great pain.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores like so many great products.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it locally but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years.</li>
            <li>I have not.been able to get it locally and was glad to see I could order it on line.</li>
            <li>-SUPER</li>
            <li>Feels good on my dry lips.</li>
            <li>The best lip chap I have ever used, they stopped selling it in Canada, so at least I can get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>and this is the one that came out on top, by far.</li>
            <li>I search for this every store I go into and rarely find it anymore.  </li>
            <li>As I get older I find that even though I live in a fairly humid climate my lips dry easily and even peel (yuck!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless and provides the right amount of moisture so that I can go about my day.</li>
            <li>Granted, he overuses lip balm in general, but it has worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using this chapstick for many years, it is the only one I use.</li>
            <li>Does not burn, even on very chapped lips!</li>
            <li>Excellent, but postage too expensive</li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order of this item and I order 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li>This is the first chapstick that I have found that keeps my lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My favorite for over ten years!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I had really chapped lips (to the point it would bleed at times) and Neutorgena lip moisturizer did</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>No need to say much else.</li>
            <li>and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like them because they&#x27;re not flavored, but I really like them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Our family of five really likes this chapstick.</li>
            <li>As a sportsman, it is always nice to have this product with me to keep my lips moist during a round of golf or watching a sporting event.</li>
            <li>The screw mechanism is on the product end (not the bottom) and doesn&#x27;t tend to work itself forward when in my pocket like most other lip balm containers.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, but heals chapped lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other lip balm!</li>
            <li>I prefer the older variety, but they don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Most lip balms that have sunscreen in them have a funny after taste, even if you are careful not to get any on your inner lips or teeth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lip moisturizer and this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena would do better to place this product near all the other lip aids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled most of my life with sensitive skin, and other lip balm type products like Chapstick, Blistex, and even Burt&#x27;s Bees can cause my lips to get irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li>but all were brand new.  </li>
            <li>and i already ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the lip balms with SPF as I live in florida and lubricating and protecting my lips are of&lt;br /&gt;paramount importance.  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and always have chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>makes lips very soft...</li>
            <li>But I have to say I don&#x27;t wear it only when I forget to bring it with me;-)  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm but it is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole case of this stuff as it is the only chapstick that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips.  </li>
            <li>Like the old saying goes....</li>
            <li>The only thing that really works onin my lips.</li>
            <li>Keeps the lips soft.</li>
            <li>Often, it went on &amp;#34;chunky,&amp;#34; and I was picking at it trying to regain a natural look.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the first one that I have ever used that stayed on long</li>
            <li>It does not have any flavor and it makes my lips so soft and prevents them from cracking.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many lip moisturizers in the past and this is the only one that seems to keep my lips from chafing and</li>
            <li>VERY moisturizing and long wearing.</li>
            <li>It is well priced and exactly what I expected, but doesn&#x27;t come in packaging.</li>
            <li>our favorite lip balm but a bit hard to find locally</li>
            <li>So far not only is it working well for her, but my son, who plays trumpet, no longer goes through a tube a week since he started using this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips appear just balmy, no added color or such.</li>
            <li>This product is a little on the expensive side, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out lips.</li>
            <li>This Lip moisturizer is the only type that helps my very sore lips due to a medical treatment.  </li>
            <li>Just right for the harsh dry  winter of 2015.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Glad to know that I can get it from you, since all of the stores around me have discontinued it!!</li>
            <li> I work out in the sun, camp and spend most of my time in the sun and this is the best sunscreen for lips.  </li>
            <li> Love this kind, not waxy or greasy...just perfect.</li>
            <li> Of course, they discontinued it, as companies seem to do with all good products.  </li>
            <li> Feels good and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> good lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is a superior product to any sold for lip moisturizing.</li>
            <li> And the SPF is good protection as I am in the sun  a lot.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Aveeno version of this lip balm but close.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena is consistently a good buy and good product.</li>
            <li> When I found this I was delighted.  </li>
            <li> The GOOD:  -No</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flavor-free, has SPF 15, and it has the the perfect smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hoe good</li>
            <li> I;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena Formula Lip Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic in one day!</li>
            <li> So glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and the product is great.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a reasonable price when you buy bulk!!  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, very smooth and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Like to have my own stock on hand.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent; I highly recommend it and have a  stick in almost every room for my convenience.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and it came fast with a good price.</li>
            <li> My lips chap very easily</li>
            <li> So glad that I was able to order it on amazon!</li>
            <li> i love how the roller is at the top too!</li>
            <li> Very good lip blam and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Offers wonderful moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lip balm!  </li>
            <li> Also, it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth but non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I even contacted the company and they told me nobody had it any more, and, no, they wouldn&#x27;t reconsider their decision.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing better than Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the wheel to push the product up is at the top rather than at the bottom as it is on most lip moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I keep accidentally turning the wheel as I take the top off.</li>
            <li> Me &amp; my wife love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this also because it has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and my lips are perfectly moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the perfect balance for my preference.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;A satisfied customer</li>
            <li> so I went to the internet and found it and even at a better price.  </li>
            <li> It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried many others...</li>
            <li> This is simply the best lip balm out there.  </li>
            <li> i love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> within two days of using it i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my lower lip</li>
            <li> Always a great item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> tried a multitude of products and nothing works better than this</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Love neutrongena lip.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years.</li>
            <li> Amazon shops faster and better than anyone</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> These became my favorite lip moisturizers to use while living in France.  </li>
            <li> It applies very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> -Coverage lasts a long time  -Excellent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine for most</li>
            <li> My mother was in the ICU after her heart surgery and this was the perfect moisturizer for her extremely dry lips.  </li>
            <li> For some reason you can no longer find it as easily as you used to be able to.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find in NC, happy that I was able to find it online for a very good price.. .....</li>
            <li> Feels like your natural lips in really great condition.</li>
            <li> It came in a pack of 8 and all of them were out of the original packages (I&#x27;m thinking for more convenient shipping)</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend this..</li>
            <li> Thanks to Neutrogena I an a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is awesome - not waxy but smooth and really keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li> I needed to fine something that worked without effecting me.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I looked on Amazon and found it.</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I read reviews stating this product could relieve peeling lips overnight, but nothing locally available was working so why not try</li>
            <li> The texture is fantastic and it goes on smoothly thoroughly coating your lips.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very neutral no-taste kind of thing</li>
            <li> I got this free with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s lip balm goes on consistently smoothly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product used to be readily available in stores everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Not Neutrogena --it is silky smooth</li>
            <li> It is not waxy, goes on evenly and smoothly, and moisturizes my lips.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a good amount of time on my lips, keeps my lips soft</li>
            <li> The only kind of lip moisturizer I buy!</li>
            <li> Seems about as good so far, maybe a tiny bit waxier than the original but still better than most.  </li>
            <li> this is the best lip balm everrrr - and hard to find in grocery and/or drug stores.  </li>
            <li> and it does last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is the only lip moisturizer that I can use so I am delighted when I can find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I went to this product because my other lip moisturizer was causing an allergic reaction and was causing great pain.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores like so many great products.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy it locally but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years.</li>
            <li> I have not.been able to get it locally and was glad to see I could order it on line.</li>
            <li> -SUPER</li>
            <li> Feels good on my dry lips.</li>
            <li> The best lip chap I have ever used, they stopped selling it in Canada, so at least I can get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and this is the one that came out on top, by far.</li>
            <li> I search for this every store I go into and rarely find it anymore.  </li>
            <li> As I get older I find that even though I live in a fairly humid climate my lips dry easily and even peel (yuck!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless and provides the right amount of moisture so that I can go about my day.</li>
            <li> Granted, he overuses lip balm in general, but it has worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this chapstick for many years, it is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> Does not burn, even on very chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Excellent, but postage too expensive</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order of this item and I order 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li> This is the first chapstick that I have found that keeps my lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My favorite for over ten years!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had really chapped lips (to the point it would bleed at times) and Neutorgena lip moisturizer did</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> No need to say much else.</li>
            <li> and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like them because they&#x27;re not flavored, but I really like them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Our family of five really likes this chapstick.</li>
            <li> As a sportsman, it is always nice to have this product with me to keep my lips moist during a round of golf or watching a sporting event.</li>
            <li> The screw mechanism is on the product end (not the bottom) and doesn&#x27;t tend to work itself forward when in my pocket like most other lip balm containers.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, but heals chapped lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip balm!</li>
            <li> I prefer the older variety, but they don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Most lip balms that have sunscreen in them have a funny after taste, even if you are careful not to get any on your inner lips or teeth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lip moisturizer and this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena would do better to place this product near all the other lip aids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled most of my life with sensitive skin, and other lip balm type products like Chapstick, Blistex, and even Burt&#x27;s Bees can cause my lips to get irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li> but all were brand new.  </li>
            <li> and i already ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the lip balms with SPF as I live in florida and lubricating and protecting my lips are of&lt;br /&gt;paramount importance.  </li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and always have chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> makes lips very soft...</li>
            <li> But I have to say I don&#x27;t wear it only when I forget to bring it with me;-)  </li>
            <li> I love this lip balm but it is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole case of this stuff as it is the only chapstick that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips.  </li>
            <li> Like the old saying goes....</li>
            <li> The only thing that really works onin my lips.</li>
            <li> Keeps the lips soft.</li>
            <li> Often, it went on &amp;#34;chunky,&amp;#34; and I was picking at it trying to regain a natural look.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the first one that I have ever used that stayed on long</li>
            <li> It does not have any flavor and it makes my lips so soft and prevents them from cracking.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many lip moisturizers in the past and this is the only one that seems to keep my lips from chafing and</li>
            <li> VERY moisturizing and long wearing.</li>
            <li> It is well priced and exactly what I expected, but doesn&#x27;t come in packaging.</li>
            <li> our favorite lip balm but a bit hard to find locally</li>
            <li> So far not only is it working well for her, but my son, who plays trumpet, no longer goes through a tube a week since he started using this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips appear just balmy, no added color or such.</li>
            <li> This product is a little on the expensive side, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out lips.</li>
            <li> This Lip moisturizer is the only type that helps my very sore lips due to a medical treatment.  </li>
            <li> Just right for the harsh dry  winter of 2015.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t actually dry out my lips, but keeps them moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Most drug stores do not carry this and when they do, it is hard to find because it gets pushed behind the larger Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never completely liquified on me, but if I leave it in the sun, or take it with me on a run it starts to get kinda squishy.     </li>
            <li> Been using this product for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands of lip balm and only been disappointed with the others.  </li>
            <li> We have used various other moisturizers, none of them work like this.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> This Chapstick moisturizers well and doesn&#x27;t leave a built up residue like other chapsticks with multiple use.</li>
            <li> The only lip moisturizer that was comparable was the other Neutrogena one that was discontinued years ago.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying older hard to find products.</li>
            <li> sad part is that this is not available in stores, so i ordered 8 packs online.:)</li>
            <li> Our family never has dry, cracked lips in the winter.</li>
            <li> Plus, main ingredient is caster oil, which I&#x27;ve found is the longest-lasting moisturizer, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Between heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, my lip get very dry.</li>
            <li> extremely well moisturizing your dry lips.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO smell or taste, which is preferred by me.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it seems to have a lower melting point than some of the more common chapsticks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but there&#x27;s nothing close.</li>
            <li> It works as well as any other chapstick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t replace it by other brands.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and it doesn&#x27;t form a skin or film of crust like other lip balms do.</li>
            <li> It is one of very few that is totally neutral, with no irritants like perfume or peppermint or colour.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find at the local stores</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is that I cannot find this product in any stores.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> No more dry, cracked, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It stays on, unlike other chapsticks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Also, it was not available on the Neutrogena website.</li>
            <li> Used Neutrogena lip balm for years and then it was not available for over a year.  </li>
            <li> However most lip balms have a waxy texture and awful after taste.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I was having to reapply all the time.</li>
            <li> Other chapsticks or lipsticks make my lips peel or feel worse.</li>
            <li> Now that I have 8 of them, I have one every time I need one - in my purse, in my car, in my office, next to my bedside, etc - now, I&#x27;m hardly ever without it!!!  </li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lip balms usually taste like coconut, or vanilla, or other random things.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some others, it&#x27;s not too thick, but also not too slimy.</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> , I looked around for a less expensive replacement.  </li>
            <li> The BAD:  -Low</li>
            <li> SO hard to find that!  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> My lips get chapped all year round!!!  </li>
            <li> Cold day or lots of sunshine - use it everyday.</li>
            <li> , I was unable to locate it in any of the stores who stock</li>
            <li> When a caster-oil &amp;#34;pot&amp;#34; lip moisturizer I was using got too expensive</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Too bad they discontinued the Aveeno version.</li>
            <li> Tasteless and creamy!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This chapstick is difficult to find in stores but there it was on Amazon!!  </li>
            <li> I bought about 6 kinds one day at Walgreen&#x27;s (not including Chap Sticks, which I hate)</li>
            <li> After two days of use, this product gave my lips an awful rash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst eye cream ever!!!</li>
            <li> nasty smell</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a whole case of this stuff as it is the only chapstick that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips.  It is one of very few that is totally neutral, with no irritants like perfume or peppermint or colour.  Of course, they discontinued it, as companies seem to do with all good products.  Change for the sake of change.  And who cares what their customers think.  I saw all kinds of comments in forums and reviews from people lamenting that they couldn&#x27;t find this wonderful product anymore.  I even contacted the company and they told me nobody had it any more, and, no, they wouldn&#x27;t reconsider their decision.  Fortunately I looked on Amazon and found it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Tasteless and creamy!</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena Formula Lip Moisturizer! I&#x27;m been using it for years. It&#x27;s the only lip product that works for me! I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but there&#x27;s nothing close. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I buy this Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer (SPF15) for everyone in my family; my kids, my grandkids and even my husband.  It has no color and no taste, which makes it perfect for everyone.  Also, it goes on very smoothly.  It has no waxy feel.  I use it under my lipstick.  I use it before I go to sleep.  My mother was in the ICU after her heart surgery and this was the perfect moisturizer for her extremely dry lips.  I&#x27;ve been trying different lip moisturizer for over 50 years and I have never found anything that even came close to this one.  Most drug stores do not carry this and when they do, it is hard to find because it gets pushed behind the larger Neutrogena products.  Neutrogena would do better to place this product near all the other lip aids.  Once people try this, they will be back.  Or they could just buy it in bulk from Amazon, like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside allot and have tried allot of different kinds of protection.  This product is a little on the expensive side, but it works great.  Like the old saying goes....you get what you pay for!!  And, this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I have tried so many different brands of lip balm and only been disappointed with the others.  My one and only complaint is that I cannot find this product in any stores.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent; I highly recommend it and have a  stick in almost every room for my convenience.  HOWEVER, I had ordered a \\&quot;pack of eight\\&quot; and after waiting three weeks and con-  tacting the seller twice I received only 7 of the eight ordered  sticks.  I contacted the seller regarding this and have neither  heard from them nor received the 8th stick.  This is just not  the standard of my experiences with Amazon.</li>
            <li> My lips chap very easily and I also get fever blisters from wind and sun exposure.  I have tried practically every lip protection product out there.  There is nothing better than Neutrogena.  I prefer the older variety, but they don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore.  The \\&quot;Norwegian Formula\\&quot; is the replacement.  Seems about as good so far, maybe a tiny bit waxier than the original but still better than most.  The sun and wind protection seem to be just as great.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t actually dry out my lips, but keeps them moisturized.  I order these in bulk as I like to keep one everywhere I might be.</li>
            <li> Best ever moisturizer and sun screen for your lips.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> As I get older I find that even though I live in a fairly humid climate my lips dry easily and even peel (yuck!). Lip balms that used to work only made matters work. I was dubious when I read reviews stating this product could relieve peeling lips overnight, but nothing locally available was working so why not try it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By golly, this product relieves peeling lips overnight! So I got several!</li>
            <li> After two days of use, this product gave my lips an awful rash.  I MEAN AWFULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL! HEAD AND TAKE WARNING TO WHAT I AM SAYING, PLEASE ...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this product and I must say I use all the time instead of my burts bees. Definitely one of the best I have used. I would recommend this to everyone except if your allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in NC, happy that I was able to find it online for a very good price.. .....Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only lip moisturizer I use. Feels good and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lip balm!  Have been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out lips. Protects against sun burn and has no odor or scent. It is the perfect lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> good lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found that this is the only stick that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on the lips.  it has a sunscreen in it that protects the lips from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this chapstick for many years, it is the only one I use. It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and not greasy. It stays on, unlike other chapsticks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Just right for the harsh dry  winter of 2015.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!  this is the only lip balm my daughter will use!  Does not burn, even on very chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Only lip moisturizer I will use.  Glad to know that I can get it from you, since all of the stores around me have discontinued it!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to crumble and fall apart as I apply it to my lips. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the wheel to push the product up is at the top rather than at the bottom as it is on most lip moisturizers. I keep accidentally turning the wheel as I take the top off.</li>
            <li> I always keep plenty on hand so I don&#x27;t worry about running out. Love this kind, not waxy or greasy...just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve ever found that actually has no smell or flavor whatsoever.  Even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lip balms usually taste like coconut, or vanilla, or other random things.  It&#x27;s very annoying.  This one has no scent, it is wonderful.  It works as well as any other chapstick.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena lip moisturizer for eight years and it is just a wonderful product. It does not leave your lips gummy or waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip moisturizer that I use.  It is the best!</li>
            <li> I;m very satisfied with this product, I was unable to locate it in any of the stores who stock&lt;br /&gt;this product. Also, it was not available on the Neutrogena website.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Only lip balm I will use.</li>
            <li> I had really chapped lips (to the point it would bleed at times) and Neutorgena lip moisturizer did it&#x27;s magic in one day!</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick ever!! It is very smooth but non-greasy. You will not be disappointed.  It is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best Lip Moisturizer I have ever used. It gives great protection in all seasons. The texture is fantastic and it goes on smoothly thoroughly coating your lips.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and all of a sudden, my local store doesn&#x27;t have it, plus every store I looked at didn&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> I consider myself something of a lip balm connoisseur, and this has become the only one I like.  Most lip balms that have sunscreen in them have a funny after taste, even if you are careful not to get any on your inner lips or teeth.  This one has no off-putting taste.  It is smooth and long-lasting.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This Lip moisturizer is the only type that helps my very sore lips due to a medical treatment.  I tried to get it from Neutrogena but they said that they could not help me because it was out of stock.  Thank you Amazon for coming through for me.</li>
            <li> Really. It&#x27;s the best lip balm - period. No need to say much else. Get it!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever. Hands down.</li>
            <li> Neutragena lip moisturizer is a great product. I have been using for five years. We have used various other moisturizers, none of them work like this. Me &amp; my wife love this product. we have couple at home, car and carry with us in my pocket or her handbag. it is cheaper to buy as bulk purchase in Amazon. Shipping arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really works onin my lips.</li>
            <li> This product is a superior product to any sold for lip moisturizing. As a sportsman, it is always nice to have this product with me to keep my lips moist during a round of golf or watching a sporting event.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip moisturizers in the past and this is the only one that seems to keep my lips from chafing and&lt;br /&gt;drying out.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my daughter by her flute teacher as working the best. So far not only is it working well for her, but my son, who plays trumpet, no longer goes through a tube a week since he started using this product. Granted, he overuses lip balm in general, but it has worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I work out in the sun, camp and spend most of my time in the sun and this is the best sunscreen for lips.  Not waxy.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else on my lips or my families.</li>
            <li> This is the worst eye cream ever!!!</li>
            <li> The only kind of lip moisturizer I buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it. My lips can&#x27;t handle anything but this and aquafore. Other chapsticks or lipsticks make my lips peel or feel worse. Love this also because it has sunscreen. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was using the cheaper flavored lip balms but I was getting a rash around my mouth. I tried these and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like them because they&#x27;re not flavored, but I really like them. It&#x27;s just a very neutral no-taste kind of thing and it does last a good amount of time. The rash has gone away and I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Very good lip blam and reasonable price. Have been using it for 15 years. Can&#x27;t replace it by other brands.</li>
            <li> This works the best. I used to be able to buy it locally but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years. So glad that I was able to order it on amazon!</li>
            <li> our favorite lip balm but a bit hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Cold day or lots of sunshine - use it everyday. Keeps the lips soft. Never use anything else. Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but postage too expensive</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Whenever I have cracked lips, I just leave it on overnight and my lips are perfectly moisturized the next morning. It&#x27;s not overly greasy, and not so watery that it doesn&#x27;t stay on. It&#x27;s actually the perfect balance for my preference.</li>
            <li> Between heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, my lip get very dry. I use body lotion and face moisturizer, so I thought, &amp;#34;why not my lips?&amp;#34; I have tried others but Neutrogena seems to work best for me. And the SPF is good protection as I am in the sun  a lot.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Aveeno version of this lip balm but close.  Too bad they discontinued the Aveeno version.</li>
            <li> I got this free with a sunscreen. It has spf 15 without the smell or taste of sunscreen! Makes my lips appear just balmy, no added color or such. Doesn&#x27;t make them white. VERY moisturizing and long wearing. Must buy!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip balm!</li>
            <li> The best lip moisturizer I have ever used.  I have not.been able to get it locally and was glad to see I could order it on line.</li>
            <li> THis product work best for me. I have used it for many years. I cannot find it in local stores&lt;br /&gt;A satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very smooth and moisturizing.  The screw mechanism is on the product end (not the bottom) and doesn&#x27;t tend to work itself forward when in my pocket like most other lip balm containers.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with others. This product outlast the competition.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend  this product to everyone. This product is a must have</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand chap stick like products, too waxy.  I love this lip balm but it is so hard to find.  My last retail spot quit selling it so I went to the internet and found it and even at a better price.  I get 12 packs at a time.  I don&#x27;t know why stores don&#x27;t carry this wonderful lip balm.  If you don&#x27;t like waxy, this is the lip balm for you.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer for more than 20 years.  Please keep it the way it is.  It is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a 10! try it you&#x27;ll like it. Neutrogena is consistently a good buy and good product. I would recommend this lip moisturizer..</li>
            <li> Have been looking for Neutrogena for quite a while. finally found it  Thank You</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is great.  Feels good on my dry lips.</li>
            <li> this is the best lip balm everrrr - and hard to find in grocery and/or drug stores.  I&#x27;ve found ordering online through Amazon.com to be the best way to purchase ... no running all over trying to find a store that carries it and the price is comparable to stores IF they carried it!</li>
            <li> Used Neutrogena lip balm for years and then it was not available for over a year.  When I found this I was delighted.  It is a great product.  Still have not seen it locally.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The GOOD:  -No nasty smell/taste  -Coverage lasts a long time  -Excellent sun protection  -SUPER moisturizing    The BAD:  -Low melting point    Let me start by saying, this is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down. No questions asked. This stuff rocks!    It applies very easily and smoothly. Unlike some others, it&#x27;s not too thick, but also not too slimy. There is absolutely NO smell or taste, which is preferred by me. I used to apply chapstick about every 45 minutes, but this stuff keeps me covered for hours. It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks. No more dry, cracked, chapped lips. The only bad thing is it seems to have a lower melting point than some of the more common chapsticks. It&#x27;s never completely liquified on me, but if I leave it in the sun, or take it with me on a run it starts to get kinda squishy.     Recommended: Absolutely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flavor-free, has SPF 15, and it has the the perfect smooth texture.  It&#x27;s still the best after all these years.</li>
            <li> Best lip gloss around..no wax and dermatologist recommended.  Big box drug stores are no longer carrying...they seem to think we go to drugstores for food!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite lip balm.  Works extremely well moisturizing your dry lips.  Also has sun block in the formula doe added protection. Very hard to find in the stores.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I cannot find locally.  It is the only lip moisturizer that I can use so I am delighted when I can find it through Amazon.  Shipped promptly.  Great transaction!</li>
            <li> I have used this lip moisturizer for years.  I have also tried many others... always come back to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a reasonable price when you buy bulk!!  savings are big when added up.  I go through a lot of these tubs so this is they way to BUY!</li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and the product is great. Thanks</li>
            <li> great lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tried almost all lip balms...but none of them worked for me...finally i found my product !!! This is an excellent product, very good spf... makes lips very soft... i strongly recommend this.. sad part is that this is not available in stores, so i ordered 8 packs online.:)</li>
            <li> Our family of five really likes this chapstick. We&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s not too waxy. We keep it everywhere for when we need it (the car, the kitchen, at work, at school, etc). Happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> very good - stays on fairly well - I do have to re-apply every so often, but no complaints</li>
            <li> I used to have a Chapstick addiction.  I was constantly applying and reapplying it.  Often, it went on &amp;#34;chunky,&amp;#34; and I was picking at it trying to regain a natural look.  Neutrogena&#x27;s lip balm goes on consistently smoothly.</li>
            <li> This marvelous stuff is no longer being produced, so now I want to hoard it.  Best lip balm ever.&lt;br /&gt;super moisturizing.  unnoticeable. tastes of nothing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Recommended by a couple of dermatologist throughout the years. Sometimes hard to find at the local stores so I ordered off Amazon. Like to have my own stock on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the one that I keep digging out of my purse.  No flavor or scent whatsoever.  SO hard to find that!  Plus, main ingredient is caster oil, which I&#x27;ve found is the longest-lasting moisturizer, at least for me.  When a caster-oil &amp;#34;pot&amp;#34; lip moisturizer I was using got too expensive, I looked around for a less expensive replacement.  I bought about 6 kinds one day at Walgreen&#x27;s (not including Chap Sticks, which I hate) and this is the one that came out on top, by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled most of my life with sensitive skin, and other lip balm type products like Chapstick, Blistex, and even Burt&#x27;s Bees can cause my lips to get irritated and itchy. This Neutrogena Norwegian Formula lip moisturizer is the only one I&#x27;ve found to not cause irritation. It&#x27;s odorless and provides the right amount of moisture so that I can go about my day. I will continue to buy this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> The best lip moisturizer, period!</li>
            <li> best price around for a great product!</li>
            <li> This chapstick is difficult to find in stores but there it was on Amazon!!  It came in a pack of 8 and all of them were out of the original packages (I&#x27;m thinking for more convenient shipping) but all were brand new.  I am the happiest person getting this 8 pack of Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer!  Ok...the best thing about this chapstick is that it doesn&#x27;t have a flavor or taste...AT ALL!  I can put it on and have a drink or eat something and my food or drink doesn&#x27;t taste like whatever I put on my lips!!!  It also lasts a good amount of time on my lips, keeps my lips soft and it doesn&#x27;t dehydrate them if I happen not to wear it for a day.  But I have to say I don&#x27;t wear it only when I forget to bring it with me;-)  Now that I have 8 of them, I have one every time I need one - in my purse, in my car, in my office, next to my bedside, etc - now, I&#x27;m hardly ever without it!!!  So glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best lip balm out there.  I have tried almost every lip balm out there and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> i love this lip balm. i already finished one tube and i already ordered a new one. there isn&#x27;t a flavor, smell, or color but it&#x27;s fantastic. within two days of using it i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my lower lip that&#x27;s hoe good it is and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and it doesn&#x27;t form a skin or film of crust like other lip balms do. i love how the roller is at the top too!</li>
            <li> Always a great item and fast shipping. This is my second order of this item and I order 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li> This product used to be readily available in stores everywhere.  For some reason you can no longer find it as easily as you used to be able to.  This is a great product!!!  Not too greasy, but heals chapped lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever had.  I like to have a stick in my jacket, briefcase, in the car, etc so that I have it when I need it.</li>
            <li> I search for this every store I go into and rarely find it anymore.  I don&#x27;t know why since it is without a doubt the best lip moisturizer ever!  Feels like your natural lips in really great condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the lip balms with SPF as I live in florida and lubricating and protecting my lips are of&lt;br /&gt;paramount importance.  However most lip balms have a waxy texture and awful after taste.  Not Neutrogena --it is silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;and protects lips even while riding on boats.  My husband is now hooked on them as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;I never leave home without it.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried a multitude of products and nothing works better than this</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, great price!</li>
            <li> . Love this Chapstick unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. This Chapstick moisturizers well and doesn&#x27;t leave a built up residue like other chapsticks with multiple use. No taste, smell or color perfect for under lipstick or by itself.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for many, many years. It is perfect, not too waxy. We have 5 family members and everyone carries one on them. Plus, we keep one in each bathroom, car, and the kitchen. Our family never has dry, cracked lips in the winter. Plus, it protects our lips from sunburn in the summer.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm on the market. It is not waxy, goes on evenly and smoothly, and moisturizes my lips.</li>
            <li> I went to this product because my other lip moisturizer was causing an allergic reaction and was causing great pain. I needed to fine something that worked without effecting me. This moisturizer is the first one that I have ever used that stayed on long and I did not have to keep putting it on. In the past, I was having to reapply all the time. Thanks to Neutrogena I an a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> My lips get chapped all year round!!!  Yes, I&#x27;m hydrated(0:  neutrogena lip moisturizer is the best at keeping my lips moist without any yucky taste. It&#x27;s the only one I use!!</li>
            <li> Best lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  A must have for all seasons.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of buying crappy lip ointments, this is my long-term choice.  I buy it by the case.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love neutrongena lip.</li>
            <li> We have used this lip balm for a few years and really like it. Hard to find in stores like so many great products. Thank you Amazon for carrying older hard to find products.</li>
            <li> Since I work outdoors I always have one of these in my pocket. My wife also carries one with her at all times. I save money by buying them in bulk. Very good product and should be since it is Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and always have chapped lips.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lip balms.  I&#x27;ve been buying this product for the last couple years.  My wife now uses this as well.  There is no obnoxious flavor and it doesn&#x27;t go on like wax (chap stix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still #1 choice 2016</li>
            <li> Continues to be one of the best.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have always been one to put lipstick or chapstick on my lips constantly.  This is the first chapstick that I have found that keeps my lips moisturized.  I can&#x27;t find it in a store, so I order the 8 pack from Amazon.  This is the only product I will use for my lips!!!</li>
            <li> The best lip chap I have ever used, they stopped selling it in Canada, so at least I can get it on Amazon! It is well priced and exactly what I expected, but doesn&#x27;t come in packaging.</li>
            <li> My favorite for over ten years!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it came fast with a good price. I highly recommend this lip moisturizer and this seller.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 20 year!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Been using this for many years. Amazon shops faster and better than anyone</li>
            <li> Recommended by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist.  Love the product.  Offers wonderful moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> The only lip moisturizer that was comparable was the other Neutrogena one that was discontinued years ago.  This is awesome - not waxy but smooth and really keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li> These became my favorite lip moisturizers to use while living in France.  I came back to the States and purchased a bunch of these thinking they&#x27;re the same thing.  Nope.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine for most but I was expecting the identical product as the one I was using overseas.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is GREAT.  It does not have any flavor and it makes my lips so soft and prevents them from cracking.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
