    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so I&#x27;m the perfect candidate for this machine.</li>
            <li>It worked AWESOME.</li>
            <li>The Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Face &amp; Body permanent hair removal system is excellent!!</li>
            <li>My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn.</li>
            <li>but if you are patient you should see great results.</li>
            <li>my legs - it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>So, once again, I am happy.</li>
            <li>Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.    </li>
            <li>You need a lot of a patience to use this, and I would be happy to sell mine to anyone who asks, as mine is sparingly used.</li>
            <li>It works great and will do all the jobs I need done from head to toe.</li>
            <li>I love this instrument!!</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this product a fair try before reviewing.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good candidate, with fair skin and brown hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product 2 times according to the instructions and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Results are great tho, just follow the instructions, enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper :)</li>
            <li>Now, I understand the owners believe you need to sustain tolerance before having a ten-hour marathon hair removal session in your apartment, but there is something to be said for newer products offering that kind of unlimited service without wait times.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy hand held device.</li>
            <li>It seemed great a first</li>
            <li>so i could give an accurate review!</li>
            <li>It is interesting reading, but the page you should go to is 116 (handwritten at the bottom of the page).  </li>
            <li>Sure is taking a lot of treatments to show any results....</li>
            <li>I will use it again in two weeks and see if it works better.</li>
            <li>and I can go more days between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more proof I needed than that one hair disappearing for good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>Knowing what I know, laser would have been the better option for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure by then, the hair will be gone and I won&#x27;t have to worry about shaving/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make sure to watch the video that comes with it - as it explains how to use the device.  </li>
            <li>And they send us a cartrigde with 5000 pulses :)</li>
            <li>i love it ,,can wait to start</li>
            <li>Now my legs are practically hair free!  </li>
            <li>Each time I used the device I probably pulled the trigger 20 times at most.  </li>
            <li>I recommend and love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe i found such a great product that works! :)</li>
            <li>many Sellers would do that for a customer, but this one did</li>
            <li>I am very excited about reviewing this product, i waited 3 months</li>
            <li>I have had great results so far!</li>
            <li>It has been great so far!</li>
            <li>So far it is working great.  </li>
            <li>For something developed to be used at home it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast ,good heldful</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to see</li>
            <li>Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally I contacted the Seller and explained my circumstances and the Seller was more than happy to help me.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, can use the highest setting without discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li>it appears to work fine</li>
            <li>but I cannot say for certain it has lessened to the degree I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>As for my arms, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well with light colored hair</li>
            <li>It was packaged securely as well.  </li>
            <li>This product works yet it is cheaply constructed and the company provides no customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just want you to know that you are dealing with a fantastic Seller.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I no longer have to shave so much and the hair i do have grows so much slower.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on me because I was on the border of the color scale that it might and might not work..  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write this kind of comments</li>
            <li>so I could see exactly what would grow back, but I am happy to report that I have huge patches where hair no longer comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I kicked up the power to full by the fifth or sixth session</li>
            <li>; If you can&#x27;t afford $5000 to get rid of unwanted hair, consider finding an electrology student or an esthetician student at a nearby beauty academy to do it for you under a powerful light.  </li>
            <li>The Seller graciously accepted my return and issued a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought several of the light cartridges and the unit stopped working before I was able to use them!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, some brown marks appeared on side of face and I backed off, but the rest of my face was fine..</li>
            <li>I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read many online reviews here on amazon and elsewhere before I finally decided to get it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number.</li>
            <li>My lower legs have had the best results so far they also had much thinner and lighter hairs than the bikini and armpit areas, they are the only reason I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>The expenditure was worth the time and energy</li>
            <li>Cartridges must be replaced and will be an ongoing expense but worth it.</li>
            <li>It is just not as powerful as the one at the salons</li>
            <li>I am just surprised that it has to be repeated so many times.  </li>
            <li>This product is great so far, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li>First you have to use use it on full three stars laser.</li>
            <li>At full pulse it works amazingly took only two times to start really showing results.</li>
            <li>I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4.</li>
            <li>First of all i am fair skin with dark hairs.</li>
            <li>Product is as described and the instructions were clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I received my order very fast.  </li>
            <li>Not so great when I&#x27;m in the middle of a treatment and have to wait several hours or a day to continue and by then I can&#x27;t remember exactly where I left off.&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure to do a test area and wait a day to see how your skin handles the &amp;#34;zap&amp;#34</li>
            <li>gave this a 4 because it is a long process, however, the device is very, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This document is most likely the FDA approval referenced in the product&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li>If you fall into one of those risk categories that are listed you will be told either that you can&#x27;t use the product, or that you may be able to use it if you can have treatment to resolve the medical risk.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in the product and found the FDA documents as part of my research and felt compelled to share this with you.  </li>
            <li>My bikini line has had some patchy bald spots appear after 3 uses the first 2</li>
            <li>so I wont have to worry about how many flashes are left.</li>
            <li>If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room.</li>
            <li>My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for either IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li>I noticed reduced hair growth with the first treatment on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>I know, now from going to a professional laser hair removal place for a free consultation, that you should not be on any medicines that are not conducive to sunlight.  .</li>
            <li>had to try, it have used it, only for my face, I want to make sure I have it for my face when I need it.  </li>
            <li>, glad I ordered it when i did - giving myself several months to use before my trip to Cancun!</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted this to remove facial hair, when i received this product</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If anyone in Baltimore is interested to have this then let me know.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so pleased initially</li>
            <li>It is working exactly as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li>You thus need to spend maybe 4-5 hours per week doing your body and trying to see small hairs without the benefit of amazing lighting and super vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ordered the package that came with 3 cartridges and one cartridge covered about one full treatment and a half on my legs, arms, underarms and most of my bikini area</li>
            <li>is pretty much gone both under arms and on legs</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li>I was so happy, but then the refills barely made it through 2 sessions which was weird and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the machine but focusing more on my legs now</li>
            <li>The hair grows so much slower that I can go a day or two without shaving before it becomes noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>
            <li>This product seemed so promising when I unwrapped it Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li>As much as I like to think of myself as perfectly capable of giving myself beautification treatments at home, there is something to be said for exploring the possibility of paying an expert $5000 over the course of a few months to get everything taken care of nicely.  </li>
            <li>but the hair was much thinner and not as noticeable as my legs, so who knows.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting instant removal or no growth, so I am pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li>Very minimal irritation, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt :)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is amazing saw results after four treatment s.looking forward to no more hair.would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of razors.tried the mono but never saw results.thanks for bringing this into our homes and its so much cheaper than any salon.</li>
            <li>About 50% of the hair has stopped growing (no where near the websites 75% estimation), the patchy bald spots appeared after the first use and they seem permanent.</li>
            <li>I think it would have been preferable to have 4 cartridges that worked at full capacity than a 1000 extra flashes that may or may not work because the cartridge is wearing down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The peach fuzz on my stomach is pretty much completely gone.</li>
            <li>If I can handle the pain, why should I have to wait an entire day to get only 15 more minutes of zapping time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried about burning my skin since I have VERY sensitive skin, but no burning at all!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting eye were to protect your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I saw instant results in that my hair grew slower and thinner after the first use!  </li>
            <li>Much less pain than the laser center, and it&#x27;s quick and easy!</li>
            <li>product may be great - I just don&#x27;t know since we received wrong product.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t really noticing any change but after the third session</li>
            <li>I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>(Anecdotally, I now have a personal esthetician who gives me facials in the comfort of my own apartment, a personal hairdresser who cuts and styles my hair whenever I want something done for an event, and a personal stylist to take care of my shopping.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few times, but each time more hair is gone forever.</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>Also i noticed that the 1st cartridge lasted me ages, I was able to do my legs, arms, underarms, and small midriff area about 6 times before it died&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the second treatment I noticed a big difference on my legs and underarms and even more of a difference after the 3rd treatment.</li>
            <li>then all the skin came off and those places are white like paper... probably funny, but my both legs look like</li>
            <li>wife was just not interested in this device and that was the only problem we had, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>It has taken more cartridges than I anticipated, but after 1 yr, very few hairs have appeared.  </li>
            <li>It kinda slows down the hair growth but no matter how many times you use it, the hair will eventually come back.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I have a little redness that goes away in a couple hours if I zap the same spot more than once.</li>
            <li>it did not hurt me at all and the instructions are fairly clear.</li>
            <li>And steer clear of your tattoos if you have any, think laser tattoo removal if you accidentally zap over one.</li>
            <li>My hair is not gone completely yet</li>
            <li>doc took me off my hormones and the hair on my upper lip was really bothering me.</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase this item and after two treatments that hair is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>or so I noticed my hair growing back very patchy.</li>
            <li>I used the product for the second time and my skin burnt so much and the marks are still there.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li>I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li>However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>
            <li>I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li>But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>
            <li>I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.    </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li>But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>
            <li>and/or growing back much slower.  </li>
            <li>I have used it under my armpits, this is where the hair is still growing back, but much slower.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this product to a professional hair removal, because I haven&#x27;t had that done.</li>
            <li>Am surprised by the results so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin/</li>
            <li>Later I found it very tolerable and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now</li>
            <li>but she really was not into using it for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m very upset that it was advertised to come with three cartridges and only had one.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely sparse and requires only rare shaving.  </li>
            <li>(so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money and buy it if you are too tanned or have blonde hair because the laser needs the contrast of light skin to dark</li>
            <li>The results are pretty mixed: my under arms are practically the same as before treatment, though the hair follicles do grow slower and thinner than before all of the hair is still growing under them.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li>(light skin and dark hair only).  </li>
            <li>I estimate that about 25% of the hair has actually stopped growing on my bikini line but that is a high estimation.</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t think this is strong enough to be truly effective on my bikini line or armpits, I find I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li>the bikini area I am having a little harder time with hopefully with a couple more treatments I will have same results.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to a light snapping, you can buy some numbing lotion, I like Greencaine for painful treatments like chemical peels and so forth, but found it very helpful the first time i did this</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the product once and tried to follow the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the six treatments over three months as instructed all on the highest setting, it barely tingles.</li>
            <li>, one year later I have patches of hair that have completely stopped growing on my arms, bikini area and legs.</li>
            <li>and I barely see hair.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve treated my lower legs 3x and upper legs twice.  </li>
            <li>If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li>If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li>was very diligent and used this machine every other week on the area mentioned above for about 3 months which works out to 6 sessions.</li>
            <li>It is an ongoing process as hair follicles have a 7 year cycle and some may not have been growing during the first treatment round.  </li>
            <li>The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it.</li>
            <li>The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it.</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll be until you&#x27;re hair free until at least a year has gone by.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used it on high since (I have extremely sensitive, pale skin</li>
            <li>I had hoped this would work :/ Have been using several months with only minimal effect on some of the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>My mustache grows back so much slower and patchier making it a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The company offers no decent instructional manuals or videos to maximize the product effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so I&#x27;m the perfect candidate for this machine.</li>
            <li> It worked AWESOME.</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Face &amp; Body permanent hair removal system is excellent!!</li>
            <li> My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn.</li>
            <li> but if you are patient you should see great results.</li>
            <li> my legs - it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li> So, once again, I am happy.</li>
            <li> Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.    </li>
            <li> You need a lot of a patience to use this, and I would be happy to sell mine to anyone who asks, as mine is sparingly used.</li>
            <li> It works great and will do all the jobs I need done from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I love this instrument!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a fair try before reviewing.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good candidate, with fair skin and brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product 2 times according to the instructions and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Results are great tho, just follow the instructions, enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy camper :)</li>
            <li> Now, I understand the owners believe you need to sustain tolerance before having a ten-hour marathon hair removal session in your apartment, but there is something to be said for newer products offering that kind of unlimited service without wait times.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy hand held device.</li>
            <li> It seemed great a first</li>
            <li> so i could give an accurate review!</li>
            <li> It is interesting reading, but the page you should go to is 116 (handwritten at the bottom of the page).  </li>
            <li> Sure is taking a lot of treatments to show any results....</li>
            <li> I will use it again in two weeks and see if it works better.</li>
            <li> and I can go more days between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what more proof I needed than that one hair disappearing for good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet.</li>
            <li> That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li> That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li> Knowing what I know, laser would have been the better option for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure by then, the hair will be gone and I won&#x27;t have to worry about shaving/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Make sure to watch the video that comes with it - as it explains how to use the device.  </li>
            <li> And they send us a cartrigde with 5000 pulses :)</li>
            <li> i love it ,,can wait to start</li>
            <li> Now my legs are practically hair free!  </li>
            <li> Each time I used the device I probably pulled the trigger 20 times at most.  </li>
            <li> I recommend and love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i found such a great product that works! :)</li>
            <li> many Sellers would do that for a customer, but this one did</li>
            <li> I am very excited about reviewing this product, i waited 3 months</li>
            <li> I have had great results so far!</li>
            <li> It has been great so far!</li>
            <li> So far it is working great.  </li>
            <li> For something developed to be used at home it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast ,good heldful</li>
            <li> and it was so easy to see</li>
            <li> Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally I contacted the Seller and explained my circumstances and the Seller was more than happy to help me.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, can use the highest setting without discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li> it appears to work fine</li>
            <li> but I cannot say for certain it has lessened to the degree I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> As for my arms, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with light colored hair</li>
            <li> It was packaged securely as well.  </li>
            <li> This product works yet it is cheaply constructed and the company provides no customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just want you to know that you are dealing with a fantastic Seller.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> and I am so happy I no longer have to shave so much and the hair i do have grows so much slower.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on me because I was on the border of the color scale that it might and might not work..  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write this kind of comments</li>
            <li> so I could see exactly what would grow back, but I am happy to report that I have huge patches where hair no longer comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I kicked up the power to full by the fifth or sixth session</li>
            <li> ; If you can&#x27;t afford $5000 to get rid of unwanted hair, consider finding an electrology student or an esthetician student at a nearby beauty academy to do it for you under a powerful light.  </li>
            <li> The Seller graciously accepted my return and issued a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought several of the light cartridges and the unit stopped working before I was able to use them!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, some brown marks appeared on side of face and I backed off, but the rest of my face was fine..</li>
            <li> I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges.</li>
            <li> Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many online reviews here on amazon and elsewhere before I finally decided to get it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number.</li>
            <li> My lower legs have had the best results so far they also had much thinner and lighter hairs than the bikini and armpit areas, they are the only reason I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> The expenditure was worth the time and energy</li>
            <li> Cartridges must be replaced and will be an ongoing expense but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is just not as powerful as the one at the salons</li>
            <li> I am just surprised that it has to be repeated so many times.  </li>
            <li> This product is great so far, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li> First you have to use use it on full three stars laser.</li>
            <li> At full pulse it works amazingly took only two times to start really showing results.</li>
            <li> I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4.</li>
            <li> First of all i am fair skin with dark hairs.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and the instructions were clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I received my order very fast.  </li>
            <li> Not so great when I&#x27;m in the middle of a treatment and have to wait several hours or a day to continue and by then I can&#x27;t remember exactly where I left off.&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure to do a test area and wait a day to see how your skin handles the &amp;#34;zap&amp;#34</li>
            <li> gave this a 4 because it is a long process, however, the device is very, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This document is most likely the FDA approval referenced in the product&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li> If you fall into one of those risk categories that are listed you will be told either that you can&#x27;t use the product, or that you may be able to use it if you can have treatment to resolve the medical risk.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in the product and found the FDA documents as part of my research and felt compelled to share this with you.  </li>
            <li> My bikini line has had some patchy bald spots appear after 3 uses the first 2</li>
            <li> so I wont have to worry about how many flashes are left.</li>
            <li> If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room.</li>
            <li> My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for either IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li> I noticed reduced hair growth with the first treatment on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> I know, now from going to a professional laser hair removal place for a free consultation, that you should not be on any medicines that are not conducive to sunlight.  .</li>
            <li> had to try, it have used it, only for my face, I want to make sure I have it for my face when I need it.  </li>
            <li> , glad I ordered it when i did - giving myself several months to use before my trip to Cancun!</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted this to remove facial hair, when i received this product</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If anyone in Baltimore is interested to have this then let me know.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so pleased initially</li>
            <li> It is working exactly as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li> You thus need to spend maybe 4-5 hours per week doing your body and trying to see small hairs without the benefit of amazing lighting and super vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ordered the package that came with 3 cartridges and one cartridge covered about one full treatment and a half on my legs, arms, underarms and most of my bikini area</li>
            <li> is pretty much gone both under arms and on legs</li>
            <li> I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li> I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li> I was so happy, but then the refills barely made it through 2 sessions which was weird and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the machine but focusing more on my legs now</li>
            <li> The hair grows so much slower that I can go a day or two without shaving before it becomes noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>
            <li> This product seemed so promising when I unwrapped it Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li> As much as I like to think of myself as perfectly capable of giving myself beautification treatments at home, there is something to be said for exploring the possibility of paying an expert $5000 over the course of a few months to get everything taken care of nicely.  </li>
            <li> but the hair was much thinner and not as noticeable as my legs, so who knows.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting instant removal or no growth, so I am pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> Very minimal irritation, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt :)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is amazing saw results after four treatment s.looking forward to no more hair.would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of razors.tried the mono but never saw results.thanks for bringing this into our homes and its so much cheaper than any salon.</li>
            <li> About 50% of the hair has stopped growing (no where near the websites 75% estimation), the patchy bald spots appeared after the first use and they seem permanent.</li>
            <li> I think it would have been preferable to have 4 cartridges that worked at full capacity than a 1000 extra flashes that may or may not work because the cartridge is wearing down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The peach fuzz on my stomach is pretty much completely gone.</li>
            <li> If I can handle the pain, why should I have to wait an entire day to get only 15 more minutes of zapping time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried about burning my skin since I have VERY sensitive skin, but no burning at all!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting eye were to protect your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I saw instant results in that my hair grew slower and thinner after the first use!  </li>
            <li> Much less pain than the laser center, and it&#x27;s quick and easy!</li>
            <li> product may be great - I just don&#x27;t know since we received wrong product.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really noticing any change but after the third session</li>
            <li> I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li> not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li> (Anecdotally, I now have a personal esthetician who gives me facials in the comfort of my own apartment, a personal hairdresser who cuts and styles my hair whenever I want something done for an event, and a personal stylist to take care of my shopping.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times, but each time more hair is gone forever.</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> Also i noticed that the 1st cartridge lasted me ages, I was able to do my legs, arms, underarms, and small midriff area about 6 times before it died&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the second treatment I noticed a big difference on my legs and underarms and even more of a difference after the 3rd treatment.</li>
            <li> then all the skin came off and those places are white like paper... probably funny, but my both legs look like</li>
            <li> wife was just not interested in this device and that was the only problem we had, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> It has taken more cartridges than I anticipated, but after 1 yr, very few hairs have appeared.  </li>
            <li> It kinda slows down the hair growth but no matter how many times you use it, the hair will eventually come back.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have a little redness that goes away in a couple hours if I zap the same spot more than once.</li>
            <li> it did not hurt me at all and the instructions are fairly clear.</li>
            <li> And steer clear of your tattoos if you have any, think laser tattoo removal if you accidentally zap over one.</li>
            <li> My hair is not gone completely yet</li>
            <li> doc took me off my hormones and the hair on my upper lip was really bothering me.</li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase this item and after two treatments that hair is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> or so I noticed my hair growing back very patchy.</li>
            <li> I used the product for the second time and my skin burnt so much and the marks are still there.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li> I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li> However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>
            <li> I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li> But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>
            <li> I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.    </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li> But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>
            <li> and/or growing back much slower.  </li>
            <li> I have used it under my armpits, this is where the hair is still growing back, but much slower.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this product to a professional hair removal, because I haven&#x27;t had that done.</li>
            <li> Am surprised by the results so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin/</li>
            <li> Later I found it very tolerable and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now</li>
            <li> but she really was not into using it for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m very upset that it was advertised to come with three cartridges and only had one.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely sparse and requires only rare shaving.  </li>
            <li> (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money and buy it if you are too tanned or have blonde hair because the laser needs the contrast of light skin to dark</li>
            <li> The results are pretty mixed: my under arms are practically the same as before treatment, though the hair follicles do grow slower and thinner than before all of the hair is still growing under them.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li> (light skin and dark hair only).  </li>
            <li> I estimate that about 25% of the hair has actually stopped growing on my bikini line but that is a high estimation.</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t think this is strong enough to be truly effective on my bikini line or armpits, I find I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> the bikini area I am having a little harder time with hopefully with a couple more treatments I will have same results.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to a light snapping, you can buy some numbing lotion, I like Greencaine for painful treatments like chemical peels and so forth, but found it very helpful the first time i did this</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the product once and tried to follow the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the six treatments over three months as instructed all on the highest setting, it barely tingles.</li>
            <li> , one year later I have patches of hair that have completely stopped growing on my arms, bikini area and legs.</li>
            <li> and I barely see hair.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve treated my lower legs 3x and upper legs twice.  </li>
            <li> If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li> If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li> was very diligent and used this machine every other week on the area mentioned above for about 3 months which works out to 6 sessions.</li>
            <li> It is an ongoing process as hair follicles have a 7 year cycle and some may not have been growing during the first treatment round.  </li>
            <li> The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it.</li>
            <li> The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll be until you&#x27;re hair free until at least a year has gone by.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t used it on high since (I have extremely sensitive, pale skin</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would work :/ Have been using several months with only minimal effect on some of the fine hairs.</li>

            <li> My hair is SUPER dark, thick and coarse, especially around the bikini area which is why that area is the hardest to get rid of, but there has been a difference, the patches on my bikini area do not grow back, it is permanently gone.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

            <li> I woke up bright and early and decided to take care of body hair once and for all in a way that preserves my modesty, without paying $60/hour for an electrologist, messy waxes, and painful shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get.</li>

            <li> I think the minor irritation is because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough between treatments.  </li>

            <li> Several other products exist that rival this one, and I suggest you look into them as the pricetag and &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; of this product are unjustifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nobody tells you that there are three different stages of hair growth and that you need to be extremely patient when using these types of at-home electrolysis products.  </li>
            <li> After looking online I found out that the product will only run for so long and as a safety feature it shuts off and wont turn back on (for how long, I&#x27;m not sure).</li>
            <li> am sure this machine works because I also had this 1 annoying thick hair growing right under my bellybutton</li>

            <li> I noticed about 1/3 reduction in regrowth (a few bald spots).</li>
            <li> I will let you know in a few months.</li>
            <li> but now I am stuck with a useless device that can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li> However it is something you get use to, and it doesn&#x27;t bother you after you do it a few times.</li>

            <li> did very little</li>

            <li> This is the area it works the least for me.</li>
            <li> I was also unhappy after the third use because the device was registering errors after I just turned it on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Please search on Google for FDA UCM303242.pdf.  This document is most likely the FDA approval referenced in the product&#x27;s description.  It is  a lengthy download containing all documents between the FDA and the Israeli company that requested approval in 2008 to sell the product in the USA. It is interesting reading, but the page you should go to is 116 (handwritten at the bottom of the page).  This is where the Contraindications Section begins.  If you fall into one of those risk categories that are listed you will be told either that you can&#x27;t use the product, or that you may be able to use it if you can have treatment to resolve the medical risk.  I am unable to use the product, and am disappointed.  However the health consequences outweigh the disappointment.  I hope that you will take the precaution of reading the Contraindications before you make a purchase decision.  By the way, I am not associated with a competitor or have any ax to grind.  I was interested in the product and found the FDA documents as part of my research and felt compelled to share this with you.  The 1 star rating does not reflect my use of the product; rather it reflects my concern that someone at risk may buy and use this product to their detriment.</li>
            <li> Sure is taking a lot of treatments to show any results....maybe not strong enough :(</li>
            <li> I got this product about 3 months ago but didn&#x27;t want to review it until I could see some results.  So far it is working great.  It took a while but I could definitely see results.  My hair is not gone completely yet but it is definitely sparse and requires only rare shaving.  With time I think the hair will be gone.  You won&#x27;t see immediate results but if you are patient you should see great results.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the product once and tried to follow the instructions to the letter. I saw no results at all. I will use it again in two weeks and see if it works better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a fair try before reviewing.  I&#x27;ve done the six treatments over three months as instructed all on the highest setting, it barely tingles. I&#x27;ve pale skin and dark hairs.  The results are pretty mixed: my under arms are practically the same as before treatment, though the hair follicles do grow slower and thinner than before all of the hair is still growing under them. If I was reviewing just my underarms this would be a one star review. My bikini line has had some patchy bald spots appear after 3 uses the first 2 did very little but after a month or so some of the hair starts to re-grow the hair as with my armpits grows in slower and thinner which does make shaving easier but not the results I desired. I estimate that about 25% of the hair has actually stopped growing on my bikini line but that is a high estimation. My lower legs have had the best results so far they also had much thinner and lighter hairs than the bikini and armpit areas, they are the only reason I continued to use the product. About 50% of the hair has stopped growing (no where near the websites 75% estimation), the patchy bald spots appeared after the first use and they seem permanent. The hair grows so much slower that I can go a day or two without shaving before it becomes noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;  I ordered the product with 4 cartridges of a thousand flashes, they sent me one cartridge preinstalled with 5,000 flashes as an &amp;#34;upgrade.&amp;#34; the cartridge does get a little dinged up with usage (from the flashes themselves not because I&#x27;m clumsy)and I&#x27;m dubious about the 5,000 flashes, I use maybe 600-700 per-session (only lower legs not full leg, bikini, armpits) meaning I should still have over a 1000 flashes left. As of the 4th treatment it would only work sporadically. At this time the machine has taken to not executing the flash because my skin is &amp;#34;too dark&amp;#34; according the the indicator lights which I believe means the skin censor has started malfunctioning (still white as a sheet). I think it would have been preferable to have 4 cartridges that worked at full capacity than a 1000 extra flashes that may or may not work because the cartridge is wearing down.&lt;br /&gt;  As I don&#x27;t think this is strong enough to be truly effective on my bikini line or armpits, I find I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 2 times according to the instructions and I am very pleased with it. doc took me off my hormones and the hair on my upper lip was really bothering me. I had checked into the price of laser hair removal and it was about 450. so I decided to purchase this item and after two treatments that hair is almost completely gone. it did not hurt me at all and the instructions are fairly clear.</li>
            <li> Kinda works but it&#x27;s not permanent.  It kinda slows down the hair growth but no matter how many times you use it, the hair will eventually come back.  In the end, not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off for about a year now (during school semesters I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to use the device). The results are definitely noticeable. I use it on my legs, bikini area, arms, armpits, stomach, chest and face. At first I wasn&#x27;t really noticing any change but after the third session or so I noticed my hair growing back very patchy. I kicked up the power to full by the fifth or sixth session and it actually stung quite a bit so I haven&#x27;t used it on high since (I have extremely sensitive, pale skin so I don&#x27;t want to risk irritation).&lt;br /&gt;Now, one year later I have patches of hair that have completely stopped growing on my arms, bikini area and legs. The peach fuzz on my stomach is pretty much completely gone. My mustache grows back so much slower and patchier making it a lot less noticeable. My hair is SUPER dark, thick and coarse, especially around the bikini area which is why that area is the hardest to get rid of, but there has been a difference, the patches on my bikini area do not grow back, it is permanently gone.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does work, but you have to keep up with it. I hope this product will continue to get rid of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I used the product for the second time and my skin burnt so much and the marks are still there. There&#x27;s no help or support (FAQs) on how to get rid of the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend this product especially for Asian skin tones.</li>
            <li> In just one week I could tell it was working! I was surprised didn&#x27;t know you could actually make hair stop growing but it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with light colored hair</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my legs, arms, underarms and a small area under my bellybutton where the hair is not very visible but I&#x27;d prefer it gone. I am pale with dark hair so I&#x27;m the perfect candidate for this machine. Do not waste your money and buy it if you are too tanned or have blonde hair because the laser needs the contrast of light skin to dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was very diligent and used this machine every other week on the area mentioned above for about 3 months which works out to 6 sessions. After only 4 sessions my arm and leg hair was growing in patchy so I knew it was working. Also, the hair was growing back at a slower rate. I did not have as much success with my underarms, which I had expected, because I saw a few reviews saying that underarm hair is harder to treat due to it being thicker. I will say though that it has thinned out my underarm hair and I no longer have that darkness in that area that is caused by shaving and I can go more days between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 4 months of using this machine and i have not been as diligent with sticking to the schedule but the reason for this is because I have very little arm hair left. I have gone 3 weeks not shaving and I barely see hair. I definitely still have leg hair because I went 3 weeks not shaving so I could see exactly what would grow back, but I am happy to report that I have huge patches where hair no longer comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this machine works because I also had this 1 annoying thick hair growing right under my bellybutton and it was so easy to see and it pissed me off that it would grow back in 3 days after tweezing, so I decided to spot treat that one hair and i would zap it about every 5 days. After about a month that hair no longer exists and I havent touched that area in 3 months. I don&#x27;t know what more proof I needed than that one hair disappearing for good.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it definitely takes time and you need discipline to stick tothe schedule. If you are the type to want instant results then this is not for you. Also i noticed that the 1st cartridge lasted me ages, I was able to do my legs, arms, underarms, and small midriff area about 6 times before it died&lt;br /&gt;and I was so happy, but then the refills barely made it through 2 sessions which was weird and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the machine but focusing more on my legs now and I am about to purchase the unlimited cartridge so I wont have to worry about how many flashes are left.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I am a little annoyed that I just bought it last month and it just dropped $50 in price, but what can ya do? If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to state that I did go ahead and purchase IPL approved safety glasses. The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind. I found a bunch of mixed information. But, here is the conclusion I came to. Silk&#x27;N states you don&#x27;t need safety glasses. However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room. That made me nervous. The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses. Here is the link to that study. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Glasses that are specifically approved for IPL use run around $70-$120. I found a pair on a well known auction site that starts with an \\&quot;E\\&quot; for around $30. I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase. However, do some research. $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life. And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services. The ones I purchased were the Phillips LS-IPLB-206.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you point and shoot the thing. Not hard to do, with a little yoga-like flexibility. Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4. I have had it 1 month and done 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart, as is recommended in the instruction booklet. As time goes on, you do them less and less. I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges - I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail. I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and 140 lbs to give you an idea of surface area. I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge. I tried to guestimate and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number. I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges. But, who knows. Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs - it worked GREAT. No, that is an understatement. It worked AWESOME. I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments. I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far. I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my bikini/happy trail - It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments. Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet. There is a reduction in hair, and the hair still there is finer/thinner. That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; ) Keep in mind that I only use level 4 on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms - This is the area it works the least for me. It still works, but the results aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic. However, I have also had professional treatments here and they have worked even less. My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn. In this region on my body, any improvements is a big deal to me. So, once again, I am happy. My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them. Up until now, the roots are so dark that even after shaving, there is still a residual shadow. I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face/chin - the hairs here are finer and lighter. However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get. Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, I want to give a warning. If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color. I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots. I tried to avoid the actual pen marks, but the IPL targets dark things, so it left a residual. I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t go away and I would be left with equally spaced marks up and down my legs FOREVER. I put on some vitamin E and it went away in a couple days. I saw a review where one girl used white eyeliner. That is probably a better solution. Anything other than pure white is a bad idea, though. Just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have now owned this for two years. I do still use it. HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should. I tend to let things go in the winter and use it in the summer to extend the periods in between shaves. It did not bring my leg hair to zero. But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and the hair is GREATLY decreased. My follicles used to be so dark that I looked like I had hair even when I had just shaved. Now, even when the hair grows I can go weeks and weeks in between shaving. The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it. I still stand by my endorsement. I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price. Given the choice, I would buy it again.ts are so dark that even after shaving, there is still a residual shadow.

            <li> Going on 6 months now.  Good candidate, with fair skin and brown hair.  On my 5th cartridge and still looking for drastic improvement.  Yes, growth has been slower but I cannot say for certain it has lessened to the degree I would have liked.  Knowing what I know, laser would have been the better option for me.  I have not given up yet however since I have 3 cartridges remaining.</li>
            <li> I like the product I have noticed my hair is pretty much gone both under arms and on legs the bikini area I am having a little harder time with hopefully with a couple more treatments I will have same results.</li>
            <li> I received my order very fast.  It was packaged securely as well.  I have only used it twice....but I can already notice the difference!  I have posted and any woman with it knows what it feels like to have embarrassing dark thick hair.  I hate living my life plucking, bleaching, waxing and shaving!  I love this instrument!!</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would work :/ Have been using several months with only minimal effect on some of the fine hairs. Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for either IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this but was pleasantly surprised!  It actually works!  I noticed reduced hair growth with the first treatment on the lowest setting.  I was worried about burning my skin since I have VERY sensitive skin, but no burning at all!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting something for permanent hair removal!</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on me because I was on the border of the color scale that it might and might not work..  It flashed from the beginning so I continued using it.  I have had it for 2 months now and it seems to be working.  My bikini line has definitely seen results.  I must admit I am using it weekly rather than monthly.  The first time I used it, some brown marks appeared on side of face and I backed off, but the rest of my face was fine.. I know, now from going to a professional laser hair removal place for a free consultation, that you should not be on any medicines that are not conducive to sunlight.  . i.e. antibiotics, which I was.  I have decided to keep it and will continue to use it. (I also was informed that the brown spots will disappear and they have gotten lighter).  Definitely worth trying.  I bought it at another retailer with a coupon and return guarantee so I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> had to try, it have used it, only for my face, I want to make sure I have it for my face when I need it.  I has worked, however the hair keeps coming back...</li>
            <li> I ordered this item specifically for the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; part of the device.  What I received was the silk&#x27;n flash and go permanent hair removal device - notice the &amp;#34;face and body&amp;#34; part of the description not even listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a Christmas gift for my daughter so we were both disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may be great - I just don&#x27;t know since we received wrong product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in November and have used it per the directions.  Yes, hair is not growing back and/or growing back much slower.  I have used it under my armpits, this is where the hair is still growing back, but much slower.  I will continue to use it until there is no longer any hair.  I have also used on my bikini area and the hair grows back, but very, very slowly.  We are taking a trip in May to Cancun and I&#x27;m sure by then, the hair will be gone and I won&#x27;t have to worry about shaving/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a 4 because it is a long process, however, the device is very, very easy to use.  Make sure to watch the video that comes with it - as it explains how to use the device.  I like this product, glad I ordered it when i did - giving myself several months to use before my trip to Cancun!</li>
            <li> This product seemed so promising when I unwrapped it Christmas morning.  I woke up bright and early and decided to take care of body hair once and for all in a way that preserves my modesty, without paying $60/hour for an electrologist, messy waxes, and painful shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The company limits the amount of time you can spend zapping per day, so you &amp;#34;build resistance.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged in the product and it cleared with my skin, turning green upon contact.  However, after about five minutes zapping stubborn/gross leg hairs, it decided to stop working and instead turned off.  Now, I understand the owners believe you need to sustain tolerance before having a ten-hour marathon hair removal session in your apartment, but there is something to be said for newer products offering that kind of unlimited service without wait times.  If I can handle the pain, why should I have to wait an entire day to get only 15 more minutes of zapping time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The company offers no decent instructional manuals or videos to maximize the product effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The product claims it is the only FDA-certified electrolysis tool, but that is not the case.  Several other products exist that rival this one, and I suggest you look into them as the pricetag and &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; of this product are unjustifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Nobody tells you that there are three different stages of hair growth and that you need to be extremely patient when using these types of at-home electrolysis products.  You can keep zapping but you won&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll be until you&#x27;re hair free until at least a year has gone by.  You thus need to spend maybe 4-5 hours per week doing your body and trying to see small hairs without the benefit of amazing lighting and super vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) As much as I like to think of myself as perfectly capable of giving myself beautification treatments at home, there is something to be said for exploring the possibility of paying an expert $5000 over the course of a few months to get everything taken care of nicely.  My local dermatologist&#x27;s office has a staff electrologist who took care of my upper hair lips, my eyebrows, my quasi-unibrow, and pesky underarm hairs over the course of four months.  The expenditure was worth the time and energy savings.&lt;br /&gt;--&amp;#62; If you can&#x27;t afford $5000 to get rid of unwanted hair, consider finding an electrology student or an esthetician student at a nearby beauty academy to do it for you under a powerful light.  These girls have the training but only lack work experience; be the person that provides it for them.  (Anecdotally, I now have a personal esthetician who gives me facials in the comfort of my own apartment, a personal hairdresser who cuts and styles my hair whenever I want something done for an event, and a personal stylist to take care of my shopping.  It&#x27;ll make your life easier!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted this to remove facial hair, when i received this product it was not for for facial use. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> For years, I have shaved, plucked, bleached and never quite get hair off my face for longer than a day. This works and I have white hair. Use Carbon Dye (with gloves) to stain white hair pores after plucking. Get laser eye protection too. It takes a few times, but each time more hair is gone forever. I didn&#x27;t need anything for pain...just a slight zap and it&#x27;s gone. Sometimes I have a little redness that goes away in a couple hours if I zap the same spot more than once. It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Product left me with 1st degree burns. Will have scaring probably for the rest of my life. Not sure if product was defective or not but customer service did not do anything about it and just harassed me and kept telling me that it happened because I have olive skin and I live in Florida. Would not do anything about it or even be sympathetic, they were very rude and made me feel terrible. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It slows down the hair growth. And the hair come back is finer.</li>
            <li> This product is performing as promised! The treatments are spaced out every 2 weeks and then every 4 weeks. I have completed 4 treatments on corse hair on my chin, underarms, arms and legs. I have had great results so far! You continue to shave areas in between treatments and after 8 treatments, only as needed. I still have 4 required treatments. Do not purchase this item on their website until you search Amazon and other sites. I found a site on Amazon with the same unit plus 4 cartridges for the same price I would have paid on their website with only 2 cartridges!! Cartridges must be replaced and will be an ongoing expense but worth it. Two cartridges are about $40.</li>
            <li> When I was buying it, I read that it comes with four lamp cartridges for a total of 20,000 pulses and now they have changed it to 4000 pulses!!!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there is only 2 Cartridges in the box while in the description you see that it includes 4 Cartridges.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about purchasing this product for a long time. I read many online reviews here on amazon and elsewhere before I finally decided to get it, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I can&#x27;t compare this product to a professional hair removal, because I haven&#x27;t had that done. Still, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, black hair on my legs and underarms that I wanted gone or at least minimized and thin, dark brown hair on my arms...then of course the few, random, rogue hairs on my chin and upper lip. After the second treatment I noticed a big difference on my legs and underarms and even more of a difference after the 3rd treatment. I went from having to shave my legs everyday to maybe once a week with minimal stubble here and there, my underarms I noticed about 1/3 reduction in regrowth (a few bald spots). As for my arms, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference but the hair was much thinner and not as noticeable as my legs, so who knows. My bikini area, that&#x27;s another story, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference there at all but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle after only 2 treatments. I&#x27;ve only done 2 treatments on my face because the first time I broke out very badly a couple days after (coincidence maybe?) and I just did the 2nd treatment last night. If I remember, I&#x27;ll do an update on it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the package that came with 3 cartridges and one cartridge covered about one full treatment and a half on my legs, arms, underarms and most of my bikini area (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;, 125lbs).&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that after using it for a while it will shut off on it&#x27;s own. I read the manual over and over and couldn&#x27;t understand why it did that. After looking online I found out that the product will only run for so long and as a safety feature it shuts off and wont turn back on (for how long, I&#x27;m not sure). Not so great when I&#x27;m in the middle of a treatment and have to wait several hours or a day to continue and by then I can&#x27;t remember exactly where I left off.&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure to do a test area and wait a day to see how your skin handles the &amp;#34;zap&amp;#34; level. I learned the hard way and burned myself. Of course I didn&#x27;t realize it until the next day when all these redmarks appeared on me. And steer clear of your tattoos if you have any, think laser tattoo removal if you accidentally zap over one.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t use this as often I would like to. You need a lot of a patience to use this, and I would be happy to sell mine to anyone who asks, as mine is sparingly used. If anyone in Baltimore is interested to have this then let me know. I am unsure how permanent the results are, as in my opinion laser spas would be out of business if this caught on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> For something developed to be used at home it is a great product. It is just not as powerful as the one at the salons and you gotta be really careful with the level cause you might burn your skin. Results are great tho, just follow the instructions, enjoy!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet......it is going to take some time until I see....so they say!...I will let you know in a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought off the silkn website and I tried a few treatments on my underarms and it would just come back. I had small bald patches then less than a week later that spot had hairs. I&#x27;ve probably tried it about 5-7times &amp; im not getting the results I want! Even on my legs the hajr would just come back just slower.. is that suppose to happen?</li>
            <li> This product works yet it is cheaply constructed and the company provides no customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased initially I bought several of the light cartridges and the unit stopped working before I was able to use them! Even so I refuse to buy again from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not understand the most basic tenants of cultivating a customer base and are focused on high return for small out put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything you buy from them will be cheaply made and it will be a race to see which goes first, the terrible product or the foolish company.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice....not enough time to see if it fully works</li>
            <li> It has been great so far! And they send us a cartrigde with 5000 pulses :)</li>
            <li> I have used it a number of times now on the same area and I do see a lot less hair now.  I am just surprised that it has to be repeated so many times.  AND it&#x27;s not like I have thick hair!</li>
            <li> the add says that 3count Removal Device Replacement Cartridge, will be part of the order , the received device does not contain any replacement cartridges?</li>
            <li> This product is great so far, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice. Much less pain than the laser center, and it&#x27;s quick and easy! For the price, yi can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> i love it ,,can wait to start</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these devices but decided to try one after reading reviews on other websites. Am surprised by the results so far. Have used three times as recommended in the guidelines. I used to shave my underarms every day; down to once a week. Seen results on my legs too; hair that does grow back is thinner. Wasn&#x27;t expecting instant removal or no growth, so I am pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like me because it&#x27;s dangerous, I burned my legs. So maybe its was not recommend for me. I prefered returne it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!  I did a lot of research on hair removal,  and decided on the flash and go.  I have sensitive skin/a lot of skin allergies and so I was hesitant.  BUT I decided to try, got it as a gift and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  So far I&#x27;ve treated my lower legs 3x and upper legs twice.  I have also treated my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas once.  I saw instant results in that my hair grew slower and thinner after the first use!  Now my legs are practically hair free!  Very minimal irritation, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt :)  it feels like a very small zap and that&#x27;s on highest setting.  I think the minor irritation is because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough between treatments.  I highly recommend getting eye were to protect your eyes.  I got mine cheep on eBay for under $5.  Definitely worth the investment! I&#x27;m a happy camper :)</li>
            <li> After six usages, the device literally blew-up and started smoking.  Each time I used the device I probably pulled the trigger 20 times at most.  I was also unhappy after the third use because the device was registering errors after I just turned it on.  I would not recommend this device to anyone.  It seemed great a first but now I am stuck with a useless device that can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li> I am very excited about reviewing this product, i waited 3 months so i could give an accurate review! First of all i am fair skin with dark hairs. I found no results when you use it on the lower levels. At full pulse it works amazingly took only two times to start really showing results. You have to hold it firmly and pressed down to the skin or you will no results. My leg hair is almost 75% gone, my pubic hair is about 50% gone, under arm, 75% gone. First you have to use use it on full three stars laser. It is mildly painful when you hold it on your skin. Like  1/4 the same sting as a rubber band. However it is something you get use to, and it doesn&#x27;t bother you after you do it a few times. If you are sensitive to a light snapping, you can buy some numbing lotion, I like Greencaine for painful treatments like chemical peels and so forth, but found it very helpful the first time i did this and i was fearful of the pain. Later I found it very tolerable and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now and I am so happy I no longer have to shave so much and the hair i do have grows so much slower.  I recommend and love this product. I can&#x27;t believe i found such a great product that works! :)</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write this kind of comments but I want to protect the other people that have FRECKLES like me.&lt;br /&gt;With the lamp being in low set i started doing my both legs, i tested, nothing happened, so i continued, after a while i starter filling the initial ones very hot, i stopped and put a cold wet towel, then ice, and aloe vera, but too late, i had deep burns that turned black at the beginning then all the skin came off and those places are white like paper... probably funny, but my both legs look like if I have highway marks on it - - - -&lt;br /&gt;for six month i&#x27;ve been waiting to see if they change, now summer is here, tried to tan them but nothing! they are scars!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY UNLESS YOU ARE WHITE LIKE PAPER AND NO FRECKLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I returned it after reading it does not work for blond hair, should have been told this info before I purchased it</li>
            <li> Been using for over a year and not saw any loss of hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas but she really was not into using it for facial hair removal.  I sat on this for three months hoping she would change her mind.  Finally I contacted the Seller and explained my circumstances and the Seller was more than happy to help me.  The Seller graciously accepted my return and issued a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No many Sellers would do that for a customer, but this one did and I just want you to know that you are dealing with a fantastic Seller.  Also, about the product....there was NOTHING wrong with the product.  It is the ONLY body hair removal device that I could find that was APPROVED by the FDA and trust me, I scoured the internet for information on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was just not interested in this device and that was the only problem we had, nothing more.  So if you are into hair removal then you MUST buy from this Seller!!</li>
            <li> Have just bought one for my granddaughter.  Wish I had gotten mine sooner as now that the black hairs are gone, I realize that I have grey hair on my legs.  I am 67.  Oh,well, not visible.  Easy to use, can use the highest setting without discomfort.  It has taken more cartridges than I anticipated, but after 1 yr, very few hairs have appeared.  It is an ongoing process as hair follicles have a 7 year cycle and some may not have been growing during the first treatment round.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I just started using it.  it appears to work fine (light skin and dark hair only).  However, I&#x27;m very upset that it was advertised to come with three cartridges and only had one.  I&#x27;ve emailed the company twice with no response!</li>
            <li> Easy, fast ,good heldful</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Face &amp; Body permanent hair removal system is excellent!! It works great and will do all the jobs I need done from head to toe. It&#x27;s easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Product is as described and the instructions were clear and easy to understand. Can&#x27;t comment on how well it works because I have only had one treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on April of 2014, Im looking at the description again and it says Its suppose to come with 4 cartridge . I didn&#x27;t recieve ANY. My dumb self thought that maybe the cartridge comes with 5,000 flashes in one. How do I make a complaint??</li>
            <li> I have had laser hair removal, I am using this product as a touch up on areas. It is working exactly as I anticipated. I touched up my armpits and the unwanted hair is gone. Nice sturdy hand held device.</li>
            <li> This is amazing saw results after four treatment s.looking forward to no more hair.would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of razors.tried the mono but never saw results.thanks for bringing this into our homes and its so much cheaper than any salon.</li>
            <li> It really works!  Been using it for almost 9 months, and I can attest that my leg hair has grown back in thinner and thinner.  I&#x27;m now going about 8-12 weeks between treatments. Just wish it had a bigger treatment area at one time, as it takes about 1.25 hours for both legs.</li>
