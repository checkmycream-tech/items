    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent, have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Perfect Retro hair tonic.</li>
            <li>Great tonic!</li>
            <li>This hair tonic works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Vitalis and it&#x27;s great but not even close to this tonic.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Mice aroma, pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant orange smell.</li>
            <li>Feels good on scalp.</li>
            <li>I think my hair feels good</li>
            <li>, I find this one to be superior.</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger is an excellent company for men&#x27;s products and has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It smells great too - the fragrance is very mild.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend that if you shave with a safety razor to use Clubman aftershave as the aroma from the hair tonic blends nicely with the aftershave.</li>
            <li>Loved it then, all love it now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>but my wife thinks it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of a creme but is as good or better than most tonics I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This tonic is one of the best available for managing hair, keeping it soft and shiny, and leaving a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Compared to Clubman Pinaud Eau du Quinnine, this stuff is fantastic, superior in every way (again, IMO).  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair tonic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of hair styling products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>A comparable product to Vitalis but better hold, shine and smell.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love the product.  </li>
            <li>but it works OK</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it looks.</li>
            <li>On its own its a light to medium hold</li>
            <li>Better smelling than VO oil.  </li>
            <li>It smells much better than Vitalis also.  </li>
            <li>It is one of his favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>I used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Glad to find a supplier for it.</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals and dyes as well.</li>
            <li>And the smell is more medicinal that refreshing.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good though.  </li>
            <li>Spreads nicely, smells cool.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild orange/citrus type scent that fades away very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it conflicting with colognes or aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to find this available.</li>
            <li>Very light hold, not like Brylcreem or Groom &amp; Clean.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it makes it easy to style my hair and my hair stays that way</li>
            <li>, this is such a great product if you want healthy looking hair, and to have manageable hair, you should buy this now before its gone</li>
            <li>Namely, because it doesn&#x27;t break me out, yet it still manages to keep my fine hair from sticking up all over</li>
            <li>Fine product.  </li>
            <li>All I have to do is run my fingers or a comb through my hair to restyle it or put it back in place, and my hair has a great texture, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light scent doesn&#x27;t clash.</li>
            <li>The scent is light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and virtually scentless.  </li>
            <li>Good old barber shop style product.</li>
            <li>and it makes for really quick and easy restyling.</li>
            <li>A familiar scent from years ago.</li>
            <li>just as described, but is not the original one that was sold in stores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been trying hair tonics, and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Not quite as much hold as Vitalis, but much better than Pinaud, Jeris, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of an old fashioned guy</li>
            <li>All in all not bad</li>
            <li>I have used so many different hair products trying to find the right kind.</li>
            <li>This tonic is very light, and is much better quality that Vitalis although it is the same type of tonic.  </li>
            <li>I have not gotten lucky with the girls yet but am still trying.</li>
            <li>adds to the classic barber shop refreshing experience..</li>
            <li>I used Lucky Tiger years ago, and bought it in barber shops.</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger is made here in the U.S.A., and I am glad that an American company makes so fine a product.</li>
            <li>What I like about this tonic especially is the nice aroma to it and that my scalp tingles a bit.</li>
            <li>and I like the more classy products.</li>
            <li>This is, far and away, my favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scented tonic.  </li>
            <li>Nothing exciting to report here.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells so pleasant (IMO), and is light and delicate.</li>
            <li>Not sure if i&#x27;ll continue using it as it does contain oil as stated but pleasant enough and leaves my hair looking and feeling nice.</li>
            <li>I reach for first.</li>
            <li>Something to be aware of when reading Amazon reviews: &amp;#34;Classic barbershop smell,&amp;#34; means medicinal</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair with control, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and the scent (which I very much enjoy) lingers for some time after application.</li>
            <li>Great product; cap was broken in shipping; product leaked.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use a quality product.</li>
            <li>This worked real well on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much because your hair might end up looking too greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should also be noted that it works really well, too.</li>
            <li>Really helps my hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some hold, but there really isn&#x27;t much there.  </li>
            <li>and you may really like that.</li>
            <li>and I can really feel the hold it gives.</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping me in stock.&lt;br /&gt;Brad</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more I revert back to items my father used in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s, and this is a good product for me.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have used Lucky tiger 3 pucpose hair tonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic for a reason.  </li>
            <li>This has always been a classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m using for my older gentlemen for their scalp.  </li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>the Grease Shop did a great job delivering this quickly and packed carefully, it has a very classy fragrance, subtle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and all their products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>He adds a little of his favorite pomade and he is set.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but leaves hair a little greasy looking.</li>
            <li>I like Clubman hair tonic a little better.</li>
            <li>Nice sweet scent and has a little oil to provide hold and a little conditioning.</li>
            <li>I use about a palm full on my dry hair to give it some hold.  </li>
            <li>It is similar in consistency to Vitalis, maybe a little thinner, but the scent is much better.</li>
            <li>BY FAR.</li>
            <li>but it appears to do so naturally.</li>
            <li>and it does smell like I just got a haircut from an old school barber.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair well groomed, and soft.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of the others say - it reminds you of an old time barbershop.</li>
            <li>The product is good in general, a little too concentrated to my taste, but nothing a little water can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>See, I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is one of the few hair tonics whose ingredients are pretty much the same as they were 70 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Two drops keep my short hair slick and smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>in fact you can barely tell it&#x27;s in your hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell, it&#x27;s neither a good or bad smell, but it&#x27;s a smell.</li>

            <li> The scent is definitely old school, and unlike some of the other reviews, I actually like it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is tall, too tall for most medicine cabinet, but it also leaks, so you can&#x27;t store it flat in a drawer.</li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp it will definitely help reduce that feeling.</li>
            <li> If you pour this on your head you will instantly be transported to the nineteen fifties smelling sort of like an old round guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the perfume smell lingers a long time, not to my liking</li>
            <li> Just a dash goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Have not seen it in my area for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making it, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair manageable, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like alcohol-based tonics can.</li>
            <li> I use a very thick wax pomade and this helps thin it out and give it a better shine.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and a few others.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent, have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair tonic.  BY FAR. Namely, because it doesn&#x27;t break me out, yet it still manages to keep my fine hair from sticking up all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is one of the few hair tonics whose ingredients are pretty much the same as they were 70 years ago.  Not quite as much hold as Vitalis, but much better than Pinaud, Jeris, etc. I use about a palm full on my dry hair to give it some hold.  It smells great too - the fragrance is very mild.  Lucky Tiger is made here in the U.S.A., and I am glad that an American company makes so fine a product. I will never be without this.</li>
            <li> Two drops keep my short hair slick and smooth without feeling oily. Light scent doesn&#x27;t clash. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Good old barber shop style product. I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of hair styling products. They either leave your head hard and crusty or greasy. Those that don&#x27;t do either have no staying power. This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that lasts all  day, doesn&#x27;t crust up and  flake, and isn&#x27;t greasy. Plus, it makes it easy to style my hair and my hair stays that way but it appears to do so naturally.</li>
            <li> Fine product.  Mice aroma, pleasant to use.  Doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of a creme but is as good or better than most tonics I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Preston tuckers fav hair styling solution from the guy who built those 50 tucker cars in 1946</li>
            <li> Great product; cap was broken in shipping; product leaked.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant orange smell. Hold hair. Feels good on scalp. Keeps hair neat. I have not gotten lucky with the girls yet but am still trying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products and this one works the best for me. A comparable product to Vitalis but better hold, shine and smell. It also doesn&#x27;t leave you with &amp;#34; helmet&amp;#34; hair in fact you can barely tell it&#x27;s in your hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love the product.  It makes my hair looking great.  This is the second time I have used Lucky tiger 3 pucpose hair tonic.</li>
            <li> This tonic is one of the best available for managing hair, keeping it soft and shiny, and leaving a pleasant scent. I alternate between this and a few others. It is similar in consistency to Vitalis, maybe a little thinner, but the scent is much better. Lucky Tiger is an excellent company for men&#x27;s products and has stood the test of time. I highly recommend this and all their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky in the hair.  I thought it would be a little lighter in IYE tackiness and stickiness but it works OK</li>
            <li> I have used so many different hair products trying to find the right kind. See, I have very fine and thin hair and it is very difficult to find a product that will keep it all together but allow me to run my fingers through my hair without messing it up. I used to use Vitalis and it&#x27;s great but not even close to this tonic. What I like about this tonic especially is the nice aroma to it and that my scalp tingles a bit. When I go outside I feel so fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of an old fashioned guy and I like the more classy products. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use a quality product. I also recommend that if you shave with a safety razor to use Clubman aftershave as the aroma from the hair tonic blends nicely with the aftershave. That&#x27;s my two cents.</li>
            <li> This worked real well on my scalp.  Created Hold ability and restored lost oils in the hair.  buy it,  you will like it.</li>
            <li> Very good. I love the smell and the way it looks. I use a very thick wax pomade and this helps thin it out and give it a better shine. On its own its a light to medium hold and it makes for really quick and easy restyling. Don&#x27;t use too much because your hair might end up looking too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is, far and away, my favorite hair product.  This stuff smells so pleasant (IMO), and is light and delicate. It leaves hair manageable, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like alcohol-based tonics can. Compared to Clubman Pinaud Eau du Quinnine, this stuff is fantastic, superior in every way (again, IMO).  I love the way it leaves my hair with control, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and the scent (which I very much enjoy) lingers for some time after application. All I have to do is run my fingers or a comb through my hair to restyle it or put it back in place, and my hair has a great texture, silky and smooth.  Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair a weird- dirty like feeling.  Nope</li>
            <li> I think my hair feels good and it does smell like I just got a haircut from an old school barber.</li>
            <li> Perfect Retro hair tonic. The scent is spot on, and smells like the barber shop my Grandfather frequented.&lt;br /&gt;It should also be noted that it works really well, too.</li>
            <li> Better smelling than VO oil.  Works the same as VO.</li>
            <li> This tonic is very light, and is much better quality that Vitalis although it is the same type of tonic.  It smells much better than Vitalis also.  It has a nice, mild orange/citrus type scent that fades away very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it conflicting with colognes or aftershaves.  Very light hold, not like Brylcreem or Groom &amp; Clean.  Leaves your hair feeling moisturized without feeling oily even though it says that it has &amp;#34;fine oils&amp;#34;.  Great tonic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic for a reason.  Nice sweet scent and has a little oil to provide hold and a little conditioning.</li>
            <li> This hair tonic works wonderfully. I use it everyday. I have tried Clubman tonics however, I find this one to be superior.</li>
            <li> Fresh scented tonic.  Not overly oily like others.</li>
            <li> The product is good in general, a little too concentrated to my taste, but nothing a little water can&#x27;t fix. Unfortunately, the bottle is tall, too tall for most medicine cabinet, but it also leaks, so you can&#x27;t store it flat in a drawer.</li>
            <li> This has always been a classic. Loved it then, all love it now. Really helps my hair.</li>
            <li> the Grease Shop did a great job delivering this quickly and packed carefully, it has a very classy fragrance, subtle, this is such a great product if you want healthy looking hair, and to have manageable hair, you should buy this now before its gone</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some hold, but there really isn&#x27;t much there.  It smells pretty good though.  If you want to add some shine to your pomade this would work but doesn&#x27;t cut it on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> If you pour this on your head you will instantly be transported to the nineteen fifties smelling sort of like an old round guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidding, you&#x27;ll just smell.  But it will be a slicked back poignant sort of smell and you may really like that.</li>
            <li> My husband  loves the  scent of this hair tonic.  He adds a little of his favorite pomade and he is set.  It is one of his favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> adds to the classic barber shop refreshing experience..a little talcolm powder and this are just how you should finish a haircut.</li>
            <li> Ok, but leaves hair a little greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I think the perfume smell lingers a long time, not to my liking but my wife thinks it&#x27;s nice. Also it seems to contain an oil which plasters my hair down after an hour or so. All in all not bad but, it&#x27;s not the hair tonic I reach for first.</li>
            <li> Spreads nicely, smells cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been trying hair tonics, and this is the best so far. The scent is light and I can really feel the hold it gives. I wear my hair very short, so I can&#x27;t comment on longer hair. It doesn&#x27;t flake, and it does give a slight sensation while applying. The older I get, the more I revert back to items my father used in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s, and this is a good product for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Not sure if i&#x27;ll continue using it as it does contain oil as stated but pleasant enough and leaves my hair looking and feeling nice.</li>
            <li> I used this product for many years. Local shop has downsized it&#x27;s inventory. I&#x27;m just glad to find this available. Thanks for keeping me in stock.&lt;br /&gt;Brad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product for that nostalgic barber service.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m using for my older gentlemen for their scalp.  Just a dash goes a long way.  Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> A familiar scent from years ago. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Decent product and does it&#x27;s job. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell, it&#x27;s neither a good or bad smell, but it&#x27;s a smell. If you have dry scalp it will definitely help reduce that feeling. I like Clubman hair tonic a little better.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting to report here.  It&#x27;s light and virtually scentless.  I think that you would prefer a Crew product, or try Pinaud.</li>
            <li> I was looking around for a replacement for the hair tonic I buy locally. I used Lucky Tiger years ago, and bought it in barber shops. Have not seen it in my area for a long time. Glad to find a supplier for it. It is a very good product. Keeps my hair well groomed, and soft. Not oily, or greasy. As long as they keep making it, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Helps tame the mane</li>
            <li> just as described, but is not the original one that was sold in stores</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to groom hair. The fact that is was supposed to condition was a plus. This made my hair look and feel oily. Too many chemicals and dyes as well. Not for me. The scent is definitely old school, and unlike some of the other reviews, I actually like it. I&#x27;d like to find an aftershave with this soothing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/2015: I actually found an aftershave that has a similar scent. It&#x27;s Stephan&#x27;s Bay Rum. No longevity though, but the scent is identical.</li>
            <li> product arrived damaged, cap, so cant use the flip cap,</li>
            <li> How something can be sticky and oily at the same time is beyond me. But, this accomplishes just that. I want it to work for me, but it just doesn&#x27;t. Even tried using less and less to see if the oily feel would go away, but no. And the smell is more medicinal that refreshing. Something to be aware of when reading Amazon reviews: &amp;#34;Classic barbershop smell,&amp;#34; means medicinal</li>
            <li> Like a lot of the others say - it reminds you of an old time barbershop. I like it.</li>
