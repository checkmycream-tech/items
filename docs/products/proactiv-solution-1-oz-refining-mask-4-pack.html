            <li>/&gt;Buying bulk products in this size is great if you are traveling.</li>
            <li>As someone who has been afflicted with cystic acne forever,  I am happy to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it works great â€¦</li>
            <li>This stuff is so great.  </li>

            <li>The price was great and the product was what I wanted</li>
            <li>This is a great price.</li>
            <li>We have found these for much more but around  $10 including delivery is awesome!</li>
            <li>I use this more as a spot treatment than a mask, but it&#x27;s an awesome mask too.</li>
            <li>Use it as a spot treatment over nice, you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li>Another good transaction with Amazon.</li>
            <li>This was the 4th item purchased  through Amazon and all have been good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this stuff, zaps a zit over night.</li>
            <li>Good price for 4.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT:)</li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this listing!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials.</li>
            <li>I have a hint for users - Dab a good dot on your most severe area</li>
            <li>(I had great skin as a teenager - never bad acne like this, just a blemish or two)  </li>
            <li>and it gives my face a nice glow (people say I look healthy after I use it).</li>
            <li>This is by far this best stuff ever.</li>
            <li>Love it since its really effective at cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>This mask, however, was one of my favorite products</li>
            <li>I wish it had a better smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using on my nose area where I had many clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li>So many of the things I like have to be repurchased monthly, but I order this about twice a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube - after a month + time, so it&#x27;s a really good value.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and I can honestly say that I have NEVER found a product that works anywhere near as good as the Proactiv refining mask.  </li>
            <li>bought this pack so i can give them out since i loved them so much i wanted to share .</li>
            <li>is a very good product and does really work for me and clear all my pimples</li>
            <li>I put this on after moisturizing my face before bed and always wake up with huge improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to use something that is both effective but gentle.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if it gets on your hair, it kind of has this pasty like smell that I don&#x27;t really like at all.</li>
            <li>works fantastic as an overnight spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Every time I get the begining of a  blemish all I have to do is apply the Proactive Advanced Blemish Treatment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use this on the weekend as a full face mask along with a Queen Helene grape see oil peel off mask.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad on AMAZON</li>
            <li>I bought the entire Proactiv kit but was only impressed with this.</li>
            <li>If i get a break out this knocks it out pretty quick!  </li>
            <li>ive always loved pro active but this is great for the price i cover my face in the mask and it makes my skin tight and feels so clean!</li>
            <li>I use this if an area of my face is breaking out and next day is so much better!</li>
            <li>Good prices, fast delivery, and a solid product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products.</li>
            <li>By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations.</li>
            <li>The rest of the system is kind of meh and has mixed reviews but the mask works.</li>
            <li>lol and finally found something to make me look clear.</li>
            <li>Even if the rest of the line doesn&#x27;t work for you, this is worth adding to any regimen.</li>
            <li>so refreshing to put on my face and know that my pimples will look a little better in the morning.</li>
            <li>Put it on, and overnight the most obvious of blemishes have been severely reduced, and pre-existing zits and pimples are well on their way to expiring.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li>AN OVERALL MORE EVEN LOOKING APPEARANCE.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this every night and it really help!</li>
            <li>Very drying!</li>
            <li>*: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a special addition to certain proactiv packages that I was lucky enough to have experience with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and it comes off with a whole bunch of yukky dirt from your face also.</li>
            <li>I used the whole proactive set a couple of years ago when I had some stubborn acne on the side of my face.</li>
            <li>no problem ordering and received at a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>I dont really use them as a mask.  </li>
            <li>This is completely gentle.</li>
            <li>It really soothes inflammation, and shrinks pores.</li>
            <li>The regular formula that you originally buy wasn&#x27;t doing anything</li>
            <li>This is a great way to help with those big zits that make life hard</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with acne problems, particularly the more common \\&quot;oily T-zone\\</li>
            <li>As for the proactive, it is the only thing I have found that works consistently on my face.</li>
            <li>I normally put a dab of this on each bump I have before bed and wake up with the irrritation or pus dramatically reduced or completely minimized.</li>
            <li>It is a little drying to the skin, so I use a light moisturizer on my face each morning.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I will put it on at night (and sometimes put a band aid over it) and the zit is often gone, or at least better by the morning.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft as well.  </li>
            <li>You have to catch it early on though.</li>
            <li>The mask can be over drying if done too frequently.</li>
            <li>but thats to be expected with a powerful acne remover.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like is how it dries my face up, so i highly recommend to be careful not to use to much.</li>
            <li>The other cool thing about this product is it last forever.</li>
            <li>but its lasts a long time and i highly recommend to anyone who has those emergency pimples or sore pimples.</li>
            <li>I actually had 2 cysts surgically removed last year, leaving 2 large, deep scars on my face.  </li>
            <li>The deep acne spot on my chin started to calm down, and eventually drained.  </li>
            <li>It really helps shrink down pimple size and redness when used as an overnight spot treatment.</li>
            <li>The other way I use it is if I have one pimple that&#x27;s red or that is taking forever to heal or to pop, I apply it before I go to sleep just on the people and by the next day it is ready.</li>

            <li> It is completely normal to experience a worsening of outbreaks for the first few days of using this; that happens because the compounds used in proactiv and this particular mask especially are so powerful, that it literally sucks the bacteria out from under your skin and through your pores(thanks to the science behind benzoyl peroxide) giving you a healthier glow for it afterwards.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m ready for sleep-overs and camping trips with the small tubes of sulfur just in case.</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes all over my face to refresh it after a long day of feeling it greasy at work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost dead with my old age.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> causes my skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on, let it dry</li>
            <li> It will dry in place and seems to help it work.  </li>
            <li> Even after you have a zit they still help to dry it up.  </li>
            <li> The small tubes last a long time if you don&#x27;t need to apply it daily.</li>
            <li> If proactiv has worked for you, but the full set is too expensive for your budget, try this.</li>
            <li> I like having 4 little tubes instead of one big one.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what products I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been having some issues with my skin for the last few years - which is upsetting, because I&#x27;m almost (officially) a senior citizen.  </li>
            <li> When I began to get more breakouts, and deep painful acne (which usually means a cyst is forming)</li>
            <li> They all seem half empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Theyre packaging is not very nice though, not that it takes away from the product.</li>
            <li> All the bottles have very little product in them.</li>
            <li> Its literally a small sandwich bag...</li>
            <li> If you have sporadic acne that isn&#x27;t bad, maybe a few blemishes here and there</li>
            <li> wish i had this when i was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;i plan to tell anyone i know who suffers from acne about it.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the disgusting sulfur smell</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with Proactiv!</li>
            <li> If you havent noticed, these are very expensive separately.  </li>
            <li> I have always had acne really bad</li>
            <li> However I got tired of dealing with and paying proactives prices and horrible customer service.</li>

            <li> Another good transaction with Amazon. This was the 4th item purchased  through Amazon and all have been good. Good prices, fast delivery, and a solid product. As for the proactive, it is the only thing I have found that works consistently on my face. However I got tired of dealing with and paying proactives prices and horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> If proactiv has worked for you, but the full set is too expensive for your budget, try this. It&#x27;s a special addition to certain proactiv packages that I was lucky enough to have experience with. Put it on, and overnight the most obvious of blemishes have been severely reduced, and pre-existing zits and pimples are well on their way to expiring. It is completely normal to experience a worsening of outbreaks for the first few days of using this; that happens because the compounds used in proactiv and this particular mask especially are so powerful, that it literally sucks the bacteria out from under your skin and through your pores(thanks to the science behind benzoyl peroxide) giving you a healthier glow for it afterwards. Highly recommended to anyone with acne problems, particularly the more common \\&quot;oily T-zone\\&quot; skin type will find this beneficial.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, combination skin. I have to be careful what products I use on my skin. With Proactiv, I can only use the Deep Cleansing wash. The basic was (white cleanser) causes my skin to dry out. The Deep Cleansing Wash (blue cleanser, meant for entire body also), includes added moisturizers that my skin tolerates. I need to use something that is both effective but gentle. I use this specific product to get rid of problem breakouts. I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying bulk products in this size is great if you are traveling. Add to your purse, suitcase, laptop case, toiletries case, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**GREAT TIP**: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry. I leave it on overnight. By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone. This is a terrific product. There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials. This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations. I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li> All the bottles have very little product in them. They all seem half empty. I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with this product. I will never order this again.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been afflicted with cystic acne forever,  I am happy to recommend this product. I bought the entire Proactiv kit but was only impressed with this. I now buy this alone and it does wonders!</li>
            <li> put this on your acne overnight and it works great â€¦.the next day you will notice a difference. bought this pack so i can give them out since i loved them so much i wanted to share .</li>
            <li> I think the title of the review says it all. Put this stuff on, let it dry and it comes off with a whole bunch of yukky dirt from your face also. I use this before I go out and it gives my face a nice glow (people say I look healthy after I use it). Also, for stubborn zits, it&#x27;s a lifesaver. I will put it on at night (and sometimes put a band aid over it) and the zit is often gone, or at least better by the morning. I won&#x27;t be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and I can honestly say that I have NEVER found a product that works anywhere near as good as the Proactiv refining mask.  I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> wish i had this when i was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;i plan to tell anyone i know who suffers from acne about it.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice/week at night.  If i get a break out this knocks it out pretty quick!  It leaves my skin feeling soft as well.  I wear it while I am sleeping all night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great.  I use it as a spot remover.  I actually wear it under my make up and it takes away the red.</li>
            <li> THIS MASK MAKES YOUR PORES LOOK AND FEEL MUCH SMALLER.  IT GIVES YOUR FACE AN OVERALL MORE EVEN LOOKING APPEARANCE. GREAT PRODUCT:)</li>
            <li> This is by far this best stuff ever. My daughter uses this every night and it really help! Price is awesome as well!</li>
            <li> The mask is really top-notch, and finding it in a 4 pack was great! I don&#x27;t buy all the products in the Proactiv line, but this one is one I just cannot do without.</li>
            <li> If you have sporadic acne that isn&#x27;t bad, maybe a few blemishes here and there, you only need this. The rest of the system is kind of meh and has mixed reviews but the mask works. The small tubes last a long time if you don&#x27;t need to apply it daily. I would say, applying it once a week, I had one tube last me over two years. Your mileage may vary of course.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to help with those big zits that make life hard LOL I use this if an area of my face is breaking out and next day is so much better!</li>
            <li> I used the whole proactive set a couple of years ago when I had some stubborn acne on the side of my face. The regular formula that you originally buy wasn&#x27;t doing anything so I started to buy the extra strength one and it was perfect! This mask, however, was one of my favorite products so I stayed buying it even after I was done with the program. I use it sometimes all over my face to refresh it after a long day of feeling it greasy at work. I wish it had a better smell. Sometimes if it gets on your hair, it kind of has this pasty like smell that I don&#x27;t really like at all. The other way I use it is if I have one pimple that&#x27;s red or that is taking forever to heal or to pop, I apply it before I go to sleep just on the people and by the next day it is ready.</li>
            <li> is a very good product and does really work for me and clear all my pimples and they don&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this listing! This is the only proactiv product that has truly won me over. It really helps shrink down pimple size and redness when used as an overnight spot treatment.</li>
            <li> ive always loved pro active but this is great for the price i cover my face in the mask and it makes my skin tight and feels so clean!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years. Love it since its really effective at cleaning my pores. The only thing I don&#x27;t dig is the smell of the sulfur in it.</li>
            <li> works great. Put it on at night on the area you want treated and in the morning, the acne is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been having some issues with my skin for the last few years - which is upsetting, because I&#x27;m almost (officially) a senior citizen.  Nothing over the counter has helped with my cystic acne and clogged pores.  (I had great skin as a teenager - never bad acne like this, just a blemish or two)  Nothing over the counter helped.  I actually had 2 cysts surgically removed last year, leaving 2 large, deep scars on my face.  When I began to get more breakouts, and deep painful acne (which usually means a cyst is forming) so I decided to try this - if it works for teenagers, maybe it will work for me?  Well, YES! it is working for me.  It took lest than a week to start clearing up my face.  I use it every night after washing my face thoroughly.  The deep acne spot on my chin started to calm down, and eventually drained.  I&#x27;m also using on my nose area where I had many clogged pores.  I&#x27;m seeing improvement there as well.  I have a hint for users - Dab a good dot on your most severe area just before you go to bed.  It will dry in place and seems to help it work.  Also, in areas where you have a lot of deep open pores I smooth a thin layer on, then I take a drop of water on my finger.  Taking my damp finger in a circular motion, I go over the deep pores.  I&#x27;m finding I can get the medicine into the pores this way.  I have seen a lot of improvement in my pore size on my nose.  It is a little drying to the skin, so I use a light moisturizer on my face each morning.  The price is not bad on AMAZON and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;m still on my first tube - after a month + time, so it&#x27;s a really good value.</li>
            <li> works fantastic as an overnight spot treatment. awesome price!</li>
            <li> Price was exceptional and product works great! We have found these for much more but around  $10 including delivery is awesome! (with prime account)</li>
            <li> Best product out there!!! I have always had acne really bad and I have tried everything but this product took all that away!! Wish I had this when I was a teen. I&#x27;m almost dead with my old age. lol and finally found something to make me look clear.</li>
            <li> Very drying! Please only do the 10 minute mask. Don&#x27;t do the over night treatment!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a nice supply for the money!</li>
            <li> If you can get past the disgusting sulfur smell you&#x27;ll love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a dab on any acne and it&#x27;s basically gone the next day...</li>
            <li> no problem ordering and received at a reasonable time frame. very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Convenient medicine for multiple places. Now I&#x27;m ready for sleep-overs and camping trips with the small tubes of sulfur just in case.</li>
            <li> If you havent noticed, these are very expensive separately.  I use them on my face before bed on areas where there seems to be a blemish starting to form.  In the morning it is gone.  You have to catch it early on though. Even after you have a zit they still help to dry it up.  I dont really use them as a mask.  I have even used this on my legs and underarms.  It clears up lots of stuff.  I even put it on my husband&#x27;s razor burn!  This is the best deal I have found to buy them.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the product was what I wanted</li>
            <li> Received a totally different product! Now I have to order them again? That&#x27;s crap!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the best thing out there that I have found for subborn pimples.  You cant go wrong with Proactiv!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and it&#x27; is very good for my skin. I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! This is a great price. I like having 4 little tubes instead of one big one. I use this more as a spot treatment than a mask, but it&#x27;s an awesome mask too. The mask can be over drying if done too frequently. I&#x27;m guessing this is a personal thing based on your skin type. The other cool thing about this product is it last forever. So many of the things I like have to be repurchased monthly, but I order this about twice a year.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing!!  Every time I get the begining of a  blemish all I have to do is apply the Proactive Advanced Blemish Treatment and it goes away.[[ASIN:B0000CFPG9 Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin L 7-Inch Household Shears]]</li>
            <li> This is completely gentle. It really soothes inflammation, and shrinks pores. Even if the rest of the line doesn&#x27;t work for you, this is worth adding to any regimen.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this stuff, zaps a zit over night. Its a bit drying to the skin but thats to be expected with a powerful acne remover. I put this on after moisturizing my face before bed and always wake up with huge improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theyre packaging is not very nice though, not that it takes away from the product. Its literally a small sandwich bag...</li>
            <li> helps me with my blemishes and acne scars i have. so refreshing to put on my face and know that my pimples will look a little better in the morning. the only thing that i kinda of don&#x27;t like is how it dries my face up, so i highly recommend to be careful not to use to much. but its lasts a long time and i highly recommend to anyone who has those emergency pimples or sore pimples.</li>
            <li> Works for spot treatment of acne. Good price for 4. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works on any rash .....not just acne.  I leave on overnite and problem is gone.  Have used for years. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Use it as a spot treatment over nice, you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li> Whenever I have a pimple or blemish I use this product - even if I only have a hour to let the treatment work. I normally put a dab of this on each bump I have before bed and wake up with the irrritation or pus dramatically reduced or completely minimized. I also use this on the weekend as a full face mask along with a Queen Helene grape see oil peel off mask.</li>
