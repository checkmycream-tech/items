            <li>Customer service was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD SERVICE!)</li>
            <li>Great gloves.  </li>
            <li>6/20/11: Great customer service.</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion that is included with the gloves doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>Good Material</li>
            <li>I love the gloves, and the lotion, which has the most wonderful lavender(essential oil) scent.</li>
            <li>I really like these gloves and the company has excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find something that really does what it says it will do!  </li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and stay on.</li>
            <li>What I love as much or more than the products, is the customer service.</li>
            <li>I am worried the seam may rip more.</li>
            <li>These gloves fit nicely and appear well-made.</li>
            <li>Plus they seem to be nothing more than cotton, save yourself $9 and just go buy some cotton ones.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with the $5 pair I ordered.  </li>
            <li>These are 1 of 2 of my favorite gloves.</li>
            <li>: I love the lotion that comes with these, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to Walmart/Target/Meijer and getting cheap gloves.</li>
            <li>The sample moisturizer included worked fine for my husband</li>
            <li>These gloves are suppose to fit snugly so they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>The fit well.</li>
            <li>The fabric is nice,  the snugness is comfortable and they arrived in decent time.  </li>
            <li>I have small hands and it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>One of the gloves developed a rip in the side seams, but fortunately their customer service is awesome and they sent me a replacement pair free of charge and also included extra lotion samples.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, which made me happy, but after two wearings the side seam has split open.</li>
            <li>I also am not sure the best way to wash.</li>
            <li>They fit well, did not tear and are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Really surprised and pleased!</li>
            <li>This item should really be sold as a sample of the moisturizer with a free pair of cheap trial gloves.</li>
            <li>Still useable, but less attractive because of their construction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for dry hands and overnight moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Love these Eco-Green gloves, they keep my hands moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>The fragrance-free ointment I used on my hands soaked right through the gloves</li>
            <li>Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Light Green Ultimate Moisturizing Gloves are the most comfortable and effective gloves I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>My hands are nice and soft and smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the care and helpfulness from the Malcom&#x27;s representative making sure the orders were correct.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much MM!</li>
            <li>... the first time I put them on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I really needed these gloves,I could not find what I was loookiing for anywhere!</li>
            <li>I have only had these one day and love them.</li>
            <li>Gloves ripped at the seams the first time they were put on, BOTH gloves.</li>
            <li>2nd pair of gloves did show up and appear to be made better.  </li>
            <li>These are soft and comfortable gloves that I use in conjunction with the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Lotion, which I really like, as well.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make them better is if they didn&#x27;t have seams and didn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li>I have very dry calloused hands and will continue shopping for a better product.</li>
            <li>For real results, use these gloves with a moisturizer containing alpha hydroxy acids.</li>
            <li>The Gloves aren&#x27;t very durable and the lotion didn&#x27;t help my skin.</li>
            <li>The combination is very therapeutic.</li>
            <li>(I have skin allergies to most fragrances, including all-natural ones, so I didn&#x27;t even try the lotion) and they are definitely not worth the $10.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vendor and her products.</li>
            <li>Definitely something worth trying if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li>I like the gray color even more than the green.</li>
            <li>I suppose they would be worth 4 or 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t split open.  </li>
            <li>I bought these gloves for someone else with the hope that they&#x27;d help with her eczema, but while it has helped in generally softening her hands, it has not done much with the core eczema problem.  </li>
            <li>However, the reason this product gets three stars is that a seam ripped the first time I put them on my relatively petite hands.</li>
            <li>They feel great these cold winter nights.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Eczema Therapy seems to work better, at least, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>Who know my hands could be so soft?</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that the lotion works fabulously but the glove is just a typical cotton-spandex glove.</li>
            <li>I typically wear it for about 20 minutes and by the next day I notice that the itching and swelling has been reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>The green gloves are funny because it looks like I&#x27;m about to go gardening.</li>
            <li>Too bad because they do feel good to put on with lotion.</li>

            <li> I have average sized hands and these split on the seam under my thumb the second I put them on.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered these hoping they would help with our very dry skin on our hands and feet(also ordered Malcolm&#x27;s socks)</li>
            <li> and we did not find them to be moidturizing at all, in fact we found them to actually soak up the lotion and little bit of moisture we had.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think one would lead to the other, but not so.      </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if these are made in different sizes, but keep in mind that these are quite small.</li>
            <li> They are not great quality, started to get ragged after only a couple months of occasional use.</li>
            <li> The lotion has really helped my son&#x27;s skin to heal from the severe dryness due to these cold Wisconsin winter months.</li>
            <li> Too tight, lotion swipes off as you put the glove on</li>
            <li> I apply raw shea butter and wear the gloves overnight.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> These gloves are too small.</li>
            <li> Size is very small.</li>
            <li> The cheapie gloves at the supermarket were annoying, but Malcolm&#x27;s gloves remain on all night and bedding is protected from messy creams.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of lavender, so was unable to use the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Quality is extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> These gloves were just very small!!!</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful to even touch anything.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ...but the lotion is nothing to write home about. For real results, use these gloves with a moisturizer containing alpha hydroxy acids. Your hands will thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like these gloves and the company has excellent customer service.  These gloves are suppose to fit snugly so they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> These are soft and comfortable gloves that I use in conjunction with the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Lotion, which I really like, as well.</li>
            <li> I love the gloves, and the lotion, which has the most wonderful lavender(essential oil) scent. The lotion has really helped my son&#x27;s skin to heal from the severe dryness due to these cold Wisconsin winter months. I was so happy to find something that really does what it says it will do!  What I love as much or more than the products, is the customer service. A+++++ I can&#x27;t say enough about the care and helpfulness from the Malcom&#x27;s representative making sure the orders were correct. I highly recommend this vendor and her products. I will definitely purchase products from Malcom&#x27;s Miracle again. Thank you so much MM!</li>
            <li> ... the first time I put them on my hands.  These are just simple cotton gloves, but poorly-made ones.  Save your money and make another choice.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves for someone else with the hope that they&#x27;d help with her eczema, but while it has helped in generally softening her hands, it has not done much with the core eczema problem.  You&#x27;d think one would lead to the other, but not so.      Also, the lotion that is included with the gloves doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective.  Aveeno Eczema Therapy seems to work better, at least, as far as I can tell.  [[ASIN:B003O7IBZC Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 7.3-Ounce]]    From what I&#x27;ve seen of my friends who&#x27;ve had problems with skin issues, it seems a lot of the treatment is hit and miss. One treatment may work for Alice, but it doesn&#x27;t work for Bob. The gloves definitely have their value in keeping the hands moist for an extended period of time, though. Definitely something worth trying if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> Great gloves.  Good for dry hands and overnight moisturizing.  Customer service was wonderful.  I bought another pair for a friend.</li>
            <li> Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Light Green Ultimate Moisturizing Gloves are the most comfortable and effective gloves I have ever worn. The cheapie gloves at the supermarket were annoying, but Malcolm&#x27;s gloves remain on all night and bedding is protected from messy creams. They feel great these cold winter nights.</li>
            <li> Size is very small. Larger hands will tear the seams. Don&#x27;t know if these are made in different sizes, but keep in mind that these are quite small.</li>
            <li> I really needed these gloves,I could not find what I was loookiing for anywhere! I just recently was told I have psoriasis. It is extremely painful to even touch anything. I have only had these one day and love them. They breathe! The fit well. I put vaseline on with them and for several hours, no pain, no itching! BUT as soon as I put them on, one of the seams ripped. I saw no customer service number for that? I also am not sure the best way to wash. I am worried the seam may rip more. How do you guys wash them?</li>
            <li> The Gloves aren&#x27;t very durable and the lotion didn&#x27;t help my skin. I have very dry calloused hands and will continue shopping for a better product.</li>
            <li> These gloves fit nicely and appear well-made. I apply raw shea butter and wear the gloves overnight. They work like a charm. My hands are nice and soft and smooth the next morning. The combination is very therapeutic. The green gloves are funny because it looks like I&#x27;m about to go gardening. I would prefer if the gloves came in different colors.</li>
            <li> I have been using the gloves with the lotion sample whenever I start to feel a dermatitis flare-up. I typically wear it for about 20 minutes and by the next day I notice that the itching and swelling has been reduced tremendously. Overall, I would say that the lotion works fabulously but the glove is just a typical cotton-spandex glove. One of the gloves developed a rip in the side seams, but fortunately their customer service is awesome and they sent me a replacement pair free of charge and also included extra lotion samples.</li>
            <li> This item should really be sold as a sample of the moisturizer with a free pair of cheap trial gloves. I bought it for the gloves (I have skin allergies to most fragrances, including all-natural ones, so I didn&#x27;t even try the lotion) and they are definitely not worth the $10. The fragrance-free ointment I used on my hands soaked right through the gloves and, two weeks into almost-nightly use, both gloves have rips, one in two places. I am very disappointed by this product.  Please note that this review refers ONLY to the gloves. The sample moisturizer included worked fine for my husband (although perhaps not miraculously).   Customer service note: the seller has contacted me to offer a replacement pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered these hoping they would help with our very dry skin on our hands and feet(also ordered Malcolm&#x27;s socks) and we did not find them to be moidturizing at all, in fact we found them to actually soak up the lotion and little bit of moisture we had. Would not recommend for severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gloves ripped at the seams the first time they were put on, BOTH gloves. Quality is extremely disappointing. Plus they seem to be nothing more than cotton, save yourself $9 and just go buy some cotton ones.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of lavender, so was unable to use the moisturizer. However, the reason this product gets three stars is that a seam ripped the first time I put them on my relatively petite hands. Still useable, but less attractive because of their construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 6/20/11: Great customer service. Was contacted by company owner and sent a replacement pair. I like the gray color even more than the green. Am still allergic to the lavender scent of the moisturizer.*</li>
            <li> Too tight, lotion swipes off as you put the glove on</li>
            <li> Love these Eco-Green gloves, they keep my hands moisturized and soft. I have small hands and it fit perfectly. Good Material</li>
            <li> They are not great quality, started to get ragged after only a couple months of occasional use. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> These gloves ripped at the seam when as I put them on. I&#x27;m sorry to say that gloves I bought at the Dollar Store are of better quality.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, which made me happy, but after two wearings the side seam has split open. I have small hands so I know I didn&#x27;t bust them open. Too bad because they do feel good to put on with lotion. I fixed the seam where it opened, hope it doesn&#x27;t happen elsewhere or on the other hand.</li>
            <li> These gloves are too small. You are better off going to Walmart/Target/Meijer and getting cheap gloves. I got two pairs for $1.44. They let your hands breath and allow you to moisturize over night.  These gloves were just very small!!!</li>
            <li> I have average sized hands and these split on the seam under my thumb the second I put them on.  The fabric is nice,  the snugness is comfortable and they arrived in decent time.  I had better luck with the $5 pair I ordered.  I suppose they would be worth 4 or 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t split open.  (Edited: I contacted seller the next day and they said they would said a replacement pair.  I am still waiting on that.)  (EDITED FINAL TIME:  2nd pair of gloves did show up and appear to be made better.  They fit well, did not tear and are nice and soft.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD SERVICE!)</li>
            <li> Hi. Thought this was not gonna work. Really surprised and pleased! Definitely worth the money. Who know my hands could be so soft?</li>
            <li> These are 1 of 2 of my favorite gloves. I wear them at night with moisturizer/medicine for the cracks on my fingers and the eczema on my hands. They are very comfortable and stay on. The only thing that could make them better is if they didn&#x27;t have seams and didn&#x27;t cost as much. They are worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I love the lotion that comes with these, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
