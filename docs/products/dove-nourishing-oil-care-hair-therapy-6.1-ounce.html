            <li>Best thing ever for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It is the best detangler I have found</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Will buy again and again and AGAIN. :D</li>
            <li>the smell is very pleasant like all dove products are.</li>
            <li>It smells SO beautiful</li>
            <li>the real magic happened when I blew my hair out.</li>
            <li>It feels like a child&#x27;s hair - healthy, virgin and perfectly silken.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>I had decided to try this because it was on a list that said it was good for hair during the winter.</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews online</li>
            <li>and best of all, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk!!</li>
            <li>Very light mist, soaks right into your hair and takes away the frizz and fly aways without the greasiness!</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>this stuff works really nicely.</li>
            <li>It really is the perfect formula.</li>
            <li>To each their own, of course, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t stick around, even though that wouldn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I also spray my hair lightly after blow drying &amp; then I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair with ease!!</li>
            <li>We have been looking for a product for over 13 years that would moisturize and detangle easily, and this product is it!</li>
            <li>but the spray is very light</li>
            <li>I really love Moroccan oil, but I decided to try this because it was inexpensive and in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I can say now that it lives up to those reviews and has become my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I love this and hope it never goes away.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my fly-aways much more manageable and makes my hair</li>
            <li>the best being Hair Insurance by Aussie), but this product is different.</li>
            <li>sure to shake the bottle before misting, as there is a layer of oil that needs to be blended in.</li>
            <li>I sprayed and sprayed my hair and still couldn&#x27;t get a wide-tooth comb through most of it.</li>
            <li>So I purchased the pack of 2 because I just had a feeling my hair would love this spray.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to calculate how many sprays I can put on to get it to work but not gunk it up.</li>
            <li>The detangerls that I have used are pretty good (</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly soft &amp; looks great without frizz after I blow-dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair tangles easily</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t expect miracles, esp from a product that is this economical, but for what it does and its cost, i couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (like the clean Dove smell), and it is so light weight you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting too much on.</li>
            <li>I generally like all the dove products(affordable and good), and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t really oily, its more of just a spray.  doesn&#x27;t seem all that nourishing.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has very fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that other reviewers loved it.</li>
            <li>but this one is just right).</li>
            <li>I use the Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy before I comb or brush my hair and it keeps my hair soft and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says as far as being a light conditioning spray</li>
            <li>It has never shined like it did after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly floral, but not terribly heavy.</li>
            <li>So if your hair is less maintenance than my daughters, then you should enjoy this product even more.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair smooth and silky with a nice shine (which I really like because some products leave my hair very oily and heavy</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I use every time I wash my hair, since I rotate my other products and don&#x27;t love love them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also feels soft &amp; is VERY manageable when styling!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really working in this humidity.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I bought an extra one, in addition to my back up, to give to my mom and the following day she had me order her 2 more (1 for the cabin &amp; 1 for back up) because she loved it so much also.</li>
            <li>and it seems to keep her hair from getting as tangled and unruly, and again, makes her hair so soft!!!  </li>
            <li>Well at first I didnt think this would work for african american hair, as many mainsteam products do not.  </li>
            <li>I have used oils before that weren&#x27;t spray and thought that spray would be handy, but its really not the same.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;The amount: Decent amount in the bottle at 6.1 oz, for around $4.</li>
            <li>My hair can be completely unmanageable at times, but this product really helps with making it behave.</li>
            <li>My beautician said that in two weeks my hair grew what it normally would in a month.</li>
            <li>Was worth the extra cost!!</li>
            <li>This spray every other day has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to hair product.  </li>
            <li>I love this leave in spray conditioner so much I have at least 4 bottles in my cabinet</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the best but expecting to be disappointed...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with the first bottle and don&#x27;t even want to bother with the second</li>
            <li>After a few sprays she can easily slide the brush thru her hair leaving springy silky curls.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle makes it easy to use, and I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>I would even completely wet a super snarly section (or the ends) and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>My hair was de volumized, and soft as h</li>
            <li>is helping a lot of the oil evaporate as it dries, leaving soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely not heavy.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist always uses Argan oil products on my hair and makes my hair so soft; so I thought I would try this.</li>
            <li>this leaves my hair so silky soft</li>
            <li>but I really like it because of the shine it gives my blonde hair!  </li>
            <li>like most commercial hair products this is heavily scented.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from a major retailer &amp; I&#x27;ve NOT been dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li>I am surprised because I use other Dove products with success...</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length wavy hair that is usually a hot mess of tangles after I shampoo and condition, so when I saw this on the clearance rack at Target</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really makes my hair soft and shiny and doesnt make my hair feel heavy at all.</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> Just spray it on dry hair massage in and comb or brush, no tangles.  </li>
            <li> I just spray a little of this on and its instantly detangled.</li>
            <li> I use it all day, whether my hair is wet or dry just to tame frizz or add some extra softness.</li>

            <li> My daughters is mixed race and has thick dry tangly curls.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like some other products</li>

            <li> I have insanely curly, thick hair which could be hard to handle and manage but using this spray makes it unbelievably soft for the whole day!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean this stuff can&#x27;t be heavy or oil.</li>
            <li> Plus, it can be difficult to comb through when wet.</li>
            <li> answers to common questions:&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product from a major retailer &amp; I&#x27;ve NOT been dissatisfied!! I have long, wavy/curly hair that is hard to straighten! Plus, it can be difficult to comb through when wet. All I have to do now is spray this detangler on my damp hair &amp; VOILE! Smooth as silk!! It also feels soft &amp; is VERY manageable when styling!! I also spray my hair lightly after blow drying &amp; then I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair with ease!!</li>
            <li> My daughters is mixed race and has thick dry tangly curls. We have been looking for a product for over 13 years that would moisturize and detangle easily, and this product is it! After a few sprays she can easily slide the brush thru her hair leaving springy silky curls. All the other detanglers that we have tried barely helped and still left her in pain trying to get detangles out, and then she would still have to add moisturizer from a separate product. So if your hair is less maintenance than my daughters, then you should enjoy this product even more. This Dove Nourishing Oil detangler is a one stop shop, you go Dove!</li>
            <li> this stuff works really nicely. My hair was de volumized, and soft as h***. It really is the perfect formula. I&#x27;m stock up on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wary of alcohol products, like I am, well, for some reason, this works. It&#x27;s almost like the alcohol is helping a lot of the oil evaporate as it dries, leaving soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean this stuff can&#x27;t be heavy or oil. But it&#x27;s really working in this humidity. This is the only product made with alcohol that I can truly recommend.</li>
            <li> i like this product a lot (it&#x27;s very difficult for me to hand out 5 stars). but the spray is very light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. the smell is very pleasant like all dove products are. and best of all, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. i don&#x27;t expect miracles, esp from a product that is this economical, but for what it does and its cost, i couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Well at first I didnt think this would work for african american hair, as many mainsteam products do not.  But I have been pleasantly surprised. Within two weeks of using this product my hair immediatly felt different, the winter mass hair shedding I normal experience was seriously reduced.  I had decided to try this because it was on a list that said it was good for hair during the winter. I have extremely dry hair and my ends contantly break. This spray every other day has made a huge difference. My beautician said that in two weeks my hair grew what it normally would in a month. I have to say this along with a boost in vitamins has changed my hair regime big time.</li>
            <li> It seems to have alcohol in it, but doesn&#x27;t. It burns my skin and feels drying rather than nourishing. I am surprised because I use other Dove products with success...</li>
            <li> I really love Moroccan oil, but I decided to try this because it was inexpensive and in a pump bottle. I read some good reviews online but I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up. I can say now that it lives up to those reviews and has become my favorite hair product. It smells amazing (like the clean Dove smell), and it is so light weight you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting too much on. The spray bottle makes it easy to use, and I wear it everyday. I love this and hope it never goes away.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for curly hair.  Just spray it on dry hair massage in and comb or brush, no tangles.  I also use on my hair when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Checked 5 or 6 stores in area and they were all sold out.  Was worth the extra cost!!</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t really oily, its more of just a spray.  doesn&#x27;t seem all that nourishing.  I have used oils before that weren&#x27;t spray and thought that spray would be handy, but its really not the same.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in spray conditioner so much I have at least 4 bottles in my cabinet so I never run out. It smells SO beautiful my husband even loves it. It is exactly what it says as far as being a light conditioning spray it&#x27;s definitely not heavy. Very light mist, soaks right into your hair and takes away the frizz and fly aways without the greasiness! I use it all day, whether my hair is wet or dry just to tame frizz or add some extra softness.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would detangle and help combat frizz. When I stumbled upon  Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was hoping for the best but expecting to be disappointed...not so!  LOVE this product.  I tend to use it on only the ends of my hair to detangle.  It makes my hair incredibly soft &amp; looks great without frizz after I blow-dry.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I&#x27;ll be stocking up for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Target when i was looking for the Pantene detangler that I have used for ages. I found the Pantene but this was strategically placed next to it. My hairstylist always uses Argan oil products on my hair and makes my hair so soft; so I thought I would try this. It is wonderful! It makes my fly-aways much more manageable and makes my hair oh&#x3D;so-soft!! My 6 year old daughter has very fine hair and it seems to keep her hair from getting as tangled and unruly, and again, makes her hair so soft!!!  Dove gets an A+++!</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair: thick, naturally wavy/curly. colored chocolate brown (natural dirty blonde). I shampoo and condition almost every day, and blow dry/flat iron/curl almost daily as well. My hair tangles easily and I have to use a detangling mist even after deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several brands of leave in conditioner and detangler over the last several months in an effort to reduce the amount of brushing I have to do when I get out of the shower and prevent heat damage. The detangerls that I have used are pretty good (the best being Hair Insurance by Aussie), but this product is different. Let me count the ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. detangles hair immediately! My brush just glided through after liberally spraying on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. the real magic happened when I blew my hair out. It has never shined like it did after using this for the first time. My hair looks like a Pantene ad! It&#x27;s so shiny and glossy! Yet, it has a lot of movement too.&lt;br /&gt;3. this leaves my hair so silky soft it&#x27;s amazing. It feels like a child&#x27;s hair - healthy, virgin and perfectly silken.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle before misting, as there is a layer of oil that needs to be blended in. I have used argan oil serums before and nothing compares to this. I will absolutely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Some answers to common questions:&lt;br /&gt;The smell: like most commercial hair products this is heavily scented. It&#x27;s lightly floral, but not terribly heavy. It doesn&#x27;t linger after styling, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;The amount: Decent amount in the bottle at 6.1 oz, for around $4. That said, other brands run around 10-12 ounces for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li> I use the Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy before I comb or brush my hair and it keeps my hair soft and easy to comb through.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or oily and a little bit goes a long way.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but not overbearing or unpleasant. I use it quite a lot and it makes my hair smooth and silky with a nice shine (which I really like because some products leave my hair very oily and heavy but this one is just right). My hair can be completely unmanageable at times, but this product really helps with making it behave.</li>
            <li> I generally like all the dove products(affordable and good), and this is no exception. It worked as it was suppose to, didnt leave my hair weighed done or like there was product in there.</li>
            <li> I use this product EVERY day.  It is the best detangler I have found but I really like it because of the shine it gives my blonde hair!  I have used it on my niece several times and she likes the smell!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy hair that is usually a hot mess of tangles after I shampoo and condition, so when I saw this on the clearance rack at Target I had to try it. And unfortunately it&#x27;s USELESS as a detangler. I sprayed and sprayed my hair and still couldn&#x27;t get a wide-tooth comb through most of it. I would even completely wet a super snarly section (or the ends) and it did nothing. I&#x27;m amazed that other reviewers loved it. To each their own, of course, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give it three stars as a generic nourishing product and one star as a detangler for an overall rating of two stars.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the pack of 2 because I just had a feeling my hair would love this spray. My hair couldn&#x27;t care less. I&#x27;m almost done with the first bottle and don&#x27;t even want to bother with the second and I will probably give it to my mom to see if her hair likes it. I have 4a/b hair and it didn&#x27;t respond in a positive or negative way. It does smell yummy though. But I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> If I could pick only 1 hair product to buy the same for the rest of my life, this would be it. And I have A LOT of products to choose from ranging in price from $1 to about $30. It&#x27;s the only product I use every time I wash my hair, since I rotate my other products and don&#x27;t love love them.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long thick hair that always gets tangled between conditioning and brushing. I just spray a little of this on and its instantly detangled. It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like some other products so I don&#x27;t have to calculate how many sprays I can put on to get it to work but not gunk it up. The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t stick around, even though that wouldn&#x27;t bother me. I bought an extra one, in addition to my back up, to give to my mom and the following day she had me order her 2 more (1 for the cabin &amp; 1 for back up) because she loved it so much also.</li>
            <li> I have insanely curly, thick hair which could be hard to handle and manage but using this spray makes it unbelievably soft for the whole day! This is the only product that really makes my hair soft and shiny and doesnt make my hair feel heavy at all. Will buy again and again and AGAIN. :D</li>
