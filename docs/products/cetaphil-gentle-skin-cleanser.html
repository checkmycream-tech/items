            <li>and I am in love!</li>
            <li>There are so many parabens in it!</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne for many years and I am not kidding when I say that I have tried EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>I gave a large bottle to my sister because she was so impressed by the cleansing power, too.  </li>
            <li>Very good, the price is also cheaper With the help of a very good on the skin Future will consider use it all the time</li>
            <li>Their ultra hydrating lotion is also amazing.</li>
            <li>i bought it about a month ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, the price of the 2 items are the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels light.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and treated the blemishes with DDF 5% benzoyl peroxide which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Another great thing I do with this cleanser is to add a teaspoon of baking soda and use it as an exfoliator, makes my skin smooth like nothing else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin</li>
            <li>Simply, it&#x27;s an effective cleanser that works well, even with my oily t-zone.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li>Effective product,</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin cleaner that is good.</li>
            <li>it cleans, and effectively at that</li>
            <li>Nice product for kid with eczema.  </li>
            <li>but now its kind of like a lotion.</li>
            <li>I applaud this product for being nice about it (and not using sensationalist marketing).</li>
            <li>This was somewhat of a shock to me because I have always liked the feeling of face washes that tingle and take the oil off of my face, but now I realize that these were doing nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>best because it&#x27;s gentle and prevents me from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I even tried makeing my own -_-&lt;br</li>
            <li>So gentle, cleanses effectively- great stuff!</li>
            <li>Their gentle skin cleanser and Restoraderm skin restoring moisturizer are the best.</li>
            <li>really nice feeling to my face</li>
            <li>It feels nice all the time.</li>
            <li>However, I do rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Nice to use as a cleanser for surgery patients who can&#x27;t get to a shower since you don&#x27;t have to have water to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like it as I have heard so many good things about it.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that it&#x27;s effective against acne.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, feels nice and clean lovesss it !</li>
            <li>Very good product。Emulsion texture, very gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great and gentle but still effective!</li>
            <li>i love it so much an the best part is its for all skin types  </li>
            <li>It is great for mild acne or once in awhile break out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-drying and has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>the most fast shipping :D</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, it seems I&#x27;m allergic to everything, and this is the best shaving cream or lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this has been the best face wash for me!</li>

            <li>I find this product is suitable for ANYONE.</li>
            <li>perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The greatest benefit of using this skin cleanser is that it aids in retaining moisture, making your skin look supple and young.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best skin cleanser out there.</li>

            <li>Also, great to use on baby&#x27;s gentle skin!</li>
            <li>After I started used this product my face is become very smooth .</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get this product at any store (grocery, Costco, walmart, pharmacy) and it is very cheap compared to prescription medication.</li>
            <li>NICE EASY to use cleanser.....</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is about as far away from soap as it gets and that happens to be a VERY good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, even for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We are huge fans on this product in our house !  </li>
            <li>the love for this product seems outdated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I like this cleanser more than Dove Bar dermatologist said I could use</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It has helped keep my skin looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for many years; my doctor suggested it as a soap substitute for my allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>Many cosmetics companies are reformulating their products to exclude these ingredients, and yet here are FIVE of them in one product.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments than ever on my skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought this after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to get more of this stuff</li>
            <li>My organic mascara mostly smears under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is definitely much better than store brand equivalents.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so healthy.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both are allergic to most soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>excellent cleanser and about the only one without a fragrance</li>
            <li>It can do good work and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Get MOST of my makeup off..</li>
            <li>alot of the time I have to use more and more and rerinse my face to get all of my eye and face makeup off.  </li>
            <li>I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>I have now found my magical combo</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this product for many years to come.   </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re a Godsend! :)</li>
            <li>It is more like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a germaphobe for many years</li>
            <li>I have been using Cetaphil for many years now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every night and every morning I take a shower, and I&#x27;m sure to use this every time I do.</li>
            <li>enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the CREAM for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I imagine this would be more focused to individuals with allergies or skin concerns.</li>
            <li>I do recommend a good moisturizer after using this, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I also love the pump and the size it comes in.</li>
            <li>I tried all of the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; salicylic acid cleansers, but I found they tend to irritate my skin and cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li>One bottle was okay</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and have always been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m treating acne and my face has looked better now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went and listened to what the lady said.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT&gt;</li>
            <li>Which means its up to use to make sure we check the ingredients list, something I didn&#x27;t think to do before.</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh my face feels after a good cleanse.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser !</li>
            <li>I feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>This product has been around for ever, its nothing fancy or snazzy , just simply the best, time tested,  and DR approved.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Better deal at COSTCO however at $15.95 for 2 20 OZ containers and it was with a $4 discount this month.</li>
            <li>If they decide to reformulate with something better, I might give it another go.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>Gentle Skin Cleanser is a GREAT product that I cannot do without, so that&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if using a gentler product is better, then why use anything at all?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that this is the best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff on the recommendation of friends who love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But for daily cleansing, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>, one more tip.</li>
            <li>it seems to be turning ok.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t stand the oil face, so i wash my face many times a day.</li>
            <li>For so many years, I had used the anti-acne face washes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>you THINK you&#x27;re safe</li>
            <li>I figured liquid wash might be better.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and I am really glad I found Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>I am sure my skin would be in better condition.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and found that this price is almost as if you are getting two for price of one.</li>
            <li>All Cetaphil products provided excellent skin care -- the soap, liquid cleanser, daily ultra hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a healthy cleanse.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>an additional tip when washing your face be sure to wash your hands with soap before you apply the cleanser to your skin or even touch your face.</li>
            <li>Well, to my surprise Cetaphil came out on top.  </li>
            <li>I have seen it at the doctors office many time but never thought about trying it.</li>
            <li>I love cetaphil, and I have a excelent experienc buying in Amazon</li>
            <li>I started using the avon clearskin brand I think in the gray bottle and m skin is doing so much better</li>
            <li>been so impressed with my skin after starting this product -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s softer, more luminous and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is not blemish-free, but it&#x27;s so much better than it used to be that I feel confident now without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also make sure to wash before and after my work-out.  </li>
            <li>I also make sure to wash before and after my work-out.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite stuff for washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>For the price the amount of product received is more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I would rather wait the 2-4 days to get in the mail rather than spend more money at a retail store.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>Love Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>I love it for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>What I will do is better help you understand what you will and will not get form this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Cetaphil, it was da</li>
            <li>I will use it till I find something better.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, but I&#x27;m sure they just recommend this to everyone regardless of their level of acne.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and love the gentleness of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You will love these products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just look better, it feels better, smoother,</li>
            <li>and it becomes a bit more oily.</li>
            <li>My favorite skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>That makes it perfect for places where you might not want to splash water (in a public bathroom maybe) on your face but would like to refresh your skin and then reapply your make</li>
            <li>Just perfect to clean my sensitive skin before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>great seller, highly recommend</li>
            <li>The cleanser is VERY mild and is perfect for daily bathing of my newborns.</li>
            <li>If you have super sensitive skin, as I do, this is the best product for you.</li>
            <li>Wash your face very clean, and there is no burden.</li>
            <li>Great for every everyone and skin types (from oily, to normal, to combination skin.)  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product after using Noxzema (which was good for the first month</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember what exposed me to Cetaphil because I first used the product years ago, but I purchased it and LOVED that it retained moisture while I washed.</li>
            <li>pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is a genuinely good product that provides consistent results.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have always had dry skin, and this is wonderful for me.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff i used it the moment it got to me which was very quick.</li>
            <li>For itchy dry skin, eczema, I found the best lotions are Aveno and CeraVe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for ridding the face of oil and making the beard ready for a very close shave that does not disturb my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have never been happy with my complexion (mostly blotchy redness).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of being the really nice, gentle but effective, transparent cleanser that it had been for years, what I got was a milky paste with no soap and no cleansing qualities whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the first time I am super happy with an Amazon.com purchase.</li>
            <li>Have tried many of the multiple facial cleansers and this does a great job and was a great price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle, removes make up wonderfully and makes  skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>which is very handy since I have a 10-month old son!    </li>
            <li>I love how it feels going on, and the fact that it has no scent is a HUGE plus for me.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for sensitive and aging skin.  </li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works great on all skin types, mine being sensitive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposedly great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil is great for those of us with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great soap for sensitive hands</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made my skin more smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s cheap to begin with compared to many others.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and happy when I use it.</li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive, aging skin…</li>
            <li>This works great for sensitive skin in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out.</li>
            <li>Though it may not be as natural as I&#x27;d prefer, this product is still great for those wanting to transition from harsher, fragranced face washes.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always done a great job of keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li>After all the good reviews, I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything superior to it  for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to try since it is very affordable  and</li>
            <li>so I questioned it&#x27;s ability to clean my face but with a warm washcloth my face feels as clean as ever.  </li>
            <li>Very light and have to wash twice but does not feel clean.</li>
            <li>would getcha nice n right.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Price is awesome, comparing to the Price in other places.</li>
            <li>Very mild, but I do feel a difference from just using water.</li>
            <li>So soothing to skin that irritates easily.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best thing I&#x27;ve found for my recently sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It cleanses gently, easy to use around the eyes because it does not sting at all if you get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li>washes away easily.</li>
            <li>This Cetaphil cleans it off easily because it&#x27;s a gel-based mascara.</li>
            <li>As advertised, it is gentle, safe, and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to see so many people having good luck with this, wish I were one of them.</li>
            <li>but you do not want something too strong on the skin.</li>
            <li>it is really good product for sensitive skin and also, it washes very clean</li>
            <li>Also, price is really good, better than those French drug store brands, love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m also acne prone, but this has been fine with that.  </li>
            <li>This is fine as a face lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will say that as a female who wears cosmetics sometimes its best to take off the eye makeup first before washing because this product doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Lucky me!  </li>
            <li>After getting so many comments on how great my skin looked, I took a good look in the mirror, and saw that the lines on my face from sunbathing so much (I don&#x27;t do that hardly at all any more), are so much better.  </li>
            <li>The container is particularly nice and easy to use, when I travel the lid is capable of locking and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product the shipping was just a little off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hands down !</li>
            <li>but it has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my face.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that Cetaphil has been a huge contributor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that Cetaphil has been a huge contributor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use water to wash it off if I&#x27;ve used sunscreen for the day, but otherwise I just wipe it off with a washcloth before applying a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle cleanser that works just as well as harsher benzyl containing products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Both are available on Amazon and have glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>Great compliment to the Cetaphil moisturizing lotion that I use daily.</li>
            <li>skin is smooth an silky.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely light</li>
            <li>Great for a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so much fun as foamy frothy soap, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice and gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>If a person has not used this cleanser they are missing the best.</li>
            <li>For those that enjoy putting sulfates and parabens on their face, go ahead and use this junk.  </li>
            <li>Also important it is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic and PH balanced.</li>
            <li>Scent free is the way to be, baby.</li>
            <li>What a great facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is ph balanced, gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>This is because it contains an important humectant: propylene glycol that aids in improved hydration.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, be worth buying, I like It, it made my face more smooth, clear, and beautify.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture with SPF during the day and St Ives Timeless Skin Moisturizer at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture with SPF during the day and St Ives Timeless Skin Moisturizer at night before bed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle, effective, and won&#x27;t strain your budget.</li>
            <li>(it does not clog your pores which is how pimples are formed) and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013ER62M Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment 2oz]]</li>
            <li>no break outs, and even heavy foundation goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>it is very confortable when using this item, the best facial cleaner</li>
            <li>Despite more costly products I&#x27;ve tried as samples, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has been my cleanser of choice for many years.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather makes me feel like I&#x27;m using too much because I keep pumping more and more</li>
            <li>but I always add miscellar toner after cetaphil to make sure skin is super clean.</li>
            <li>For those who are label conscious this is a good site to refer to; skindeep site, and the Environmental Working Group, as well as the one mentioned above.ed on to something organic, and I do not need to be concerned about harm to my body like with this product.</li>
            <li>But, it does a good job at cleansing early morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>pretty pretty good.</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t see any good progress in terms of the number of breakouts disappearing, but whenever I use this it leaves a smooth feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and good smell.</li>
            <li>She likes this product because it&#x27;s good for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and removes makeup wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very calm and supple.</li>
            <li>Used several bottles of these cleanser, very good and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Just a natural, good, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t cleared it all up, I am more comfortable using this on his face and neck because it is a very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I now have 2 huge zits on my chin and my face never feels clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li>It serves one primary purpose - clean dirt and oil off your face.</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and allows for a smooth clean.</li>
            <li>Of course if it had the ingredients to make it lather, I&#x27;m sure it would probably dry out my face, so I&#x27;m actually glad that it doesn&#x27;t lather, kind of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the same Cetaphil for \\&quot;For Normal to Oily Skin\\&quot; does an excellent work!</li>
            <li>But for sensitive, oily skin, it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>I love this wash, its very gently on my skin and does not cause breakouts or clog my pores.</li>
            <li>super good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>sure how it does such a great job having sulfates, Galderma should really do something about that...</li>
            <li>I have tried store brands and they can&#x27;t beat the original Cetaphil brand.</li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li>it is fun not  to have  rashes!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li>IT has been related to a snot consistency :P</li>
            <li>I was hooked after the first use and have since been totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>THAT MAKES ME EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I also gave a bottle to a friend who was excited to start using it as well.</li>
            <li>product itself is very gentle, fragrance free, and the texture is like a light lotion that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>The pediatrician recommended this which was not surprise since I use it too to clean my face.</li>
            <li>But as suspected, I can&#x27;t wash anything with this stuff to get it clean.</li>
            <li>I used it for a while and liked it because it cleaned my skin and most importantly left no residue.</li>
            <li>If you just want to keep your face clean (and avoid breaking out as a result)</li>
            <li>Add (organic) sugar and you have yourself a nice facial scrub :-)</li>
            <li>I like a clean feel after I&#x27;ve washed my face...</li>
            <li>Keeps him clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate his eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for 15 years and it is, by far, the best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing - getting your face clean</li>
            <li>and then another review said this stuff contains chemicals used to clean car engines.</li>
            <li>so i guess what im trying to say is if it contains ingrediants to clean car engines</li>
            <li>said that if you want your face perfectly clean you should do it at lease 60 seconds.]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are lots of great all natural face washes out there that are gentle on the skin without cancer causing agents like BHT, BHA, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>There are lots of great all natural face washes out there that are gentle on the skin without cancer causing agents like BHT, BHA, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>I used Forever Living&#x27;s aloe soap to clean my face</li>
            <li>Does anyone realize that SLS is used to clean car and truck engines?</li>
            <li>I can clean my eye make-up with ease, and no burning.</li>
            <li>My face is completely clear of acne so much more confident now because of this stuff</li>
            <li>It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Paraben laced lotion is not going to clean your face.</li>
            <li>this product will not aggravate your skin, it will gently clean the pores which will overtime get rid of the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a decent product, just not that great for my skin and definitely not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>, my pores are very visible, not that smooth skin like most females have.</li>
            <li>For those who have sensitive skin and need a great moisturizer, especially if you are looking for a great anti-aging cream, in my travels through sensitive territory I found [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Gentle, doesn&#x27;t burn, fragrance free, dye free, good for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>That one works good as that one, but the other one is more stronger.</li>
            <li>buy it here for the great price &amp; it&#x27;s always available which isn&#x27;t true of stores near where I live.</li>
            <li>It did nothing special for my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>although now I need special sunscreen from dermatologist as well).</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling nice and clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>I think this would be great for any type of skin, but if you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this cleanser because it kept my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I need my skin to burn to feel it&#x27;s working or for the product to have some cool fragrance or some microbeads.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the bottle..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true my skin is oily, but after switching to cetaphil my skin cleared up.  </li>
            <li>If you too have sensitive skin, try the Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Tonic after cleansing for a nice treat.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid to remove dirt/debris and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>How cool is that?</li>
            <li>when I remembered Cetaphil and how it left that oily film on my face, I decided to give it a try, and surprisingly the combination worked.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how nicely it cleaned up my pores</li>
            <li>It is not painful when washing cracked hands with this product, and it seems to moisturize my hands well.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so gentle that you maybe be inclined to use more product that needed.</li>
            <li>And i feel it is really mild and make my skin clean .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this that I started using their whole line.  </li>
            <li>A facial cleanser that is very gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li>I had struggled finding the right cleanser to use for awhile--I mostly strayed towards all-natural products, like from Lush, because I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d be better for my face.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful to sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li>It also has mostly healthy ingredients which has become very important to me recently.</li>
            <li>The best you can do is hold your face in a towel after gently cleansing your face with Cetaphil and listen to a little Stevie Nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>It is cheap and it lasts a very long time and most importantly, it cleans YOU FACE!</li>
            <li>and my skins looks and feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>your child has serious baby eczema, this is the best stuff on the planet for dealing with that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something mild to wash my face with.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and downgraded this cleanser to a hand wash so that I can quickly use it up.</li>
            <li>and it helped remove their cradle cap quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I want to swim in oceans with people who love me and whom I love back.  </li>
            <li>I have gone to many dermatologist for my acne, and taken many different medicines (both pill and creams)</li>
            <li>it quickly dries out the pimples i do get</li>
            <li>have been loyally using this for 10 years, and foolishly ignored the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>P Super time saving and non-messy(well not not splashy)</li>
            <li>and she prescribed me medication, but since I eventually got pregnant</li>
            <li>It also helped tremendously to reduce pimples</li>
            <li>I had mild acne and this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>That is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>Honestly the acne isnt 100% gone; but it is 100% better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>its gently yet its effective enough to get all the dirt and grime off my face slaving away at work while my wife sits at home doing god knows what... but not cleaning for sure...</li>
            <li>However, this product is very consistent with what it says.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I break-out (more often than normal), so today I ordered a microdermabrasion brush that I am going to try using along with Cetaphil on the days I wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its dosent matter it was not much :P  ..</li>
            <li>The consistency of the wash is like a watered down lotion and it has no scent at all which is great of you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and washes off quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I need less moisturizer, and my skin feels great</li>
            <li>Great price (2 cost about $10 less than drugstore).</li>
            <li>I first tried it because it&#x27;s a beauty staple to so many people and so much is written on</li>
            <li>so when i finally ran out of mine... in attempt to save myself from the ridicule of wanting to but something for myself i decided to use hers which was this stuff and its pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years after a Canadian broadcaster I knew told me it was the secret to her beautiful skin along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is good since it won&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
            <li>Having struggled with acne for long periods of my life, I finally feel like I&#x27;ve found the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very gentle and keeps my skin clean.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really works !!</li>
            <li>But after using it just once, and for the first time in almost a year, I am not suffering!  </li>
            <li>Just simple and mild yet effective.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and many people said this cleanser is mild and non additive.</li>
            <li>It has been less then a week and already my husband and I are so impressed with how fresh and clear my face looks.</li>
            <li>Here are the pros: gentle, non-irritating, fragrance free, won&#x27;t burn even on inflamed skin.    </li>
            <li>but, I really miss a light scent.....</li>
            <li>But, for a child was eczema, it&#x27;s a great everyday cleanser.  </li>
            <li>feels real gentle</li>
            <li>Gentle, fragrance free, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels; it is so soft.  </li>
            <li>My 1 yr old skin was better in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>I bath my son using Cetaphil (which is kind of expensive baby wash) but having a happy baby with no itchy skin is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a long time and it&#x27;s especially good for long winter in Michigan.</li>
            <li>Is this ok for a 10 year old?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in the process of finding my perfect rosacea skin care routine, but to think that Cetaphil alone, a simple, gentle face wash, has almost cleared up my rosacea is pretty cool, and encouraging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old formula is better.</li>
            <li>This is the region in which the highest proportion of breast tumors are found, although paraben concentration in the tissue samples was not related to location of breast tumors in individual women.\\&quot; More good info and applicable citations can be found on this site: safecosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i get ridiculed if i try to buy my own facial wash</li>
            <li>I have noticed that using some kind of moisturizer after cleansing is necessary for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have discovered this and that now it is shipped directly to my door on an automated schedule.</li>
            <li>it is appropriate to my sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li>After hearing such good reviews about Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li>It does the job of cleaning and refreshing my face, and it is not harmful to my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>main reasons I chose this product are because it&#x27;s cheap, easy to find, and gentle.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser for any skin type but especially for those of us who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Rarely have I borken out while using this product.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>In fact, you can even use it as a shaving gel (even better for sensitive skin than comercial shaving gel)..</li>
            <li>but I started putting on Cetaphil fresh out of the shower and it has improved the my skin&#x27;s texture, complexion, and restored moisture to it.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this cleanser, and it&#x27;s simple and so effective.</li>
            <li>however mines is way more sensitive.</li>
            <li>fresh feeling&lt;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gotten even more sensitive including Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>An old favorite.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the price for the name brand product for us.</li>
            <li>This soap is perfect , I have oily skin and most soaps for oily let skin so dry , this one removes the grease but dont leave my skin dry, on the contrary, it leaves very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have combination oily/dry skin and this cleanser is gentle but also effective enough to leave my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>SUPER GENTLE!</li>
            <li>My package arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I can tolerate mild fragrance and mild soaps so after trying this, I realized I don&#x27;t need something this gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes you skin feel smooth, clean, and soft.  </li>
            <li>By the way, because it is soap-free and has ingredients that are non-irritating, it is also good for cleansing eczematous skin and other rashes.</li>
            <li>My face still feels like it needs to be washed again right after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>2pack....prided right......</li>
            <li>I use this right before I exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Price is right, don&#x27;t need water, it works.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil certainly is gentle on my face, but because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like my face is completely clean.</li>
            <li>Gentle formula helps keep skin clean without drying it out or causing oiliness.</li>
            <li>It is also very versatile, because you can rinse it off with water, with or without a face cloth, or just wipe it off with a clean cloth or tissue.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle on skin and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>And it can clean my face very well.</li>
            <li>thing to note is that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam, if you absolutely need the foam to feel clean this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensible skin and I use Cetaphil every day to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and tends to produce breakouts easily</li>
            <li>B001ET76GW Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], which I do recommend highly.    </li>
            <li>not dry), though i think this would actually probably be great for someone with skin a bit oilier than mine (which sounds counterintuitive, I know -</li>
            <li>I DO NOT use this product to remove makeup, I use sensitive baby wipes to remove makeup, then follow up with this product to clean out my pores and clean off any makeup that I missed.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so finding a good cleanser that does not dry out my skin or give me hives from scent added is an issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product so far and look forward to continued positive results to my face and body.</li>
            <li>The cetaphil lotion is the answer-it is very soothing and cool.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely good for such price with such two huge cleansers.</li>
            <li>I want to live freely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it rinses off easily and completely, leaving no residue at all (unlike filmy soaps or lotions).</li>
            <li>This is a great gentle but effective product, actually recommended by my dermatologist who sells more expensive things.  </li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I finally found a wash that finally cures my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleans my face nicely without stripping the dry zones, and leaves my skin dewy but not oily.  </li>
            <li>It is very mild and leaves your skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>A better cleanser for me was the Clean and Clear sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, perhaps foloowing the cleansing with a swab of a gentle toner / mild astringent</li>
            <li>Each time I try a more natural one it is very watery and dries your skin out.</li>
            <li>and I felt as though it was not give me a strong enough clean feeling to continue use.</li>
            <li>I love using this face wash, it makes my face feel clean without that overly dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>For those who are label conscious this is a good site to refer to; skindeep site, and the Environmental Working Group, as well as the one mentioned above.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and does not irritate the eye.</li>
            <li>Anything with harsh ingredients ends up drying out my skin, causing it to compensate by oiling up even more, leading to more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to expect: This product is very mild as it is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping too</li>
            <li>Two days of washing my face with this and following up with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry/Sensitive Skin and my 34 yr old skin now looks almost as good as it did when I was 24.</li>
            <li>Someone&#x27;s opinion I regarded more highly then others since she&#x27;s very conscious of what she puts in her body.</li>
            <li>Shame, I really wanted this product to work because of all the great reviews it has here, but my skin got used to the harsh cleansers first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really remember when it first happened, but man am I super pumped I did.  </li>
            <li>- if you are like me and you&#x27;ve used every product out there, from the expensive designer lines on down, you are going to be delighted with how great Cetaphil is!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product on my toddler for years, and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>this she aways gets raches and has very very veryy sensetive skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I like the cleanser because it&#x27;s very GENTLE.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>very gentle and comfortabl</li>
            <li>Such price for pack two, it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and does not strip oils from your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another brand now and even though my skin does not feel as moisturized, it does not feel dry, and most importantly, it looks and feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>gentle clean the face and leave skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>When I use in the morning (when I don&#x27;t have make up on), it leaves my face soft and moisturized after cleaning (which is rare in all the cleansing products I&#x27;ve used), but my face does NOT feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>My skin became very sensitive to any new makeup, and I love makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped a lot with breakouts in a way that no other cleanser has been able to do for me.</li>
            <li>If, as in our very humid summer, my face fills to moist or greasy, i ether use a soft cloth with warm water and gently and lightly wipe my face then pat dry with a towl, or use mild toner before using moisterizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin that I have ever tried, including some of the more expensive high end cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li>When I wash off the Cetaphil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight, which is great, but I don&#x27;t know how well of a job it really does in cleaning my face because over the month that I used it, I noticed that my face broke out more often.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and prefer products that are aroma free and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>For a brand that is so widely know, I thought it might work SOME kind of wonders for my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>It literally makes your skin erupt at first and the dries EVERYTHING out.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :)     </li>
            <li>but it works really well somehow!  </li>
            <li>: I wash my face with water (once in the morning and night), gently rub Cetaphil all over my face, then rinse it off!</li>
            <li>This might be a fantastic cleanser for those with hyper sensitive skin</li>
            <li>i think the mildness actually makes it better because my redness has never flared up</li>
            <li>i tried washing again to be certain i was doing it right...</li>
            <li>I stopped using this after almost finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased it about 6 weeks ago and used it day and night for the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>In my 30&#x27;s now, and I am experiencing having acne for the first time.</li>
            <li>I do like it slightly more than the generic for some reason.</li>
            <li>If you like shaving in the shower (which I do not because I&#x27;ve never found a shower mirror that actually works), then that is even better, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Cetaphil!</li>
            <li>Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE FACIAL CLEANSER</li>
            <li>Anytime someone asks for a recommendation for a cleanser for babies, Cetaphil is my first suggestion.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this - and it&#x27;s exactly as it says...  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I used Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>my dermatologist and allergist referred me to this product its the only thing I will wash my face with love it</li>
            <li>A more recent study found higher levels of one paraben, n-propylparaben, in the axilla quadrant of the breast (the area nearest the underarm) [8].</li>
            <li>I occasionally get cystic acne (about one cyst every month) that has been the case for many years.</li>
            <li>We wash with Dawn dishsoap first if there are fleas then this</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this great in a long time, and that was only from two days of use!</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this whole line of skincare products!</li>
            <li>I find the BEST way to use it is simply to apply it and spread it all over the area you wish to cleanse(not just for the face but neck and Décolletage) and simply wipe it off with a bath facial towel.</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase more.</li>
            <li>A bonus is that I love it too for my facial wash.</li>
            <li>okay, i never had teen acne, not even in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I have purchased COUNTLESS products (mostly from Amazon because of the reviews) to treat the acne.</li>
            <li>Like Drake, y&#x27;all can Thank Me Later :)</li>
            <li>First off, I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>If you use Cetaphil products, you know that these two products look Exactly alike (except for the &amp;#34;Cleanser&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; on the bottles).  </li>
            <li>Even though I know better, I didn&#x27;t examine it well enough before opening it.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil helps combat bacteria that causes acne but does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my primary skin concern has turned from acne to preventing wrinkles (I am in my early 30s)</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you use this, use a makeup remover wipe first to remove water proof and eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Unlike many generics, the knockoff did not perform the same.</li>
            <li>So, was glad to have an alternate place to purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and finally am acne free!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for the two-pack and may last you a long time with varied use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>product will leave your face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This lotion is does not have any fragrance, which is nice, but it leaves the skin feeling superficially moisturized, wet like, just not a texture for the skin.</li>
            <li>During the wintertime, many of my family members suffer from red, cracked hands with eczema.</li>
            <li>I still have most of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and works very well!</li>
            <li>I have actually been able to go out without makeup.  </li>
            <li>Now three months later, my skin is truly looking luminous, more even-toned, and</li>
            <li>So, at most, I&#x27;m hitting the same area of skin with the mask 2 times per week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my nose is overall slightly more oily-looking that it used to be.  </li>
            <li>So, at most, I&#x27;m hitting the same area of skin with the mask 2 times per week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my nose is overall slightly more oily-looking that it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to properly moisturize immediately after washing your face.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this Cetaphil (cleanser) two years ago when they were on sale at BJ’s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on skin (hence the name) but strong enough to get it clean.</li>
            <li>You never know when you wont be able to use water, as I discovered when our water heater went out last week and the water had to be shut off to repair.  </li>
            <li>After menopause, I got pimples more than I ever had them as a teen.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin and since I started using it a little over a week ago, I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes.</li>
            <li>This product is unique in that the ONLY thing it does is clean your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is super gentle, as its name implies; non-foaming/soap-free (which is a huge plus in my book), and most importantly, it never irritates, aggravates or strips my combination, sensitive/reactive skin.</li>
            <li>I have had mild acne since I was in high school</li>
            <li>i tried a lot of cleansers , they were way too strong for my skin, so my dermatologist told me to use this one and so far it really works ....</li>
            <li>This is great especially during the winter months when skin gets dry.</li>
            <li>Super easy, can be used for a long time，Pump works well and consistently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had far more luck with a hand made goats milk soap and straight argan oil as a moisturizer, and I have highly acne prone</li>
            <li>that this isn&#x27;t the daily facial cleanser, which I think is a bit more potent, but this gentle skin cleanser will do the trick for the face.</li>
            <li>Their products are fantastic - I have pretty sensitive skin, and I swear by the gentle skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle, fragrance free and can be used directly on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from Noxema, to Clean and Clear, to Proactiv, to Aveeno, to Mary Kay, to Clinique.  </li>
            <li>I used Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Proactive, etc.</li>
            <li>I tried Whole Foods natural paraben free version of it, but it makes the skin around my mouth tingle which causes me some worry.  </li>
            <li>All i have been using and still do at times, is Neutrogena hydrating makeup remover cleansing towelettes, but they cost $6.00 for 25 pre-moistened toweletts , cetaphil works as well and makes my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>it made my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>but make skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive I can&#x27;t use anything to clean my face with.  </li>
            <li>This skin cleanser leaves yours hands clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this face cleaner for mornings early,  you don&#x27;t expat to clean your skin after all that makeup all day do you?</li>
            <li>/&gt;l use cetaphil as a shaving cream.it really works better then regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t get that super clean feeling like the regular because it doesn&#x27;t suds or lather.</li>
            <li>I actually credit this cleanser with much of my youthful appearance, because it has been a staple in my skin care regimen for so many consecutive years now that I cannot imagine it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The FDA is aware that estrogenic activity in the body is associated with certain forms of breast cancer, however, FD&amp;C Act does not authorize FDA to approve cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, I started using it when my daughter was born - she had baby eczema and needed a very soothing wash.  </li>
            <li>and so I really don&#x27;t need to wash my face very much anymore</li>
            <li>I really like thia product, but the gentle cleanser feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the normal one.</li>
            <li>If you have super sensitive skin, buy this!</li>
            <li>use coconut oil on a cotton pad first and that removes most of my makeup plus, moisturises my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I kept getting &#x27;bumps&#x27; that were pretty much under the skin.</li>
            <li>Which means you are pretty much just washing your face with water.</li>
            <li>As an older woman, I need a product that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>It provides exactly what the product describes - a gentle cleanse.</li>
            <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather (I use it with a Clarisonic) and does exactly what it says - gently cleans the skin without stripping it.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better than this in a long time.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it&#x27;s gentle for even the most sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m gonna keep looking for a natural alternative that won&#x27;t burn my skin.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Generic versions of this are just as good, and that is usually what I stick with if I don&#x27;t have a coupon.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and leaves my face feelings very clean, but not too dry.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is super sensitive</li>
            <li>just love it as it never stings or causes my skin to be dry.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>and I use the product after I workout to clean my open pores... at least that&#x27;s what I think it does lol), and I use it before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, so your skin won&#x27;t need to produce more oil and cause acne.</li>
            <li>I use Aquafor also for the most dry spots.</li>
            <li>After lots of research, I developed a routine that has improved my face and skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I start to slip into the dry skin territory, where I worry that I&#x27;ll break out more.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than I thought and does wonders for my dry</li>
            <li>Breast cancer is on the rise and besides the BRAC genes, nothing is 100% certain to cause breast cancer.</li>
            <li>it was a smart purchase</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so this stuff upped my sebum production by a large amount causing me to break out.</li>
            <li>downfall is that I don&#x27;t think it really cleans that great, but you have to sacrifice something in order not to dry the skin out that much, if I use it twice a day, after before work in the morning and after work in early evening(5-6pm), my face generally stays somewhat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for dry skin, rashes, sunburn - very gentle, more than baby wash.</li>
            <li>Because of the adjustment, I suggest getting a smaller bottle at first and making sure you can handle the NON-sudsing action.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend everyone try this product because it&#x27;s gentle, works well, and it easy to use (even easier than regular soap).</li>
            <li>For reference, I&#x27;m 40ish, have pretty normal skin that leans more towards oily than dry (def.</li>
            <li>Redness is much less a problem and my skin is so much more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I started using Cetaphil about ten years ago, and am still a loyal user to this day!  </li>
            <li>My acne is only mild, but started breaking out more recently-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal, and each bottle should last you a year, since its so large.</li>
            <li>Just as a note: I have very sensitive, normal to oily skin, with mild patches of papules on my forehead and above/in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I always have a really hard time finding a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil keeps my skin balanced and calm which I think has kept it clear.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil makes a soft and gentle product worth of the title it bestows.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much when I wash my face which I don&#x27;t really like, but in science I trust.  </li>
            <li>just happened to have a big pump bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleaner that was given to me by my mother who passes things on to me when they were free</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need anything in practical except quality</li>
            <li>No irritation, no scent, and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this product: it is not drying nor does it make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>I use it every night on my face and it gently cleans the makeup off</li>
            <li>and I just follow it with a gentle scrub with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Amazed that something so cheap could work such wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me a free sample of this after being diagnosed with facial eczema.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, too.</li>
            <li>This one was recommended by a dermatologist and I&#x27;m very grateful for the suggestion because it meets my desires in a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li>im really greatful that i have this an</li>
            <li>it is so gentle.                </li>
            <li>If you use dove soap on your face this works with as much gentleness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like have to rub around my eyes that much longer to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li>Very convenient</li>
            <li>but after that didn&#x27;t do much).</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone, its so gentle</li>
            <li>Because this product is truly gentle...</li>
            <li>so I need it to be gentle.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin really soft and fresh..</li>

            <li>my skin is tightening up and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>Then I repeat the whole process with a washcloth to get off every trace of makeup, rinse again, and follow with Cetaphil Cream at night and Lotion for day (</li>
            <li>Fast, fast shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for cleaning, Aquaphor for the flare ups, Eucerin Cream for the maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still loving this product and using the same face cleaning regiment listed above.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my face has recently become more sensitive</li>
            <li>is much more about the mechanical action of your hands/washcloth/brush than the actual cleanser.</li>
            <li>It soothes my skin (especially after I go on a pore-squeezing spree) and seems to keep it clear better than medicated formulas.</li>
            <li>Any kind of harsh product, anti-bacterial soap, etc., exacerbates my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>You could probably get it cheaper at the store if there is a good sale or some BOGO offer but those seem to be few and far between</li>
            <li>I dont have many allergies, and certainly not skin</li>
            <li>The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that one way doesn&#x27;t really seem to be better than the other, so it&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t use the Original formula, either - only the Gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I need without all the bells and whistles that comes with so many other cleansers on the market today.</li>
            <li>Based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, it seems that whether or not people like Cetaphil is extremely varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I see a significant difference in my skin overall.</li>
            <li>before bed with no sign of the peeling and rashes I get with&lt;br /&gt;all soaps and most other soap-alternatives.  </li>
            <li>(well this might due to the face is washed more often.)</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not pretty or fruity smelling, but it works.</li>
            <li>and I am noticing that it clogs my pores more than other brands of make-up.</li>
            <li>cleanser does nothing to clean my t-zone or remove daily make-up.</li>
            <li>Just a squirt is enough to clean your face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel clean when I use it as an alternate to soap.</li>
            <li>but i still do not feel it can wash my face clean enough!</li>
            <li>Afer washing my face with these cleansers, my face would feel clean but totally stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>but on the whole, I would much rather deal with a slightly oily nose than pimples on top of pimples.r nine months</li>
            <li>but on the whole, I would much rather deal with a slightly oily nose than pimples on top of pimples.</li>
            <li>In my younger days, i just slathered it on and wiped face clean with tissues.</li>
            <li>did (Neutrogena Deep Clean),</li>
            <li>can put it on your face then simply wipe it off with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist specifically wanted her to start using when she was 3yrs old, her skin immediately looked soft, healthy, not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you to buy them in grocery store, they are much cheaper there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin and it is not drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and after the wash the face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser is a fantastic gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser -</li>
            <li>I have tried other more expensive cleansers/soaps for sensitive skin, but this works the best for my sensitive skin/minor rosacea etc.</li>
            <li>This standard soap is super gentle.</li>
            <li>Also, there is no strong odor (who wants to smell something strong right on their face all day??)</li>
            <li>i have clear pretty skin</li>
            <li>I tried it first with water and it took off my makeup (had to use a bit of oil on the eye stuff), and my skin was awesomely soft and dewey feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is a bit too gentle on my face but it is a good cleanser for people with dry or sensitive skin because it does not irritate nor dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scentless, the texture is neither thick nor too thin, it is extremely Gentle while thoroughly cleaning the most sensitive or problematic skin (also great on wounded or irritated skin), does not overdry or leave your skin with any feeling except Clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Her initial reaction was that it was a little slimy, but after using it as I suggested, she agreed that it is a superior product and a bargain.  </li>
            <li>I put a quater size, sometimes a little more, on my face, gently rub/massage it in, often in circular motion, till it..not</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice cleanser that doesn&#x27;t smell nor leaves residue behind and yet leaves skin clean and not feeling dry.</li>
            <li>also follow up morning and night with acne medication my doctor prescribed, which he warned may dry out my skin and to follow up with an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not to sound like an advertisement or anything, but it made my skin smoother, softer, moisturized (since it was dry because of winter), and the majority of my acne is gone in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not that many ingredients and so many of it is questionable.  </li>
            <li>This particular formulation requires a water rinse.</li>
            <li>I am white, have skin a bit sensitive to light and redness.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a year now in combination with some topical acne medicine and my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li>I love cetaphil, its simple and basic, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Only recently did I start making a more proactive effort to rid myself of toxic chemicals, in my beauty products, as well as in cleaners for my house etc.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and soft and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have the daily facial cleanser and love it.</li>
            <li>This is the point I looked the above information up, and although I quoted Livestrong for information I found many instances and actual case</li>
            <li>This is the point I looked the above information up, and although I quoted Livestrong for information I found many instances and actual case</li>
            <li>A skincare regime is paramount for maintaining a youthful and vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>I followed using this with a mild simple brand toner and spot treatment....</li>
            <li>so I think this was a decent deal.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve gotten older (pushing 50)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and needed a gentle cleanser, this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I had planned on waiting a few weeks to give long term results but the incredible difference after only two days made me decide not to wait.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for newborns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash since high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, benzoyl peroxide and the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer twice daily for a month and the difference in my skin has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i tried nuetrogena, im highly allergic to garnier products</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware &amp;#34;Wallmarket&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Also I highly recommend the Cetaphil moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was in 5th grade, I&#x27;m now going into my senior year of high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning for my wedding and during this highly stressful time, I&#x27;ve had stress headaches, stress psoriasis and stress weight gain - but basically zero stress pimples.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning for my wedding and during this highly stressful time, I&#x27;ve had stress headaches, stress psoriasis and stress weight gain - but basically zero stress pimples.  </li>
            <li>they can irritate sensitive skin even more among other problems.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I recently bought Cetaphil because I have semi-sensitive skin but no acne, at first the product seemed amazing but after about 4 days it began to irritate my skin and leave dry itchy red patches on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used products from neutrogena, st ives, clearasil, clean and clear, and even different types of bar soap.  </li>
            <li>I tried popping, clean and clear (which worked before but suddenly couldn&#x27;t tackle the issue I was having) and astringent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of face washes from clean &amp; clear to proactive &amp; nothing has seemed to help.</li>
            <li>This product gets me clean, keeps my skin soft, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my 2 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle for sensitive skin and it even moisturizes for drier skin types.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not tear free so be careful around the face...</li>
            <li>It really works well on sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cetaphil is gentle on skin, including sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, gentle, and</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser that, while not specifically intended for babies, still provides soft suds that don&#x27;t hurt if they get in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>it takes a while to get used to it as it doesn&#x27;t leave your face with that stripped, dry feeling, but it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using Cetaphil as a shave gel with a simple, cheap two-blade razor with no moisture strip because my legs become very irritated by shaving in the winter, and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle and soft that i can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>most of which were far more expensive.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cleanser that will clean my skin without causing it to dry out</li>
            <li>Gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I use it just to do normal cleaning two or three times a day</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting the normal to oily but</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin for a long period and they look young and smooth when I apply it every day.</li>
            <li>the paraben absorbtion&#x27;s got to be pretty low as compared with a lotion for the whole body.</li>
            <li>I started using Cetaphil Gentle Skin around age 12, when I first began (properly) washing my face.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, buy the normal skin one.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I like the gentle wash much better than the daily wash it is less soapy and rinses much easier.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very gentle on skin and does not dry the skin.</li>
            <li>It is so mild and soft on my skin and it has helped my skin look younger and to feel softer.</li>
            <li>I had mild to moderate acne in my early 20&#x27;s - which was cleared up by using Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin ID system.  </li>
            <li>I love this gentle cleanser especially for my sunburnt skin which may feel some stinging when washed with other soap.</li>
            <li>I mean rose water, putting sandalwood powder, potato skins, lemon juice, masks, peels, all the &#x27;acids&#x27; that they sell on this site to fight the acne scars, pills, man</li>
            <li>I now have a bottle right next to every sink for hand washing purposes.</li>
            <li>I started using it while pregnant and have continued to use it long after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that this product has a pH of 7 which is just like water only with a little more benefits ;)</li>
            <li>This is the second time I buy it, it very useful for the person who live in CA , makes my skin not very dry</li>
            <li>I had scaly, grey skin on my elbows and hands and within a week of using the cream, the difference was huge, and after about 6 weeks, my elbows and hands are as soft as my 3-year old&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are kind of ambiguous, so I&#x27;ve used it two different ways where I wet my face first then apply or just apply it directly on my dry face.</li>
            <li>We are learning new things every day through research and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of the new water-rinse</li>
            <li>AND I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>Two years ago my new Dermatologist recommended all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>I have placed this on subscribe and save so that we can receive a new supply each month.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin with the occasional blemish (that&#x27;s fun as a 30 year old)</li>
            <li>Great for all skin types..cleans and rinses well, with no residue left behind.</li>
            <li>I have super dry sensative skin, But im a teenager</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m still hunting for an extra cleanser to deal with some of my nastier blackheads, this has cleared up 98% of my face (except for the aforementioned blackheads that enjoy lurking on my nose).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and feels itchy when I use soap.      </li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin ever since he was a baby.</li>
            <li>However, my skin was very sensitive for a while</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Your face will feel very soft and hydrated after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin becomes very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this is the only time i&#x27;ve ever bought a second bottle to continue usage (and these are pretty large!)</li>
            <li>But then right away, after rinsing, it left my skin feeling soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was becoming a big problem.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is a really great product and now my daily regimen is just so simple, wash my face in the morning and at night, no creams to put on after wards, no toners or serum, just wet, wash, rinse and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this before and many other items and have never had a single problem with Amazon until now.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were in a sealed plastic bag with the product label &amp;#34;Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2).&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young - start using this NOW!  </li>
            <li>It is a staple in my bathroom and even though I often get lured into buying a more expensive cleanser that promises better results, I always find myself going back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any more gentler than this and would not use other regular soaps.</li>
            <li>Any time we stray and try something more \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; such as California Baby , Toms, or even Aquaphor Baby, we are utterly unsatisfied and always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>it takes my makeup off well, it is sensitive for the eyes meaning it doesn&#x27;t burn them, and it has never made me break out!</li>
            <li>its not a waste of money!</li>
            <li>At first you will doubt on the effectiveness on this product as its very simple.</li>
            <li>please be aware that this cleanser does not totally remove all dirt and makeup from your skin.</li>
            <li>naturally I had 2 order it again!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my face red when I use it.</li>
            <li>I use this only if my face is really gross and has make up on it to get a clean feel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m finally getting such amazing results, and at such a low price!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin but realized a few years ago that sensitive products help keep my skin clear far better than products for oily skin.</li>
            <li>wash it off with warm water followed by cold water[to close the pores] and my face has never been so CLEAN and SOFT.</li>
            <li>The Gentle Cleanser has a very different consistancy and feel than the Normal Cetaphil Skin product.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about this product at first, but i figured what do I have to lose.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin that is prone to blemishes and mild acne.</li>
            <li>Switched back to water and aveeno positively radiant cleansing pads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was prescribed a generic version of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleaners for all skin types, with the exact same ingredients as Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers but have always returned to my tried and true, trusty Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>While the old formula was clear, the new is cloudy and thicker.</li>
            <li>half pump is more than sufficient for the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used numerous cleansers - the realization that I&#x27;ve come to is that less is more.</li>
            <li>My teenage son starting using it also, and says it helps with his mild acne.</li>
            <li>It contains some essential skin-friendly ingredients and a mild, non-irritating formula that contributes to a totally non-alkaline and fragrance-free product.</li>
            <li>I would have to double cleanse at night (using another different cleanser along with Cetaphil) because I am just super oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This not only kept my skin from being so dry it itched, it actually made it feel BETTER after washing it.  </li>
            <li>NO new breakouts, old ones are clearing up and not red, and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil, so far, has been the only brand of gentle skin cleanser that does not irritate our very sensitive skin or cause it to flare up and sting.</li>
            <li>Just a pure, simple cleanser.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, flaky skin that&#x27;s sensitive to everything else, try this right now.</li>
            <li>I wash the little bottle to keep it germ free.  </li>
            <li>My son has eczema and has not been able to tolerate regular baby body washes since he was little.</li>
            <li>Same classic product!</li>
            <li>But if your skin is oil to combination, I think it&#x27;s not a very strong product to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I used to use clearasil..clean and clear etc..</li>
            <li>and she said that cetaphil helped clear her skin of acne.</li>
            <li>my skin was completely clear.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clear my acne either.</li>
            <li>My complexion is consitently clear.</li>
            <li>An absolute must, especially for sensitive or combination skin.</li>
            <li>All I do day and night is wash with the Cetaphil cleanser and then put on my Rapid Clear moisturizer by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I switched to Cetaphil and my face was clear within a month.  </li>
            <li>helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It is now almost fully clear</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using this my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>,  my skin stays soft even though I have psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>It is also not heavy on fragrance -</li>
            <li>but so far, it&#x27;s done nothing.</li>
            <li>After going to my dermatologist in near tears, I begged for Accutane.  </li>
            <li>I am in my thirties, have adult acne with oily skin and have tried about every acne care product on the market.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a far cry from where I was a year ago when I was embarrassed to go out sometimes because of my breakouts.</li>
            <li>use this for our baby&#x27;s bath time too since he had baby acne and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is recommended for sensitive skin, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>Then I takea soft cloth and gently wipe most of the cream off, leaving a thin film to moisterize.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is 10 years old and she needs something to wash her face every night.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin, i have been suffering since middle school</li>
            <li>and I am 20 years old now.</li>
            <li>But if you have really sensitive skin, I would get this one.</li>
            <li>but this time I used it with my Clarisonic Mia as I was looking for a cleanser that was not harsh.</li>
            <li>I suppose, then, that it should come as no surprise that he suggested using Cetaphil as my daily face wash; its so gentle that you could lather it on and wipe it off with a towel instead of rinsing it off with water (if so inclined).    </li>
            <li>It is working for me so far...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, it didn&#x27;t help my break outs at all, it didn&#x27;t take make-up off very well.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have breakouts on my face anymore, just some scars from old pimples that are healing now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has also reduced the overall redness of my face, and is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it does not require a water rinse.</li>
            <li>but my skin can take alot not that sensitive  </li>
            <li>I still use it and for my toddler as it was recommended by his nurse early on.  </li>
            <li>If you want something for your baby&#x27;s hair, we use the Aquaphor Baby wash only on the hair and use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser for the rest of her body.  </li>
            <li>, not it has not dried out my skin.</li>
            <li>Actually I ordered Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2).</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin (isolated pimples rather than widespread breakouts).</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to remove eye makeup too.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Be sure not to confuse with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser...totally different, but deceivingly similarly looking on the shelf.</li>
            <li>She said this will not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They say this is gentle enough to use on a baby...</li>
            <li>Its soft and gives  a sense of cleanese.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve come to find it everywhere) and go all natural, but it makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Recommended by Vet for my old shitzu&#x27;s problematic skin allergies and sensitivities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s basic and affordable.  </li>
            <li>It irritated my skin so much I had to give up all facial products together!</li>
            <li>skin needs aka  for those with sensitive, acne, rosacea, or eczema skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser and the cream have made a complete difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>The cetaphil does not last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that peels, so I need something neutral like this to just remove dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>Trust me, this has been an ef&#x27;d up journey that has somewhat zapped me of my self-esteem and confidence and Cetaphil, thus far, has pulled through.</li>
            <li>I was surprised after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for around the and and lash area.</li>
            <li>The oxygen suppliers do not want oil or petroleum based products near the breathing tubes.</li>
            <li>Soft and thorough.</li>
            <li>Parabens also are estrogen-mimicking chemicals and may be a factor in the increasing prevalence of early puberty in girls and hormonal imbalances in boys.  </li>
            <li>Dirt and oils are the natural state of skin, which humans have lived with forever.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that limits my options for cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At 40 I developed oddly sensitive skin - not rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I finally tried Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li>11 year old started breaking out all over the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area of his face.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s now been using it for 3 or 4 days in a row and his face has completely cleared</li>
            <li>, issue of Toxicology published a study that shows when skin treated with creams that contain methylparaben was exposed to the sun&#x27;s UVB rays, the skin cells died and there was considerable oxidative stress on the skin&#x27;s tissue.</li>
            <li>for the first time in a long time i felt like my skin wasnt being stripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally tried Cetaphil, which is so gentle</li>
            <li>I am a busy nurse and allergic to alot of things.....</li>
            <li>I developed Rosacea a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>My sister had gotten a tiny bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser when she was in the hospital.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product imaginable including sticking my hands directly in a vaseline jar and then wearing gloves to bed because of my skin cracking and blistering during the colder months.</li>
            <li>This review is for the Cetaphil Gently Skin Cleanser and not the daily cleanser, I have not tried that product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the only thing that works with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have issues getting something that works well.</li>
            <li>Will probably try an organic soap or continue using Dove sensitive skin soap bar when needed.</li>
            <li>and it feels natural.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil was recommended to me by another young woman whose skin was perfection.</li>
            <li>but i still use this cetaphil for hand soap as it leaves my hands soft after a wash.</li>
            <li>I have suuuper sensitive skin and this has never given me a reaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but definitely does its job!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 21 or 22 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old.  </li>
            <li>my mom has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>My skin is horribly sensitive and for years I have been thinking it was also oily.</li>
            <li>SO FAR, my skin has improved drastically.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and there is no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 60 but started using this product in my early 30&#x27;s on the advice of a dermatologist I was working for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Cover Girl Lush Lash Mascara (never runs or causes raccoon eyes) for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>but I know it is sensitive</li>
            <li>Ok so maybe I was just growing out of adolescence, maybe this stuff helped wean me off of that commercial face cleanser b.s, OR this is a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seems this dried my skin out more than I could have possibly thought.</li>
            <li>High quality face cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin too much.</li>
            <li>I recently started Isotretinoin (Accutane), and this has been the only face wash I&#x27;ve been able to use without my skin getting a sharp prickling sensation.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not THAT sensitive, and you like a little bit of fragrance and that CLEAN feeling, try Basis Gel Cleanser (green tube) or Clean &amp; Clear Sensitive Cleanser (clear bottle with purple pump).</li>
            <li>burns a little, Idk why, but it made my face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>skin and eyes are extremely sensitive and can become dry, so I am very cautious when trying new products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and my skin is much less oily and my pores look much smaller after I use Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying it out for the past week (by itself so that I could see actual results), and so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>This product has actually become a staple for me (and now my husband) which is hard to believe, because I LOVE  trying new products.  </li>
            <li>You can use this as a daily cleanser for your face or to clean other areas in your body.</li>
            <li>Parabens are highly toxic to the body, especially for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days &amp; have already seen a major difference!</li>
            <li>It works harder than most cleansers and uses half the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I now have clear skin, but I have very soft skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to admit it, but I used to use plain soap to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li>After numerous dermatological visits on how to clear my occasional break outs, the one message repeated by my doctor was: be gentle to your face.  </li>
            <li>This small study does not prove a causal relationship between parabens and breast cancer, but it is important because it detected the presence of intact parabens--unaltered by the body&#x27;s metabolism--which is an indication of the chemical&#x27;s ability to penetrate skin and remain in breast tissue.</li>
            <li>But for general sensitive skin you might want to see if you even need it.</li>
            <li>so see such fast results, especially in the case of an 11 year old boy.</li>
            <li>first I was incredulous that something so widely used could cause me problems, but I stopped using it and the rash went</li>
            <li>massage it on my skin and eyes, then take a wet &amp; hot wash cloth and remove it all.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is back to normal -</li>
            <li>, it does not clean my face super well nor help with my acne.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of effort has improved my skin and turned me into a loyal fan of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I think I need to tweak my routine to calm that down,</li>
            <li>I think I need to tweak my routine to calm that down,</li>
            <li>, I opened the box and white oozing liquid started flooding onto my brand new levi jeans</li>
            <li>I have totally noticed that my skin looks and feels softer and I have less wrinkles as using both these products have removed old dead skin cells...revealing my soft new skin :)</li>
            <li>I bought this product in the hope that it would not dry out my face, clear my skin, and reduce the appearance of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling that you get by using a glycerin soap, which also leave your skin really feeling dry, probably &#x27;coz</li>
            <li>I really recommend it to anyone who is suffering dry</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too harsh but it definitely makes my face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>As promised, this cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this as an everyday, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>from \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; are the above listed, however, they are common in many products.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with rosacea several years ago, which means that not only is my skin super sensitive, but any sort of microbead/exfoliating substance is likely to cause me to break out and look as if I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for too long.</li>
            <li>I have been using this new formula for a few months now and it does not clean as well any more.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and/or rosacea!</li>
            <li>Just so you know I have very irritable skin and large pores, any new products (from makeup, lotions, soap, to facial treatments) usually clog those pores and break me out</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not over-dried (most of acne products over dry skins sooo badly that it causes actually more problems).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my face without water, but my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t even dry out.  </li>
            <li>My Mom who is very old had dry skin and when I told her about Cetaphil, she used it and was pleasantly surprised on how it well it cleansed and kept her skin moist.</li>
            <li>I tend to defer to most high end, expensive products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may take some time breaking away from such highly used carcinogens such as this</li>
            <li>By following a sugar free diet and taking my probiotics I can usually keep my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>I struggled for years with teen and adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised, especially since Cetaphil is supposedly recommended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li>About 3 years ago, when I was in my early 20&#x27;s, I was finally fed up with my decade plus terrors of getting cystic acne along my temples and jawline.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been only using it for a week now</li>
            <li>always thought my skin was a bit sensitive but there are different levels of sensitivity.</li>
            <li>use daily for soft skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years on my sensitive facial skin for thorough cleansing without backlash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used Cetaphil for two days, and so far, my face is noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>and I barely ever get pimples anymore.</li>
            <li>So i tried a lot of all natural facial cleansers that just sucked.</li>
            <li>A cleanser that not only suits all skin types but also works well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since starting using Cetaphil, my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has cleared up.</li>
            <li>Unlike traditional soaps, it won&#x27;t strip your skin of vital oils.  </li>
            <li>Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot</li>
            <li>Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the ultimate for at-home sensitive skin care.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only 35 years old.</li>
            <li>I will go back to using my old face wash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many kinds of face washes, but nothing actually cleared my skin without irritating it (my skin is extremely sensitive).</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but good enough for me to stop looking for anything different!</li>
            <li>I used to wake up with a fresh pimple everyday and haven&#x27;t since Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly to anyone with acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a generic brand from CVS and found it to be much more slimy and thick than the real thing and gave it away to a less scrutinizing customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I payed 18$ for a product only to not receive it properly and causing damage to another product(MY BRAND NEW LEVI JEANS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally haven&#x27;t really noticed this, but I think it&#x27;s because my skin&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li>After using various hand soaps to wash up, my hands would get very dry-so dry throughout the day, that they would get flaky and my skin would peel as if my hands were a surface composed of dandruff.</li>
            <li>cleanser has done what it is supposed to do for me, it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like my last cleanser</li>
            <li>one bottle will last you a lot longer compared to other cleansers however, be aware that there are SLS and parabens in this product.</li>
            <li>This mild skin cleanser is usually recommended by dermatologists to their patients with skin conditions, as it is non-comedogenic and has neutral pH formulations.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or tight feeling.</li>
            <li>This is so gentle and haven&#x27;t found any other product that worked as well for me.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight but extremely moisturizing, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle skin cleanser for those who have little to no acne.</li>
            <li>It really helps my face not to feel dry or drawn but actually moist like when I was younger.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin any further than it already is for those babies who need to have their heads washed daily to remove the oily buildup of cradle cap.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my face</li>
            <li>No dry skin</li>
            <li>My Mom uses Cetaphil as well, so not only have I found it to be effective but also somewhat nostalgic and sentimental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t react and is never dry or oily.</li>
            <li>I use this every single day and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, but dry skin.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have combination skin, a little bit of acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>gave it 4 out of 5 since it&#x27;s not extreme enough to remove face/eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And , for me at least, it takes off makeup and dirt and leaves my face filling clean, not tight and dry.</li>
            <li>Just massage onto DRY skin, then wipe off with washcloth and its all gone, plus my skin is soft and not irritated, never dry.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I was worry that it&#x27;s not clean enough</li>
            <li>Especially when its mimicking such a major hormone in my body.</li>
            <li>It is hard to open and then stops working when the bottle is still one-third full.  </li>
            <li>While we tried several other cleansers, this was the only one that really worked.  </li>
            <li>, I mean like the next day after using it once, my skin felt smoother and clean.</li>
            <li>a plain cleanser, no complicated ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with Dermatitis/Excema or other problem skin.</li>
            <li>Just goes to show that natural and gentle can work just as well as heavy duty treatments!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Use along with the bar soap for the bath to solve all your dry or sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>But I still need to use another lotion because I have really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My children and myself suffer from extremely sensitive (and dry) skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil facial cleanser because it works well for dry skin--the facial cleanser is for normal to oily.</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier looking, no new breakouts, old acne has healed up.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (got a few painful spots at first), but this is a sign of somthing good happening.</li>
            <li>and I was using proactiv for 5 years and finally decided to stop using it because although my skin was clear, it was also EXTREMELY dry</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but it had been developing dry patches recently.</li>
            <li>Using this in combination with &amp;#34;Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Cream&amp;#34; and Cerave moisturizer has completely eliminated the issues I was having previously.</li>
            <li>I recommend using this especially if you are looking for a product to use on: cuts, sores, sensitive areas, dry skin, children, elderly, acne, oily skin (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, but since I got pregnant, it&#x27;s been even worse.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and right away, i had some doubts because first of all, it was slimy, and second of all, it didn&#x27;t lather, so that was weird.</li>
            <li>My son is kissably soft now instead of dry and rashy!</li>
            <li>I will say that it&#x27;s not great on baby&#x27;s hair and that is fine because it&#x27;s made for the skin, not hair.</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry, sesative, mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I just figure, to really work the product should sit on my face a little.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it a little bit, but I just wipe my face a little more, even though you&#x27;re not really supposed to do that, with my cotton rounds (using spring water).</li>
            <li>I was not using any other new products</li>
            <li>Any dermatologist will tell you that expensive skin care products simply aren&#x27;t worth the money, and that&#x27;s certainly been my experience.</li>
            <li>it is just water bad chemicals which is not going to do your skin any good.</li>
            <li>good stuff bad price</li>

            <li> I love this cleanser!  </li>

            <li> Very good, the price is also cheaper With the help of a very good on the skin Future will consider use it all the time</li>
            <li> Their ultra hydrating lotion is also amazing.</li>
            <li> i bought it about a month ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, the price of the 2 items are the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels light.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and treated the blemishes with DDF 5% benzoyl peroxide which is an amazing product.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Another great thing I do with this cleanser is to add a teaspoon of baking soda and use it as an exfoliator, makes my skin smooth like nothing else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin</li>
            <li> Simply, it&#x27;s an effective cleanser that works well, even with my oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li> Effective product,</li>
            <li> but I have yet to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin cleaner that is good.</li>
            <li> it cleans, and effectively at that</li>
            <li> Nice product for kid with eczema.  </li>
            <li> but now its kind of like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I applaud this product for being nice about it (and not using sensationalist marketing).</li>
            <li> This was somewhat of a shock to me because I have always liked the feeling of face washes that tingle and take the oil off of my face, but now I realize that these were doing nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> best because it&#x27;s gentle and prevents me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I even tried makeing my own -_-&lt;br</li>
            <li> So gentle, cleanses effectively- great stuff!</li>
            <li> Their gentle skin cleanser and Restoraderm skin restoring moisturizer are the best.</li>
            <li> really nice feeling to my face</li>
            <li> It feels nice all the time.</li>
            <li> However, I do rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Nice to use as a cleanser for surgery patients who can&#x27;t get to a shower since you don&#x27;t have to have water to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like it as I have heard so many good things about it.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that it&#x27;s effective against acne.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, feels nice and clean lovesss it !</li>
            <li> Very good product。Emulsion texture, very gentle</li>

            <li> I have gotten more compliments than ever on my skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought this after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to get more of this stuff</li>
            <li> My organic mascara mostly smears under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is definitely much better than store brand equivalents.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so healthy.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both are allergic to most soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> excellent cleanser and about the only one without a fragrance</li>
            <li> It can do good work and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Get MOST of my makeup off..</li>
            <li> alot of the time I have to use more and more and rerinse my face to get all of my eye and face makeup off.  </li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> I have now found my magical combo</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be able to return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this product for many years to come.   </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re a Godsend! :)</li>
            <li> It is more like a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a germaphobe for many years</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for many years now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every night and every morning I take a shower, and I&#x27;m sure to use this every time I do.</li>
            <li> enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the CREAM for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this would be more focused to individuals with allergies or skin concerns.</li>
            <li> I do recommend a good moisturizer after using this, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I also love the pump and the size it comes in.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; salicylic acid cleansers, but I found they tend to irritate my skin and cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li> One bottle was okay</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and have always been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m treating acne and my face has looked better now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went and listened to what the lady said.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT&gt;</li>
            <li> Which means its up to use to make sure we check the ingredients list, something I didn&#x27;t think to do before.</li>
            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh my face feels after a good cleanse.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser !</li>
            <li> I feel in love with it.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for ever, its nothing fancy or snazzy , just simply the best, time tested,  and DR approved.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Better deal at COSTCO however at $15.95 for 2 20 OZ containers and it was with a $4 discount this month.</li>
            <li> If they decide to reformulate with something better, I might give it another go.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Gentle Skin Cleanser is a GREAT product that I cannot do without, so that&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if using a gentler product is better, then why use anything at all?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that this is the best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on the recommendation of friends who love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But for daily cleansing, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> , one more tip.</li>
            <li> it seems to be turning ok.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stand the oil face, so i wash my face many times a day.</li>
            <li> For so many years, I had used the anti-acne face washes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> you THINK you&#x27;re safe</li>
            <li> I figured liquid wash might be better.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I am really glad I found Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> I am sure my skin would be in better condition.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and found that this price is almost as if you are getting two for price of one.</li>
            <li> All Cetaphil products provided excellent skin care -- the soap, liquid cleanser, daily ultra hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a healthy cleanse.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> an additional tip when washing your face be sure to wash your hands with soap before you apply the cleanser to your skin or even touch your face.</li>
            <li> Well, to my surprise Cetaphil came out on top.  </li>
            <li> I have seen it at the doctors office many time but never thought about trying it.</li>
            <li> I love cetaphil, and I have a excelent experienc buying in Amazon</li>
            <li> I started using the avon clearskin brand I think in the gray bottle and m skin is doing so much better</li>
            <li> been so impressed with my skin after starting this product -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s softer, more luminous and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is not blemish-free, but it&#x27;s so much better than it used to be that I feel confident now without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also make sure to wash before and after my work-out.  </li>
            <li> I also make sure to wash before and after my work-out.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite stuff for washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> For the price the amount of product received is more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I would rather wait the 2-4 days to get in the mail rather than spend more money at a retail store.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!</li>
            <li> Love Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> I love it for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> What I will do is better help you understand what you will and will not get form this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Cetaphil, it was da</li>
            <li> I will use it till I find something better.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, but I&#x27;m sure they just recommend this to everyone regardless of their level of acne.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and love the gentleness of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You will love these products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just look better, it feels better, smoother,</li>
            <li> and it becomes a bit more oily.</li>
            <li> My favorite skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> That makes it perfect for places where you might not want to splash water (in a public bathroom maybe) on your face but would like to refresh your skin and then reapply your make</li>
            <li> Just perfect to clean my sensitive skin before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> great seller, highly recommend</li>
            <li> The cleanser is VERY mild and is perfect for daily bathing of my newborns.</li>
            <li> If you have super sensitive skin, as I do, this is the best product for you.</li>
            <li> Wash your face very clean, and there is no burden.</li>
            <li> Great for every everyone and skin types (from oily, to normal, to combination skin.)  </li>
            <li> I switched to this product after using Noxzema (which was good for the first month</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what exposed me to Cetaphil because I first used the product years ago, but I purchased it and LOVED that it retained moisture while I washed.</li>
            <li> pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is a genuinely good product that provides consistent results.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin, and this is wonderful for me.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff i used it the moment it got to me which was very quick.</li>
            <li> For itchy dry skin, eczema, I found the best lotions are Aveno and CeraVe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for ridding the face of oil and making the beard ready for a very close shave that does not disturb my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never been happy with my complexion (mostly blotchy redness).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of being the really nice, gentle but effective, transparent cleanser that it had been for years, what I got was a milky paste with no soap and no cleansing qualities whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the first time I am super happy with an Amazon.com purchase.</li>
            <li> Have tried many of the multiple facial cleansers and this does a great job and was a great price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle, removes make up wonderfully and makes  skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> which is very handy since I have a 10-month old son!    </li>
            <li> I love how it feels going on, and the fact that it has no scent is a HUGE plus for me.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great for sensitive and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works great on all skin types, mine being sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposedly great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil is great for those of us with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Great soap for sensitive hands</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made my skin more smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s cheap to begin with compared to many others.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and happy when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive, aging skin…</li>
            <li> This works great for sensitive skin in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out.</li>
            <li> Though it may not be as natural as I&#x27;d prefer, this product is still great for those wanting to transition from harsher, fragranced face washes.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always done a great job of keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews, I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything superior to it  for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to try since it is very affordable  and</li>
            <li> so I questioned it&#x27;s ability to clean my face but with a warm washcloth my face feels as clean as ever.  </li>
            <li> Very light and have to wash twice but does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> would getcha nice n right.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Price is awesome, comparing to the Price in other places.</li>
            <li> Very mild, but I do feel a difference from just using water.</li>
            <li> So soothing to skin that irritates easily.  </li>
            <li> The absolute best thing I&#x27;ve found for my recently sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It cleanses gently, easy to use around the eyes because it does not sting at all if you get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li> washes away easily.</li>
            <li> This Cetaphil cleans it off easily because it&#x27;s a gel-based mascara.</li>
            <li> As advertised, it is gentle, safe, and effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to see so many people having good luck with this, wish I were one of them.</li>
            <li> but you do not want something too strong on the skin.</li>
            <li> it is really good product for sensitive skin and also, it washes very clean</li>
            <li> Also, price is really good, better than those French drug store brands, love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m also acne prone, but this has been fine with that.  </li>
            <li> This is fine as a face lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will say that as a female who wears cosmetics sometimes its best to take off the eye makeup first before washing because this product doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Lucky me!  </li>
            <li> After getting so many comments on how great my skin looked, I took a good look in the mirror, and saw that the lines on my face from sunbathing so much (I don&#x27;t do that hardly at all any more), are so much better.  </li>
            <li> The container is particularly nice and easy to use, when I travel the lid is capable of locking and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product the shipping was just a little off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hands down !</li>
            <li> but it has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that Cetaphil has been a huge contributor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that Cetaphil has been a huge contributor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use water to wash it off if I&#x27;ve used sunscreen for the day, but otherwise I just wipe it off with a washcloth before applying a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle cleanser that works just as well as harsher benzyl containing products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Both are available on Amazon and have glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to the Cetaphil moisturizing lotion that I use daily.</li>
            <li> skin is smooth an silky.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely light</li>
            <li> Great for a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so much fun as foamy frothy soap, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice and gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> If a person has not used this cleanser they are missing the best.</li>
            <li> For those that enjoy putting sulfates and parabens on their face, go ahead and use this junk.  </li>
            <li> Also important it is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic and PH balanced.</li>
            <li> Scent free is the way to be, baby.</li>
            <li> What a great facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is ph balanced, gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This is because it contains an important humectant: propylene glycol that aids in improved hydration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, be worth buying, I like It, it made my face more smooth, clear, and beautify.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture with SPF during the day and St Ives Timeless Skin Moisturizer at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture with SPF during the day and St Ives Timeless Skin Moisturizer at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle, effective, and won&#x27;t strain your budget.</li>
            <li> (it does not clog your pores which is how pimples are formed) and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013ER62M Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment 2oz]]</li>
            <li> no break outs, and even heavy foundation goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> it is very confortable when using this item, the best facial cleaner</li>
            <li> Despite more costly products I&#x27;ve tried as samples, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has been my cleanser of choice for many years.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather makes me feel like I&#x27;m using too much because I keep pumping more and more</li>
            <li> but I always add miscellar toner after cetaphil to make sure skin is super clean.</li>
            <li> For those who are label conscious this is a good site to refer to; skindeep site, and the Environmental Working Group, as well as the one mentioned above.ed on to something organic, and I do not need to be concerned about harm to my body like with this product.</li>
            <li> But, it does a good job at cleansing early morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> pretty pretty good.</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see any good progress in terms of the number of breakouts disappearing, but whenever I use this it leaves a smooth feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and good smell.</li>
            <li> She likes this product because it&#x27;s good for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and removes makeup wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very calm and supple.</li>
            <li> Used several bottles of these cleanser, very good and like it very much.</li>
            <li> Just a natural, good, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t cleared it all up, I am more comfortable using this on his face and neck because it is a very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I now have 2 huge zits on my chin and my face never feels clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li> It serves one primary purpose - clean dirt and oil off your face.</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and allows for a smooth clean.</li>
            <li> Of course if it had the ingredients to make it lather, I&#x27;m sure it would probably dry out my face, so I&#x27;m actually glad that it doesn&#x27;t lather, kind of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the same Cetaphil for \\&quot;For Normal to Oily Skin\\&quot; does an excellent work!</li>
            <li> But for sensitive, oily skin, it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> I love this wash, its very gently on my skin and does not cause breakouts or clog my pores.</li>
            <li> super good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> sure how it does such a great job having sulfates, Galderma should really do something about that...</li>
            <li> I have tried store brands and they can&#x27;t beat the original Cetaphil brand.</li>
            <li> The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> it is fun not  to have  rashes!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> IT has been related to a snot consistency :P</li>
            <li> I was hooked after the first use and have since been totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES ME EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I also gave a bottle to a friend who was excited to start using it as well.</li>
            <li> product itself is very gentle, fragrance free, and the texture is like a light lotion that is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> The pediatrician recommended this which was not surprise since I use it too to clean my face.</li>
            <li> But as suspected, I can&#x27;t wash anything with this stuff to get it clean.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while and liked it because it cleaned my skin and most importantly left no residue.</li>
            <li> If you just want to keep your face clean (and avoid breaking out as a result)</li>
            <li> Add (organic) sugar and you have yourself a nice facial scrub :-)</li>
            <li> I like a clean feel after I&#x27;ve washed my face...</li>
            <li> Keeps him clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate his eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for 15 years and it is, by far, the best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing - getting your face clean</li>
            <li> and then another review said this stuff contains chemicals used to clean car engines.</li>
            <li> so i guess what im trying to say is if it contains ingrediants to clean car engines</li>
            <li> said that if you want your face perfectly clean you should do it at lease 60 seconds.]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are lots of great all natural face washes out there that are gentle on the skin without cancer causing agents like BHT, BHA, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> There are lots of great all natural face washes out there that are gentle on the skin without cancer causing agents like BHT, BHA, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> I used Forever Living&#x27;s aloe soap to clean my face</li>
            <li> Does anyone realize that SLS is used to clean car and truck engines?</li>
            <li> I can clean my eye make-up with ease, and no burning.</li>
            <li> My face is completely clear of acne so much more confident now because of this stuff</li>
            <li> It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> Paraben laced lotion is not going to clean your face.</li>
            <li> this product will not aggravate your skin, it will gently clean the pores which will overtime get rid of the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a decent product, just not that great for my skin and definitely not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> , my pores are very visible, not that smooth skin like most females have.</li>
            <li> For those who have sensitive skin and need a great moisturizer, especially if you are looking for a great anti-aging cream, in my travels through sensitive territory I found [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t burn, fragrance free, dye free, good for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> That one works good as that one, but the other one is more stronger.</li>
            <li> buy it here for the great price &amp; it&#x27;s always available which isn&#x27;t true of stores near where I live.</li>
            <li> It did nothing special for my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> although now I need special sunscreen from dermatologist as well).</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling nice and clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> I think this would be great for any type of skin, but if you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved this cleanser because it kept my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I need my skin to burn to feel it&#x27;s working or for the product to have some cool fragrance or some microbeads.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the bottle..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true my skin is oily, but after switching to cetaphil my skin cleared up.  </li>
            <li> If you too have sensitive skin, try the Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Tonic after cleansing for a nice treat.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid to remove dirt/debris and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> How cool is that?</li>
            <li> when I remembered Cetaphil and how it left that oily film on my face, I decided to give it a try, and surprisingly the combination worked.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how nicely it cleaned up my pores</li>
            <li> It is not painful when washing cracked hands with this product, and it seems to moisturize my hands well.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so gentle that you maybe be inclined to use more product that needed.</li>
            <li> And i feel it is really mild and make my skin clean .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this that I started using their whole line.  </li>
            <li> A facial cleanser that is very gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li> I had struggled finding the right cleanser to use for awhile--I mostly strayed towards all-natural products, like from Lush, because I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d be better for my face.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> It also has mostly healthy ingredients which has become very important to me recently.</li>
            <li> The best you can do is hold your face in a towel after gently cleansing your face with Cetaphil and listen to a little Stevie Nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> It is cheap and it lasts a very long time and most importantly, it cleans YOU FACE!</li>
            <li> and my skins looks and feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> your child has serious baby eczema, this is the best stuff on the planet for dealing with that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something mild to wash my face with.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and downgraded this cleanser to a hand wash so that I can quickly use it up.</li>
            <li> and it helped remove their cradle cap quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I want to swim in oceans with people who love me and whom I love back.  </li>
            <li> I have gone to many dermatologist for my acne, and taken many different medicines (both pill and creams)</li>
            <li> it quickly dries out the pimples i do get</li>
            <li> have been loyally using this for 10 years, and foolishly ignored the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> P Super time saving and non-messy(well not not splashy)</li>
            <li> and she prescribed me medication, but since I eventually got pregnant</li>
            <li> It also helped tremendously to reduce pimples</li>
            <li> I had mild acne and this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> That is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Honestly the acne isnt 100% gone; but it is 100% better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> its gently yet its effective enough to get all the dirt and grime off my face slaving away at work while my wife sits at home doing god knows what... but not cleaning for sure...</li>
            <li> However, this product is very consistent with what it says.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I break-out (more often than normal), so today I ordered a microdermabrasion brush that I am going to try using along with Cetaphil on the days I wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its dosent matter it was not much :P  ..</li>
            <li> The consistency of the wash is like a watered down lotion and it has no scent at all which is great of you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and washes off quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I need less moisturizer, and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> Great price (2 cost about $10 less than drugstore).</li>
            <li> I first tried it because it&#x27;s a beauty staple to so many people and so much is written on</li>
            <li> so when i finally ran out of mine... in attempt to save myself from the ridicule of wanting to but something for myself i decided to use hers which was this stuff and its pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years after a Canadian broadcaster I knew told me it was the secret to her beautiful skin along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is good since it won&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
            <li> Having struggled with acne for long periods of my life, I finally feel like I&#x27;ve found the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very gentle and keeps my skin clean.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really works !!</li>
            <li> But after using it just once, and for the first time in almost a year, I am not suffering!  </li>
            <li> Just simple and mild yet effective.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and many people said this cleanser is mild and non additive.</li>
            <li> It has been less then a week and already my husband and I are so impressed with how fresh and clear my face looks.</li>
            <li> Here are the pros: gentle, non-irritating, fragrance free, won&#x27;t burn even on inflamed skin.    </li>
            <li> but, I really miss a light scent.....</li>
            <li> But, for a child was eczema, it&#x27;s a great everyday cleanser.  </li>
            <li> feels real gentle</li>
            <li> Gentle, fragrance free, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> and I love how my skin feels; it is so soft.  </li>
            <li> My 1 yr old skin was better in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I bath my son using Cetaphil (which is kind of expensive baby wash) but having a happy baby with no itchy skin is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and it&#x27;s especially good for long winter in Michigan.</li>
            <li> Is this ok for a 10 year old?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in the process of finding my perfect rosacea skin care routine, but to think that Cetaphil alone, a simple, gentle face wash, has almost cleared up my rosacea is pretty cool, and encouraging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The old formula is better.</li>
            <li> This is the region in which the highest proportion of breast tumors are found, although paraben concentration in the tissue samples was not related to location of breast tumors in individual women.\\&quot; More good info and applicable citations can be found on this site: safecosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i get ridiculed if i try to buy my own facial wash</li>
            <li> I have noticed that using some kind of moisturizer after cleansing is necessary for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have discovered this and that now it is shipped directly to my door on an automated schedule.</li>
            <li> it is appropriate to my sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> After hearing such good reviews about Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li> It does the job of cleaning and refreshing my face, and it is not harmful to my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> main reasons I chose this product are because it&#x27;s cheap, easy to find, and gentle.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for any skin type but especially for those of us who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Rarely have I borken out while using this product.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> In fact, you can even use it as a shaving gel (even better for sensitive skin than comercial shaving gel)..</li>
            <li> but I started putting on Cetaphil fresh out of the shower and it has improved the my skin&#x27;s texture, complexion, and restored moisture to it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser, and it&#x27;s simple and so effective.</li>
            <li> however mines is way more sensitive.</li>
            <li> fresh feeling&lt;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gotten even more sensitive including Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> An old favorite.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price for the name brand product for us.</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect , I have oily skin and most soaps for oily let skin so dry , this one removes the grease but dont leave my skin dry, on the contrary, it leaves very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and this cleanser is gentle but also effective enough to leave my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> SUPER GENTLE!</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I can tolerate mild fragrance and mild soaps so after trying this, I realized I don&#x27;t need something this gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes you skin feel smooth, clean, and soft.  </li>
            <li> By the way, because it is soap-free and has ingredients that are non-irritating, it is also good for cleansing eczematous skin and other rashes.</li>
            <li> My face still feels like it needs to be washed again right after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> 2pack....prided right......</li>
            <li> I use this right before I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Price is right, don&#x27;t need water, it works.</li>
            <li> The Cetaphil certainly is gentle on my face, but because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like my face is completely clean.</li>
            <li> Gentle formula helps keep skin clean without drying it out or causing oiliness.</li>
            <li> It is also very versatile, because you can rinse it off with water, with or without a face cloth, or just wipe it off with a clean cloth or tissue.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle on skin and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> And it can clean my face very well.</li>
            <li> thing to note is that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam, if you absolutely need the foam to feel clean this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensible skin and I use Cetaphil every day to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and tends to produce breakouts easily</li>
            <li> B001ET76GW Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], which I do recommend highly.    </li>
            <li> not dry), though i think this would actually probably be great for someone with skin a bit oilier than mine (which sounds counterintuitive, I know -</li>
            <li> I DO NOT use this product to remove makeup, I use sensitive baby wipes to remove makeup, then follow up with this product to clean out my pores and clean off any makeup that I missed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so finding a good cleanser that does not dry out my skin or give me hives from scent added is an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product so far and look forward to continued positive results to my face and body.</li>
            <li> The cetaphil lotion is the answer-it is very soothing and cool.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely good for such price with such two huge cleansers.</li>
            <li> I want to live freely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it rinses off easily and completely, leaving no residue at all (unlike filmy soaps or lotions).</li>
            <li> This is a great gentle but effective product, actually recommended by my dermatologist who sells more expensive things.  </li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I finally found a wash that finally cures my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleans my face nicely without stripping the dry zones, and leaves my skin dewy but not oily.  </li>
            <li> It is very mild and leaves your skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> A better cleanser for me was the Clean and Clear sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, perhaps foloowing the cleansing with a swab of a gentle toner / mild astringent</li>
            <li> Each time I try a more natural one it is very watery and dries your skin out.</li>
            <li> and I felt as though it was not give me a strong enough clean feeling to continue use.</li>
            <li> I love using this face wash, it makes my face feel clean without that overly dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> For those who are label conscious this is a good site to refer to; skindeep site, and the Environmental Working Group, as well as the one mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle and does not irritate the eye.</li>
            <li> Anything with harsh ingredients ends up drying out my skin, causing it to compensate by oiling up even more, leading to more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to expect: This product is very mild as it is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Two days of washing my face with this and following up with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry/Sensitive Skin and my 34 yr old skin now looks almost as good as it did when I was 24.</li>
            <li> Someone&#x27;s opinion I regarded more highly then others since she&#x27;s very conscious of what she puts in her body.</li>
            <li> Shame, I really wanted this product to work because of all the great reviews it has here, but my skin got used to the harsh cleansers first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really remember when it first happened, but man am I super pumped I did.  </li>
            <li> - if you are like me and you&#x27;ve used every product out there, from the expensive designer lines on down, you are going to be delighted with how great Cetaphil is!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product on my toddler for years, and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> this she aways gets raches and has very very veryy sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser because it&#x27;s very GENTLE.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> very gentle and comfortabl</li>
            <li> Such price for pack two, it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and does not strip oils from your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand now and even though my skin does not feel as moisturized, it does not feel dry, and most importantly, it looks and feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> gentle clean the face and leave skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> When I use in the morning (when I don&#x27;t have make up on), it leaves my face soft and moisturized after cleaning (which is rare in all the cleansing products I&#x27;ve used), but my face does NOT feel clean at all.</li>
            <li> My skin became very sensitive to any new makeup, and I love makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped a lot with breakouts in a way that no other cleanser has been able to do for me.</li>
            <li> If, as in our very humid summer, my face fills to moist or greasy, i ether use a soft cloth with warm water and gently and lightly wipe my face then pat dry with a towl, or use mild toner before using moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin that I have ever tried, including some of the more expensive high end cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li> When I wash off the Cetaphil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight, which is great, but I don&#x27;t know how well of a job it really does in cleaning my face because over the month that I used it, I noticed that my face broke out more often.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and prefer products that are aroma free and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> For a brand that is so widely know, I thought it might work SOME kind of wonders for my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> It literally makes your skin erupt at first and the dries EVERYTHING out.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :)     </li>
            <li> but it works really well somehow!  </li>
            <li> : I wash my face with water (once in the morning and night), gently rub Cetaphil all over my face, then rinse it off!</li>
            <li> This might be a fantastic cleanser for those with hyper sensitive skin</li>
            <li> i think the mildness actually makes it better because my redness has never flared up</li>
            <li> i tried washing again to be certain i was doing it right...</li>
            <li> I stopped using this after almost finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased it about 6 weeks ago and used it day and night for the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> In my 30&#x27;s now, and I am experiencing having acne for the first time.</li>
            <li> I do like it slightly more than the generic for some reason.</li>
            <li> If you like shaving in the shower (which I do not because I&#x27;ve never found a shower mirror that actually works), then that is even better, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FACIAL CLEANSER</li>
            <li> Anytime someone asks for a recommendation for a cleanser for babies, Cetaphil is my first suggestion.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this - and it&#x27;s exactly as it says...  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I used Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> my dermatologist and allergist referred me to this product its the only thing I will wash my face with love it</li>
            <li> A more recent study found higher levels of one paraben, n-propylparaben, in the axilla quadrant of the breast (the area nearest the underarm) [8].</li>
            <li> I occasionally get cystic acne (about one cyst every month) that has been the case for many years.</li>
            <li> We wash with Dawn dishsoap first if there are fleas then this</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this great in a long time, and that was only from two days of use!</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this whole line of skincare products!</li>
            <li> I find the BEST way to use it is simply to apply it and spread it all over the area you wish to cleanse(not just for the face but neck and Décolletage) and simply wipe it off with a bath facial towel.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase more.</li>
            <li> A bonus is that I love it too for my facial wash.</li>
            <li> okay, i never had teen acne, not even in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I have purchased COUNTLESS products (mostly from Amazon because of the reviews) to treat the acne.</li>
            <li> Like Drake, y&#x27;all can Thank Me Later :)</li>
            <li> First off, I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> If you use Cetaphil products, you know that these two products look Exactly alike (except for the &amp;#34;Cleanser&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; on the bottles).  </li>
            <li> Even though I know better, I didn&#x27;t examine it well enough before opening it.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil helps combat bacteria that causes acne but does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my primary skin concern has turned from acne to preventing wrinkles (I am in my early 30s)</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you use this, use a makeup remover wipe first to remove water proof and eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Unlike many generics, the knockoff did not perform the same.</li>
            <li> So, was glad to have an alternate place to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and finally am acne free!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for the two-pack and may last you a long time with varied use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> product will leave your face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This lotion is does not have any fragrance, which is nice, but it leaves the skin feeling superficially moisturized, wet like, just not a texture for the skin.</li>
            <li> During the wintertime, many of my family members suffer from red, cracked hands with eczema.</li>
            <li> I still have most of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and works very well!</li>
            <li> I have actually been able to go out without makeup.  </li>
            <li> Now three months later, my skin is truly looking luminous, more even-toned, and</li>
            <li> So, at most, I&#x27;m hitting the same area of skin with the mask 2 times per week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my nose is overall slightly more oily-looking that it used to be.  </li>
            <li> So, at most, I&#x27;m hitting the same area of skin with the mask 2 times per week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my nose is overall slightly more oily-looking that it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to properly moisturize immediately after washing your face.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this Cetaphil (cleanser) two years ago when they were on sale at BJ’s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on skin (hence the name) but strong enough to get it clean.</li>
            <li> You never know when you wont be able to use water, as I discovered when our water heater went out last week and the water had to be shut off to repair.  </li>
            <li> After menopause, I got pimples more than I ever had them as a teen.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin and since I started using it a little over a week ago, I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product is unique in that the ONLY thing it does is clean your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is super gentle, as its name implies; non-foaming/soap-free (which is a huge plus in my book), and most importantly, it never irritates, aggravates or strips my combination, sensitive/reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne since I was in high school</li>
            <li> i tried a lot of cleansers , they were way too strong for my skin, so my dermatologist told me to use this one and so far it really works ....</li>
            <li> This is great especially during the winter months when skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> Super easy, can be used for a long time，Pump works well and consistently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far more luck with a hand made goats milk soap and straight argan oil as a moisturizer, and I have highly acne prone</li>
            <li> that this isn&#x27;t the daily facial cleanser, which I think is a bit more potent, but this gentle skin cleanser will do the trick for the face.</li>
            <li> Their products are fantastic - I have pretty sensitive skin, and I swear by the gentle skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle, fragrance free and can be used directly on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from Noxema, to Clean and Clear, to Proactiv, to Aveeno, to Mary Kay, to Clinique.  </li>
            <li> I used Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Proactive, etc.</li>
            <li> I tried Whole Foods natural paraben free version of it, but it makes the skin around my mouth tingle which causes me some worry.  </li>
            <li> All i have been using and still do at times, is Neutrogena hydrating makeup remover cleansing towelettes, but they cost $6.00 for 25 pre-moistened toweletts , cetaphil works as well and makes my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> but make skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive I can&#x27;t use anything to clean my face with.  </li>
            <li> This skin cleanser leaves yours hands clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this face cleaner for mornings early,  you don&#x27;t expat to clean your skin after all that makeup all day do you?</li>
            <li> /&gt;l use cetaphil as a shaving cream.it really works better then regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t get that super clean feeling like the regular because it doesn&#x27;t suds or lather.</li>
            <li> I actually credit this cleanser with much of my youthful appearance, because it has been a staple in my skin care regimen for so many consecutive years now that I cannot imagine it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The FDA is aware that estrogenic activity in the body is associated with certain forms of breast cancer, however, FD&amp;C Act does not authorize FDA to approve cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, I started using it when my daughter was born - she had baby eczema and needed a very soothing wash.  </li>
            <li> and so I really don&#x27;t need to wash my face very much anymore</li>
            <li> I really like thia product, but the gentle cleanser feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the normal one.</li>
            <li> If you have super sensitive skin, buy this!</li>
            <li> use coconut oil on a cotton pad first and that removes most of my makeup plus, moisturises my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I kept getting &#x27;bumps&#x27; that were pretty much under the skin.</li>
            <li> Which means you are pretty much just washing your face with water.</li>
            <li> As an older woman, I need a product that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> It provides exactly what the product describes - a gentle cleanse.</li>
            <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather (I use it with a Clarisonic) and does exactly what it says - gently cleans the skin without stripping it.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better than this in a long time.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it&#x27;s gentle for even the most sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m gonna keep looking for a natural alternative that won&#x27;t burn my skin.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Generic versions of this are just as good, and that is usually what I stick with if I don&#x27;t have a coupon.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and leaves my face feelings very clean, but not too dry.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is super sensitive</li>
            <li> just love it as it never stings or causes my skin to be dry.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> and I use the product after I workout to clean my open pores... at least that&#x27;s what I think it does lol), and I use it before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, so your skin won&#x27;t need to produce more oil and cause acne.</li>
            <li> I use Aquafor also for the most dry spots.</li>
            <li> After lots of research, I developed a routine that has improved my face and skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I start to slip into the dry skin territory, where I worry that I&#x27;ll break out more.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than I thought and does wonders for my dry</li>
            <li> Breast cancer is on the rise and besides the BRAC genes, nothing is 100% certain to cause breast cancer.</li>
            <li> it was a smart purchase</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so this stuff upped my sebum production by a large amount causing me to break out.</li>
            <li> downfall is that I don&#x27;t think it really cleans that great, but you have to sacrifice something in order not to dry the skin out that much, if I use it twice a day, after before work in the morning and after work in early evening(5-6pm), my face generally stays somewhat</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for dry skin, rashes, sunburn - very gentle, more than baby wash.</li>
            <li> Because of the adjustment, I suggest getting a smaller bottle at first and making sure you can handle the NON-sudsing action.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend everyone try this product because it&#x27;s gentle, works well, and it easy to use (even easier than regular soap).</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m 40ish, have pretty normal skin that leans more towards oily than dry (def.</li>
            <li> Redness is much less a problem and my skin is so much more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I started using Cetaphil about ten years ago, and am still a loyal user to this day!  </li>
            <li> My acne is only mild, but started breaking out more recently-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal, and each bottle should last you a year, since its so large.</li>
            <li> Just as a note: I have very sensitive, normal to oily skin, with mild patches of papules on my forehead and above/in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so I always have a really hard time finding a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Cetaphil keeps my skin balanced and calm which I think has kept it clear.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil makes a soft and gentle product worth of the title it bestows.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much when I wash my face which I don&#x27;t really like, but in science I trust.  </li>
            <li> just happened to have a big pump bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleaner that was given to me by my mother who passes things on to me when they were free</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need anything in practical except quality</li>
            <li> No irritation, no scent, and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this product: it is not drying nor does it make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> I use it every night on my face and it gently cleans the makeup off</li>
            <li> and I just follow it with a gentle scrub with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Amazed that something so cheap could work such wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a free sample of this after being diagnosed with facial eczema.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, too.</li>
            <li> This one was recommended by a dermatologist and I&#x27;m very grateful for the suggestion because it meets my desires in a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li> im really greatful that i have this an</li>
            <li> it is so gentle.                </li>
            <li> If you use dove soap on your face this works with as much gentleness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like have to rub around my eyes that much longer to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li> Very convenient</li>
            <li> but after that didn&#x27;t do much).</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone, its so gentle</li>
            <li> Because this product is truly gentle...</li>
            <li> so I need it to be gentle.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin really soft and fresh..</li>
            <li> I like that it has no scent and is gentle.</li>
            <li> In some reason Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser \\&quot;FOR</li>
            <li> They handle it very well too.  </li>

            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really know what to do.</li>

            <li> I have used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for about 10 years....</li>
            <li> iv used this product before, i have always had very problematic skin</li>

            <li> It is gentle and non-drying.</li>
            <li> way too gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought this Cetaphil gentle cleanser 4 weeks ago and my acne ....</li>
            <li> i like the fact that cetaphil is a gentle non-soap cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser as directed by my dermatologist for years.</li>

            <li> I use this product with my Clarisonic Plus system and I really like it.  </li>

            <li> Stick with the real McCoy.</li>
            <li> I think the face wash I was using (which contained salycilic acid) was just too much for my skin to take</li>

            <li> Kinda feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a really watery lotion on your face with the lack of lather.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle enough for me to use twice a day and effective enough to control my acne.</li>
            <li> As a guy, skincare hasn&#x27;t been much of a priority and anything besides water was never required.</li>
            <li> For a very oily and acne-prone skin I have tried a lot of cleansers</li>

            <li> Formula 3 (Oily Skin) Mask once per week on my whole face</li>

            <li> It does the job gently and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> First, I want to point out that Cetaphil makes two cleanser this one and another, which is for “ Normal to oily skin”.</li>
            <li> It cleans makeup brushes very well .&lt;br</li>
            <li> ** Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> **eup brushes very well .&lt;br</li>
            <li> ** Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> It really works well for both of us.</li>
            <li> After months of agony I finally found an article that recommended contacting a chemist or pharmacist to find a 100% soap and fragrance free soap alternative.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> my skin is tightening up and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle.  </li>
            <li> Then I repeat the whole process with a washcloth to get off every trace of makeup, rinse again, and follow with Cetaphil Cream at night and Lotion for day (</li>

            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for cleaning, Aquaphor for the flare ups, Eucerin Cream for the maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still loving this product and using the same face cleaning regiment listed above.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my face has recently become more sensitive</li>
            <li> is much more about the mechanical action of your hands/washcloth/brush than the actual cleanser.</li>
            <li> It soothes my skin (especially after I go on a pore-squeezing spree) and seems to keep it clear better than medicated formulas.</li>
            <li> Any kind of harsh product, anti-bacterial soap, etc., exacerbates my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> You could probably get it cheaper at the store if there is a good sale or some BOGO offer but those seem to be few and far between</li>
            <li> I dont have many allergies, and certainly not skin</li>
            <li> The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that one way doesn&#x27;t really seem to be better than the other, so it&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t use the Original formula, either - only the Gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I need without all the bells and whistles that comes with so many other cleansers on the market today.</li>
            <li> Based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, it seems that whether or not people like Cetaphil is extremely varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I see a significant difference in my skin overall.</li>
            <li> before bed with no sign of the peeling and rashes I get with&lt;br /&gt;all soaps and most other soap-alternatives.  </li>
            <li> (well this might due to the face is washed more often.)</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not pretty or fruity smelling, but it works.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing that it clogs my pores more than other brands of make-up.</li>
            <li> cleanser does nothing to clean my t-zone or remove daily make-up.</li>
            <li> Just a squirt is enough to clean your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel clean when I use it as an alternate to soap.</li>
            <li> but i still do not feel it can wash my face clean enough!</li>
            <li> Afer washing my face with these cleansers, my face would feel clean but totally stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> but on the whole, I would much rather deal with a slightly oily nose than pimples on top of pimples.r nine months</li>
            <li> but on the whole, I would much rather deal with a slightly oily nose than pimples on top of pimples.</li>
            <li> In my younger days, i just slathered it on and wiped face clean with tissues.</li>
            <li> did (Neutrogena Deep Clean),</li>
            <li> can put it on your face then simply wipe it off with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist specifically wanted her to start using when she was 3yrs old, her skin immediately looked soft, healthy, not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you to buy them in grocery store, they are much cheaper there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin and it is not drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and after the wash the face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser is a fantastic gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser -</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive cleansers/soaps for sensitive skin, but this works the best for my sensitive skin/minor rosacea etc.</li>
            <li> This standard soap is super gentle.</li>
            <li> Also, there is no strong odor (who wants to smell something strong right on their face all day??)</li>
            <li> i have clear pretty skin</li>
            <li> I tried it first with water and it took off my makeup (had to use a bit of oil on the eye stuff), and my skin was awesomely soft and dewey feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is a bit too gentle on my face but it is a good cleanser for people with dry or sensitive skin because it does not irritate nor dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scentless, the texture is neither thick nor too thin, it is extremely Gentle while thoroughly cleaning the most sensitive or problematic skin (also great on wounded or irritated skin), does not overdry or leave your skin with any feeling except Clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Her initial reaction was that it was a little slimy, but after using it as I suggested, she agreed that it is a superior product and a bargain.  </li>
            <li> I put a quater size, sometimes a little more, on my face, gently rub/massage it in, often in circular motion, till it..not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cleanser that doesn&#x27;t smell nor leaves residue behind and yet leaves skin clean and not feeling dry.</li>
            <li> also follow up morning and night with acne medication my doctor prescribed, which he warned may dry out my skin and to follow up with an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not to sound like an advertisement or anything, but it made my skin smoother, softer, moisturized (since it was dry because of winter), and the majority of my acne is gone in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not that many ingredients and so many of it is questionable.  </li>
            <li> This particular formulation requires a water rinse.</li>
            <li> I am white, have skin a bit sensitive to light and redness.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a year now in combination with some topical acne medicine and my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love cetaphil, its simple and basic, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Only recently did I start making a more proactive effort to rid myself of toxic chemicals, in my beauty products, as well as in cleaners for my house etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and soft and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have the daily facial cleanser and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the point I looked the above information up, and although I quoted Livestrong for information I found many instances and actual case</li>
            <li> This is the point I looked the above information up, and although I quoted Livestrong for information I found many instances and actual case</li>
            <li> A skincare regime is paramount for maintaining a youthful and vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> I followed using this with a mild simple brand toner and spot treatment....</li>
            <li> so I think this was a decent deal.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve gotten older (pushing 50)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and needed a gentle cleanser, this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I had planned on waiting a few weeks to give long term results but the incredible difference after only two days made me decide not to wait.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for newborns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash since high school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, benzoyl peroxide and the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer twice daily for a month and the difference in my skin has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i tried nuetrogena, im highly allergic to garnier products</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware &amp;#34;Wallmarket&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Also I highly recommend the Cetaphil moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was in 5th grade, I&#x27;m now going into my senior year of high school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning for my wedding and during this highly stressful time, I&#x27;ve had stress headaches, stress psoriasis and stress weight gain - but basically zero stress pimples.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning for my wedding and during this highly stressful time, I&#x27;ve had stress headaches, stress psoriasis and stress weight gain - but basically zero stress pimples.  </li>
            <li> they can irritate sensitive skin even more among other problems.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I recently bought Cetaphil because I have semi-sensitive skin but no acne, at first the product seemed amazing but after about 4 days it began to irritate my skin and leave dry itchy red patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used products from neutrogena, st ives, clearasil, clean and clear, and even different types of bar soap.  </li>
            <li> I tried popping, clean and clear (which worked before but suddenly couldn&#x27;t tackle the issue I was having) and astringent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of face washes from clean &amp; clear to proactive &amp; nothing has seemed to help.</li>
            <li> This product gets me clean, keeps my skin soft, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my 2 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle for sensitive skin and it even moisturizes for drier skin types.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not tear free so be careful around the face...</li>
            <li> It really works well on sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cetaphil is gentle on skin, including sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, gentle, and</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that, while not specifically intended for babies, still provides soft suds that don&#x27;t hurt if they get in the eyes.  </li>
            <li> it takes a while to get used to it as it doesn&#x27;t leave your face with that stripped, dry feeling, but it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using Cetaphil as a shave gel with a simple, cheap two-blade razor with no moisture strip because my legs become very irritated by shaving in the winter, and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle and soft that i can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> most of which were far more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleanser that will clean my skin without causing it to dry out</li>
            <li> Gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I use it just to do normal cleaning two or three times a day</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the normal to oily but</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin for a long period and they look young and smooth when I apply it every day.</li>
            <li> the paraben absorbtion&#x27;s got to be pretty low as compared with a lotion for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I started using Cetaphil Gentle Skin around age 12, when I first began (properly) washing my face.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, buy the normal skin one.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the gentle wash much better than the daily wash it is less soapy and rinses much easier.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very gentle on skin and does not dry the skin.</li>
            <li> It is so mild and soft on my skin and it has helped my skin look younger and to feel softer.</li>
            <li> I had mild to moderate acne in my early 20&#x27;s - which was cleared up by using Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin ID system.  </li>
            <li> I love this gentle cleanser especially for my sunburnt skin which may feel some stinging when washed with other soap.</li>
            <li> I mean rose water, putting sandalwood powder, potato skins, lemon juice, masks, peels, all the &#x27;acids&#x27; that they sell on this site to fight the acne scars, pills, man</li>
            <li> I now have a bottle right next to every sink for hand washing purposes.</li>
            <li> I started using it while pregnant and have continued to use it long after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that this product has a pH of 7 which is just like water only with a little more benefits ;)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy it, it very useful for the person who live in CA , makes my skin not very dry</li>
            <li> I had scaly, grey skin on my elbows and hands and within a week of using the cream, the difference was huge, and after about 6 weeks, my elbows and hands are as soft as my 3-year old&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are kind of ambiguous, so I&#x27;ve used it two different ways where I wet my face first then apply or just apply it directly on my dry face.</li>
            <li> We are learning new things every day through research and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of the new water-rinse</li>
            <li> AND I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> Two years ago my new Dermatologist recommended all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> I have placed this on subscribe and save so that we can receive a new supply each month.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with the occasional blemish (that&#x27;s fun as a 30 year old)</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types..cleans and rinses well, with no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I have super dry sensative skin, But im a teenager</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still hunting for an extra cleanser to deal with some of my nastier blackheads, this has cleared up 98% of my face (except for the aforementioned blackheads that enjoy lurking on my nose).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and feels itchy when I use soap.      </li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin ever since he was a baby.</li>
            <li> However, my skin was very sensitive for a while</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Your face will feel very soft and hydrated after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is the only time i&#x27;ve ever bought a second bottle to continue usage (and these are pretty large!)</li>
            <li> But then right away, after rinsing, it left my skin feeling soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was becoming a big problem.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a really great product and now my daily regimen is just so simple, wash my face in the morning and at night, no creams to put on after wards, no toners or serum, just wet, wash, rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and many other items and have never had a single problem with Amazon until now.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were in a sealed plastic bag with the product label &amp;#34;Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2).&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young - start using this NOW!  </li>
            <li> It is a staple in my bathroom and even though I often get lured into buying a more expensive cleanser that promises better results, I always find myself going back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any more gentler than this and would not use other regular soaps.</li>
            <li> Any time we stray and try something more \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; such as California Baby , Toms, or even Aquaphor Baby, we are utterly unsatisfied and always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> it takes my makeup off well, it is sensitive for the eyes meaning it doesn&#x27;t burn them, and it has never made me break out!</li>
            <li> its not a waste of money!</li>
            <li> At first you will doubt on the effectiveness on this product as its very simple.</li>
            <li> please be aware that this cleanser does not totally remove all dirt and makeup from your skin.</li>
            <li> naturally I had 2 order it again!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my face red when I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this only if my face is really gross and has make up on it to get a clean feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m finally getting such amazing results, and at such a low price!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but realized a few years ago that sensitive products help keep my skin clear far better than products for oily skin.</li>
            <li> wash it off with warm water followed by cold water[to close the pores] and my face has never been so CLEAN and SOFT.</li>
            <li> The Gentle Cleanser has a very different consistancy and feel than the Normal Cetaphil Skin product.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this product at first, but i figured what do I have to lose.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin that is prone to blemishes and mild acne.</li>
            <li> Switched back to water and aveeno positively radiant cleansing pads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was prescribed a generic version of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleaners for all skin types, with the exact same ingredients as Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers but have always returned to my tried and true, trusty Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> While the old formula was clear, the new is cloudy and thicker.</li>
            <li> half pump is more than sufficient for the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used numerous cleansers - the realization that I&#x27;ve come to is that less is more.</li>
            <li> My teenage son starting using it also, and says it helps with his mild acne.</li>
            <li> It contains some essential skin-friendly ingredients and a mild, non-irritating formula that contributes to a totally non-alkaline and fragrance-free product.</li>
            <li> I would have to double cleanse at night (using another different cleanser along with Cetaphil) because I am just super oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This not only kept my skin from being so dry it itched, it actually made it feel BETTER after washing it.  </li>
            <li> NO new breakouts, old ones are clearing up and not red, and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil, so far, has been the only brand of gentle skin cleanser that does not irritate our very sensitive skin or cause it to flare up and sting.</li>
            <li> Just a pure, simple cleanser.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, flaky skin that&#x27;s sensitive to everything else, try this right now.</li>
            <li> I wash the little bottle to keep it germ free.  </li>
            <li> My son has eczema and has not been able to tolerate regular baby body washes since he was little.</li>
            <li> Same classic product!</li>
            <li> But if your skin is oil to combination, I think it&#x27;s not a very strong product to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I used to use clearasil..clean and clear etc..</li>
            <li> and she said that cetaphil helped clear her skin of acne.</li>
            <li> my skin was completely clear.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t clear my acne either.</li>
            <li> My complexion is consitently clear.</li>
            <li> An absolute must, especially for sensitive or combination skin.</li>
            <li> All I do day and night is wash with the Cetaphil cleanser and then put on my Rapid Clear moisturizer by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I switched to Cetaphil and my face was clear within a month.  </li>
            <li> helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It is now almost fully clear</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> ,  my skin stays soft even though I have psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> It is also not heavy on fragrance -</li>
            <li> but so far, it&#x27;s done nothing.</li>
            <li> After going to my dermatologist in near tears, I begged for Accutane.  </li>
            <li> I am in my thirties, have adult acne with oily skin and have tried about every acne care product on the market.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a far cry from where I was a year ago when I was embarrassed to go out sometimes because of my breakouts.</li>
            <li> use this for our baby&#x27;s bath time too since he had baby acne and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is recommended for sensitive skin, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Then I takea soft cloth and gently wipe most of the cream off, leaving a thin film to moisterize.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 10 years old and she needs something to wash her face every night.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin, i have been suffering since middle school</li>
            <li> and I am 20 years old now.</li>
            <li> But if you have really sensitive skin, I would get this one.</li>
            <li> but this time I used it with my Clarisonic Mia as I was looking for a cleanser that was not harsh.</li>
            <li> I suppose, then, that it should come as no surprise that he suggested using Cetaphil as my daily face wash; its so gentle that you could lather it on and wipe it off with a towel instead of rinsing it off with water (if so inclined).    </li>
            <li> It is working for me so far...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, it didn&#x27;t help my break outs at all, it didn&#x27;t take make-up off very well.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have breakouts on my face anymore, just some scars from old pimples that are healing now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has also reduced the overall redness of my face, and is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it does not require a water rinse.</li>
            <li> but my skin can take alot not that sensitive  </li>
            <li> I still use it and for my toddler as it was recommended by his nurse early on.  </li>
            <li> If you want something for your baby&#x27;s hair, we use the Aquaphor Baby wash only on the hair and use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser for the rest of her body.  </li>
            <li> , not it has not dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Actually I ordered Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2).</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin (isolated pimples rather than widespread breakouts).</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to remove eye makeup too.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> Be sure not to confuse with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser...totally different, but deceivingly similarly looking on the shelf.</li>
            <li> She said this will not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They say this is gentle enough to use on a baby...</li>
            <li> Its soft and gives  a sense of cleanese.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve come to find it everywhere) and go all natural, but it makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Vet for my old shitzu&#x27;s problematic skin allergies and sensitivities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s basic and affordable.  </li>
            <li> It irritated my skin so much I had to give up all facial products together!</li>
            <li> skin needs aka  for those with sensitive, acne, rosacea, or eczema skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser and the cream have made a complete difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> The cetaphil does not last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that peels, so I need something neutral like this to just remove dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> Trust me, this has been an ef&#x27;d up journey that has somewhat zapped me of my self-esteem and confidence and Cetaphil, thus far, has pulled through.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for around the and and lash area.</li>
            <li> The oxygen suppliers do not want oil or petroleum based products near the breathing tubes.</li>
            <li> Soft and thorough.</li>
            <li> Parabens also are estrogen-mimicking chemicals and may be a factor in the increasing prevalence of early puberty in girls and hormonal imbalances in boys.  </li>
            <li> Dirt and oils are the natural state of skin, which humans have lived with forever.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that limits my options for cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At 40 I developed oddly sensitive skin - not rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li> 11 year old started breaking out all over the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area of his face.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s now been using it for 3 or 4 days in a row and his face has completely cleared</li>
            <li> , issue of Toxicology published a study that shows when skin treated with creams that contain methylparaben was exposed to the sun&#x27;s UVB rays, the skin cells died and there was considerable oxidative stress on the skin&#x27;s tissue.</li>
            <li> for the first time in a long time i felt like my skin wasnt being stripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally tried Cetaphil, which is so gentle</li>
            <li> I am a busy nurse and allergic to alot of things.....</li>
            <li> I developed Rosacea a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> My sister had gotten a tiny bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser when she was in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product imaginable including sticking my hands directly in a vaseline jar and then wearing gloves to bed because of my skin cracking and blistering during the colder months.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Cetaphil Gently Skin Cleanser and not the daily cleanser, I have not tried that product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the only thing that works with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have issues getting something that works well.</li>
            <li> Will probably try an organic soap or continue using Dove sensitive skin soap bar when needed.</li>
            <li> and it feels natural.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil was recommended to me by another young woman whose skin was perfection.</li>
            <li> but i still use this cetaphil for hand soap as it leaves my hands soft after a wash.</li>
            <li> I have suuuper sensitive skin and this has never given me a reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but definitely does its job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 21 or 22 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old.  </li>
            <li> my mom has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> My skin is horribly sensitive and for years I have been thinking it was also oily.</li>
            <li> SO FAR, my skin has improved drastically.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and there is no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 60 but started using this product in my early 30&#x27;s on the advice of a dermatologist I was working for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Cover Girl Lush Lash Mascara (never runs or causes raccoon eyes) for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> but I know it is sensitive</li>
            <li> Ok so maybe I was just growing out of adolescence, maybe this stuff helped wean me off of that commercial face cleanser b.s, OR this is a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it seems this dried my skin out more than I could have possibly thought.</li>
            <li> High quality face cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin too much.</li>
            <li> I recently started Isotretinoin (Accutane), and this has been the only face wash I&#x27;ve been able to use without my skin getting a sharp prickling sensation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not THAT sensitive, and you like a little bit of fragrance and that CLEAN feeling, try Basis Gel Cleanser (green tube) or Clean &amp; Clear Sensitive Cleanser (clear bottle with purple pump).</li>
            <li> burns a little, Idk why, but it made my face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> skin and eyes are extremely sensitive and can become dry, so I am very cautious when trying new products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and my skin is much less oily and my pores look much smaller after I use Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it out for the past week (by itself so that I could see actual results), and so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> This product has actually become a staple for me (and now my husband) which is hard to believe, because I LOVE  trying new products.  </li>
            <li> You can use this as a daily cleanser for your face or to clean other areas in your body.</li>
            <li> Parabens are highly toxic to the body, especially for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days &amp; have already seen a major difference!</li>
            <li> It works harder than most cleansers and uses half the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I now have clear skin, but I have very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to admit it, but I used to use plain soap to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li> After numerous dermatological visits on how to clear my occasional break outs, the one message repeated by my doctor was: be gentle to your face.  </li>
            <li> This small study does not prove a causal relationship between parabens and breast cancer, but it is important because it detected the presence of intact parabens--unaltered by the body&#x27;s metabolism--which is an indication of the chemical&#x27;s ability to penetrate skin and remain in breast tissue.</li>
            <li> But for general sensitive skin you might want to see if you even need it.</li>
            <li> so see such fast results, especially in the case of an 11 year old boy.</li>
            <li> first I was incredulous that something so widely used could cause me problems, but I stopped using it and the rash went</li>
            <li> massage it on my skin and eyes, then take a wet &amp; hot wash cloth and remove it all.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is back to normal -</li>
            <li> , it does not clean my face super well nor help with my acne.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of effort has improved my skin and turned me into a loyal fan of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I think I need to tweak my routine to calm that down,</li>
            <li> I think I need to tweak my routine to calm that down,</li>
            <li> , I opened the box and white oozing liquid started flooding onto my brand new levi jeans</li>
            <li> I have totally noticed that my skin looks and feels softer and I have less wrinkles as using both these products have removed old dead skin cells...revealing my soft new skin :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hope that it would not dry out my face, clear my skin, and reduce the appearance of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling that you get by using a glycerin soap, which also leave your skin really feeling dry, probably &#x27;coz</li>
            <li> I really recommend it to anyone who is suffering dry</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too harsh but it definitely makes my face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> As promised, this cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this as an everyday, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> from \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; are the above listed, however, they are common in many products.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea several years ago, which means that not only is my skin super sensitive, but any sort of microbead/exfoliating substance is likely to cause me to break out and look as if I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for too long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new formula for a few months now and it does not clean as well any more.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and/or rosacea!</li>
            <li> Just so you know I have very irritable skin and large pores, any new products (from makeup, lotions, soap, to facial treatments) usually clog those pores and break me out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not over-dried (most of acne products over dry skins sooo badly that it causes actually more problems).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my face without water, but my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t even dry out.  </li>
            <li> My Mom who is very old had dry skin and when I told her about Cetaphil, she used it and was pleasantly surprised on how it well it cleansed and kept her skin moist.</li>
            <li> I tend to defer to most high end, expensive products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may take some time breaking away from such highly used carcinogens such as this</li>
            <li> By following a sugar free diet and taking my probiotics I can usually keep my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> I struggled for years with teen and adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised, especially since Cetaphil is supposedly recommended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago, when I was in my early 20&#x27;s, I was finally fed up with my decade plus terrors of getting cystic acne along my temples and jawline.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been only using it for a week now</li>
            <li> always thought my skin was a bit sensitive but there are different levels of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> use daily for soft skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years on my sensitive facial skin for thorough cleansing without backlash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Cetaphil for two days, and so far, my face is noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> and I barely ever get pimples anymore.</li>
            <li> So i tried a lot of all natural facial cleansers that just sucked.</li>
            <li> A cleanser that not only suits all skin types but also works well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Since starting using Cetaphil, my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has cleared up.</li>
            <li> Unlike traditional soaps, it won&#x27;t strip your skin of vital oils.  </li>
            <li> Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot</li>
            <li> Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the ultimate for at-home sensitive skin care.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only 35 years old.</li>
            <li> I will go back to using my old face wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many kinds of face washes, but nothing actually cleared my skin without irritating it (my skin is extremely sensitive).</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but good enough for me to stop looking for anything different!</li>
            <li> I used to wake up with a fresh pimple everyday and haven&#x27;t since Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly to anyone with acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a generic brand from CVS and found it to be much more slimy and thick than the real thing and gave it away to a less scrutinizing customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I payed 18$ for a product only to not receive it properly and causing damage to another product(MY BRAND NEW LEVI JEANS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t really noticed this, but I think it&#x27;s because my skin&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> After using various hand soaps to wash up, my hands would get very dry-so dry throughout the day, that they would get flaky and my skin would peel as if my hands were a surface composed of dandruff.</li>
            <li> cleanser has done what it is supposed to do for me, it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like my last cleanser</li>
            <li> one bottle will last you a lot longer compared to other cleansers however, be aware that there are SLS and parabens in this product.</li>
            <li> This mild skin cleanser is usually recommended by dermatologists to their patients with skin conditions, as it is non-comedogenic and has neutral pH formulations.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or tight feeling.</li>
            <li> This is so gentle and haven&#x27;t found any other product that worked as well for me.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight but extremely moisturizing, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle skin cleanser for those who have little to no acne.</li>
            <li> It really helps my face not to feel dry or drawn but actually moist like when I was younger.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin any further than it already is for those babies who need to have their heads washed daily to remove the oily buildup of cradle cap.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my face</li>
            <li> No dry skin</li>
            <li> My Mom uses Cetaphil as well, so not only have I found it to be effective but also somewhat nostalgic and sentimental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t react and is never dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, but dry skin.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have combination skin, a little bit of acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 out of 5 since it&#x27;s not extreme enough to remove face/eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And , for me at least, it takes off makeup and dirt and leaves my face filling clean, not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Just massage onto DRY skin, then wipe off with washcloth and its all gone, plus my skin is soft and not irritated, never dry.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I was worry that it&#x27;s not clean enough</li>
            <li> Especially when its mimicking such a major hormone in my body.</li>
            <li> It is hard to open and then stops working when the bottle is still one-third full.  </li>
            <li> While we tried several other cleansers, this was the only one that really worked.  </li>
            <li> , I mean like the next day after using it once, my skin felt smoother and clean.</li>
            <li> a plain cleanser, no complicated ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with Dermatitis/Excema or other problem skin.</li>
            <li> Just goes to show that natural and gentle can work just as well as heavy duty treatments!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Use along with the bar soap for the bath to solve all your dry or sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> But I still need to use another lotion because I have really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My children and myself suffer from extremely sensitive (and dry) skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil facial cleanser because it works well for dry skin--the facial cleanser is for normal to oily.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier looking, no new breakouts, old acne has healed up.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (got a few painful spots at first), but this is a sign of somthing good happening.</li>
            <li> and I was using proactiv for 5 years and finally decided to stop using it because although my skin was clear, it was also EXTREMELY dry</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but it had been developing dry patches recently.</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with &amp;#34;Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Cream&amp;#34; and Cerave moisturizer has completely eliminated the issues I was having previously.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this especially if you are looking for a product to use on: cuts, sores, sensitive areas, dry skin, children, elderly, acne, oily skin (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, but since I got pregnant, it&#x27;s been even worse.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and right away, i had some doubts because first of all, it was slimy, and second of all, it didn&#x27;t lather, so that was weird.</li>
            <li> My son is kissably soft now instead of dry and rashy!</li>
            <li> I will say that it&#x27;s not great on baby&#x27;s hair and that is fine because it&#x27;s made for the skin, not hair.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, sesative, mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I just figure, to really work the product should sit on my face a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it a little bit, but I just wipe my face a little more, even though you&#x27;re not really supposed to do that, with my cotton rounds (using spring water).</li>
            <li> I was not using any other new products</li>
            <li> Any dermatologist will tell you that expensive skin care products simply aren&#x27;t worth the money, and that&#x27;s certainly been my experience.</li>
            <li> it is just water bad chemicals which is not going to do your skin any good.</li>
            <li> good stuff bad price</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing high end skin products (mostly Dermalogica and Yonka) but after searching for less expensive products to replace them, I discovered this line by Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I never feel dried out or tight after using this on my face and my face still feels clean.</li>
            <li> The third time I cleaned my skin with this I immediately put on moisturizer because the first two times is dried out to the point it created dry scabs on my face</li>
            <li> Though I live in New York City, it is often difficult to find the Gentle Skin product in my local drugstores</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this regimen along with this cleanser to anyone experiencing adult acne due to makeup/ hormones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for sensitive skin (like Simple and St. Ives)</li>
            <li> I recently decided to ditch all of the face wash products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid because I no longer have much acne and these products always left my face feeling overly dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Just a feeling left behind like your face is one hundred percent clean.</li>
            <li> purchased this due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In my early 20&#x27;s my face broke out horribly due to birth control.</li>
            <li> because your doctor reccomends, doesn&#x27;t mean it is right for you.</li>
            <li> One of the twins has dry skin, the other is normal.</li>
            <li> Her usually appears around the ankles and flares up with certain foods.</li>
            <li> I have realllyyy sensitive skin and this definitely didn&#x27;t burn, make my face red, and dry out my skin, like other cleansers did.</li>
            <li> I was use to the hard abrasive cleansers that really scrubbed your skin and left your face red after you washed it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can only imagine what heavy fragrance can do to newborns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser in the past and never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> But I put the product on an exfoliating spin brush (just your basic one) and scrub my face (gently) for at least a minute, then I wash the rest of my body and rinse the product off as the very last step.</li>
            <li> A bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been playing with make-up again, and whilst rummaging through the linen closet for something, I spied a jug of Cetaphil I&#x27;ve had for who knows how long.</li>
            <li> but if i rub it into my face for long enough it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went this long with regular soap.</li>
            <li> This product always leaves our little girl so silky soft !  </li>
            <li> I get suckered into trying other more expensive options and always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> After months of breaking out and causing me new cystic acne everyday after my workouts I bought this .</li>
            <li> It felt like everyday, new acne appeared on my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to be dry, so I have to be very careful about what I use as cleansers and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I find that some of the acne specific washes really dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face for at least 30 years, and my face looks about 15-20 years younger than I really am.  </li>
            <li> I have t-zone oiliness, but dry skin (especially in winter) elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Different baby washes would cause dry skin, rashes and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Only Cetaphil works for the dry skin baby.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin especially at the T-zone.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and my skin was starting to get dry and look \\&quot;old\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has not helped my dry skin (also a recent</li>
            <li> On a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, I used to wash my face with products that include 10% benzoyl peroxide to deal with breakouts but that just left my skin irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> Anyway overall this product worked wonders for me and it helps with my dry hands and arms.</li>
            <li> I buy the bar soap for when I shower, their facial moisterizer and their cream for extrememly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great at removing makeup, but most cleansers that can take off your makeup without a washcloth tend to be harsh.</li>
            <li> reaction confused my dermatologist tremendously as he recommends cetaphil to his patients with allergies.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t open the bottle/pump (and the second bottle remains shrink-wrapped), but I pretty much knew it was too late to return it, which is unfortunate since I don&#x27;t use this lotion and am on an extremely tight budget and purchased the Cleanser only because I Really Needed</li>
            <li> They also increase the expression of genes usually regulated by estradiol (a natural form of estrogen); these genes cause human breast cancer cells to grow and multiply in cellular studies.\\&quot; Byford JR, Shaw LE, Drew MGB, Pope GS, Sauer MJ, Darbre PD (2002).</li>
            <li> Its kind of expensive, but the bottle lasts forever, since you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> So I bough the big bottle of this cleanser and in four days there were less breakouts (I had 2-3 new spots per day, which were definitely due to hormonal changes-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really low cost and even the more expensive brands I have used still don&#x27;t work as well as cetaphil!</li>
            <li> The only possible con would be the ingredients: it includes parabens, but a lot of products use it as a preservative and it&#x27;s a slight amount compared to the amount needed to actually pose harm.</li>
            <li> I have acne, but my face becomes very dry with the air, so I was looking for a facial cleanser that might help even out my erratic skin.</li>
            <li> use it 2x daily, and other than some minor drying (not overall, just drying out my acne)</li>
            <li> say don&#x27;t bother buying expensive face washes--put your money towards a really quality moisturizer instead--and stick with this classic cleanser.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead are so much lighter and the lines at the corner of my eyes are hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get into why these chemicals are bad for us here, please take a moment to research those to form your own opinion.</li>
            <li> saw things on TV and magazines, and had my own money to buy these things and my skin got so bad.</li>
            <li> Our 11 month old and myself have dealt with different type eczema the past year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled a bit with acne in my late teens, early 20s, and it turned out that the problem was that I was using much too harsh of products that were exacerbating the problem.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to worry about showering everyday now since my skin stays soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 9 years old now and uses it everyday to wash her face.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for this product to help get rid of my blemishes all at once.</li>
            <li> and it stopped my itching after long pool sessions.</li>
            <li> so long, cetaphil.</li>
            <li> any* harsh ingredients to aggravate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I spent about $16 for 2 of these and got $10 off by applying for the Amazon.com store card, which made the total purchase about $6.</li>
            <li> I wish I started using it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> The bottle also lasts a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this product has been around a long time and it&#x27;s also recommended by dermatologists.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive face wash and lotion and exfoliating products and everything I&#x27;ve tried has made me break out, or didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> This is probably worse than Eucerin&#x27;s calming skin cream since it is used in the shower where the hot water opens up the pores in the skins and thus expedites topical absorption of paraben into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this winter was especially harsh and my skin was flaky and red for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the tight feeling I used to get from other facial cleansers, but instead leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Although it is not antibacterial, it is gentle on the face and it is less messy for me to use at work as opposed to the bar soap which would have to be stored in a container, melt etc....</li>
            <li> complain that it leaves a film on your face, but if you READ the back of the bottle, they say to wipe off the product just enough so that there&#x27;s a slight film on your face.</li>
            <li> The teens involved in the study lived in different parts of the country and included white, black, Asian-American, and multiethnic girls.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and occasionally prone to break-outs, particularly if not cleansed thoroughly.</li>
            <li> And I now use Cetaphil in conjunction with a Clarisonic (delicate skin brush), since Cetaphil&#x27;s only negative is that it has absolutely no exfoliating capability whatsoever, and I think exfoliation is really important for aging skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and recently I had lots of breakouts due to changing my pills.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been skipping around different facial cleansers for the past 10 or so years, just getting a different brand every time i ran out.  </li>
            <li> Due to personal preference, I won&#x27;t continue to use this product because of the *ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, my doctor recommended this soap as I was having some skin problems (mainly due to tons of exercise and sweating etc).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, he gave me a prescription gel at the same time and indeed, the issue cleared up.</li>
            <li> then I did extreme research on facial washing.</li>
            <li> I went back to using cetaphil cleanser which I used when I was teenager due to over drying acne products.</li>
            <li> Every other product has made my skin red, dry or both.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my dry skin and than rinse it off with water.  </li>
            <li> I apply it onto my dry face, rub it all over, including the eyelids, then rinse it off and pat my face dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years now because of my really dry skin</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin or irritate it.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry out if I use it.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use any moisturizer because my skin hasn&#x27;t been dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> As a woman of 61 I&#x27;ve been having, since menopause, extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> For me, whike in the shower, I use my soap, whether it be a bar or liquid, and then apply the Cetaphil, let it remain on my skin for a minute or so, rinse off and pay dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin or clog pores.  </li>
            <li> the dry temperatures here make my skin feel dry too.</li>
            <li> My skin will feel dry about halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> Will not over dry skin.</li>
            <li> Apply to dry skin and rinse off.</li>
            <li> It calmed my skin, didn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> I used everything from Neutrogena to L&#x27;Oreal and it either made me too greasy, dry, or didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excessively dry skin and eczema runs in my family.</li>
            <li> My doc recommended it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels elastic after I dry my face off, and I&#x27;ve had fewer</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> Was a lifesaver when I lived in the Colorado dry weather</li>
            <li> and I start to slip into the dry skin territory, where I worry that I&#x27;ll break out more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After you dry with a face towel, you will feel the difference on your skin.</li>
            <li> Oil is gone without you face feeling stretch dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Like lots of acne sufferers, I have combination skin, which means I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, itchy skin...but can get a break out here and there in hotter months.</li>
            <li> My skin feels cleaner and softer after every use, and I have chronically dry skin.</li>
            <li> Two days ago the skin on my face was so dry and flaky I couldn&#x27;t use makeup and was embarrassed to have people get too close to my face.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it provides gentle cleansing without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> At least for normal and dry skin</li>
            <li> I tried Clinique and other brands intended to calm the skin with no effect - or they made it worse.  </li>
            <li> My family has noticed that their hands are significantly less red and dry</li>
            <li> The only down side is, this product came damage to my house.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me a 16 oz bottle last three months; my routine is to use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products I can use on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take my parabens over irritated, dry skin any day !  </li>
            <li> The pimple&#x27;s much smaller and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, I had slightly fewer pimples and my skin tone was starting to even out.  </li>
            <li> This product contains three dangerous parabens strongly linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> literally bought ~150$ worth of dermatology products because they were rated so high, but they ended up irritating my face and making my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I use a salicylic acid serum at night which does its job but leaves my skin very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> , at the very least I am certain it is not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was harsh &amp; left my skin extremely dry with years of repeated use.</li>
            <li> does not neccessarily have to be rinsed off with water, non irritating, for very sensitive skin, use it sinceabout 8 years daily.</li>
            <li> My routine may be a little different than others though.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and I have had hardly any pimples since using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a very common irritant, and I developed itching and rashes from it after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Nothing great, nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on the skin, which is a must because my skin is crazy sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you want to take care of your face, this is a product to use early in the morning and late at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my products and routines for anyone else who&#x27;s struggling with big, hormonal pimples in their mid to late 20&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my products and routines for anyone else who&#x27;s struggling with big, hormonal pimples in their mid to late 20&#x27;s:  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with the eczema and there is absolutely no foam whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of spending so much money every month.</li>
            <li> As expected, I broke out like hell on my forehead and my t-zone</li>
            <li> It leaked all in the box it was shipped in and my son and I spent 30mins cleaning it up.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin so must be extremely careful what products I use.  </li>
            <li> and I found a few people who reacted the same way.</li>
            <li> I tried the drugstore brand once a few years back.</li>
            <li> but the cetaphil bottles were completely empty because they happen to have leaked all in the box.</li>
            <li> My mom did a lab in microbiology where you took a bacteria swipe and different brands of facewash, put them in a petri dish and saw which ones actually killed bacteria.  </li>
            <li> After a few days my skin was softer but the pimples were about the same.  </li>
            <li> There was absolutely NO allergic reaction after contact.  </li>
            <li> Now, I wet my face, slather on Cetaphil, wash with my finger tips, and rinse.</li>
            <li> There were also random bumps on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> I constantly had at least one big pimple, sometimes two or three and always multiple small, healing pimples.  </li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil, and this appears to be the same stuff, slightly cheaper than you typically find in a store.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin--I once had what was supposed to be a facial specifically for sensitive skin and broke out into nasty hives that required a steroid shot--and this is not irritating</li>
            <li> When they stopped working and starting making my face even worse, my dermatologist told me that all-natural products on sensitive skin can actually react negatively and cause the break-outs that I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> This face wash cleanses my face withOUT leaving it dry and it is so gentle that you can even use it without water and leave a thin film on your face!</li>
            <li> But it does remove make-up, and any other gook on your face.    </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll hope Cetaphil gets with the program and removes the parabens and sulfates, as a lot of other beauty products have followed suit too.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s returned to using CHANEL cleanser, but I am as faithful to Cetaphil as I am to Kiehl&#x27;s for all other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t use any other cleanser on her face now.</li>
            <li> You can use it to wash both body and face which i found is extremely convenient</li>
            <li> I believe it is due to the Cetaphil face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but it never irritates her skin like some other products so we keep anteing up.</li>
            <li> I use it as an all-over product in the shower, as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (over-dry it, or cause breakouts) like other skin washes.</li>
            <li> Was not sealed and smelled like something else other that the Cetaphil</li>
            <li> Once I started using this, I just couldn&#x27;t choose other brands.</li>
            <li> Having used solely Cetaphil for the past 5 years, my skin has been spotless for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if these products have it but the only thing I did not like is that there was no manufacture date or expiry date on the product.</li>
            <li> I have never tried the other cleanser</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 y/o &amp; have very few facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and have very few facial wrinkles and give partial credit to this product plus daily moisturizing  and avoiding the sun.</li>
            <li> but I think we&#x27;re starting to realize that stripping the natural ouls from your skin just makes it angry).</li>
            <li> I struggled with my skin for 6 months, trying all the harsh products on the market to dry my pimples which made my skin angrier.</li>
            <li> Also, it is generally dry after a shower, but a few hours</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would even classify it as acne, but I always have clogged pores on my face and at least once a week a zit that usually causes me pain and leaves behind a light scar.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin real dry or tight feeling either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product might work for some people but it was definitely not right for me.</li>
            <li> and I am half way finishing the other one</li>
            <li> and I actually began to itch so hard I bled.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with hormonal acne, and I&#x27;ve seen SUCH a difference in the past few days.</li>
            <li> Its just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> For me, Parabens are not worth the added risk.</li>
            <li> It may work for some but to me it&#x27;s not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> A cleanser that can be used for your entire body, it also works well on the delicate skin of babies.</li>
            <li> I also have ezcema and I&#x27;m a fairly dark skinned woman.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the packet is awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is white and thick, like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of caring about things like adult acne.  </li>
            <li> None irritating, none drying for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming up on a year of using this and am now down to 1 or 2 pimples a month.</li>
            <li> Keeps irritation down</li>
            <li> We use it on our 2 little twins every other day in the bath.  </li>
            <li> I typically use it at the end of the day because its hard to do &amp;#34;manly things&amp;#34; like grip a jar and open it with slightly slippery hands.</li>
            <li> The last two that I&#x27;ve purchased (not here on Amazon, but at a large chain store) were either bad batches, or Cetaphil changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I switched back to this thinking that my face is a very small percentage of my skin &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products-</li>
            <li> I typically use it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cetaphil can help with one half of that.</li>
            <li> Within a week, half of my breakouts were gone, and in about 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d apply it on my face and massage for about one and half minutes[watched some beauty guru on YouTube</li>
            <li> I admit I am disappointed since I first turned to this product after I read celebrities such as Jessica Alba</li>
            <li> I have had much less acne/ whiteheads</li>
            <li> but I had bumps, pimples and black heads all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I gave him this product and it half cleared up over night.</li>
            <li> It does not bombard your skin with the typical anti-acne products, or drying perfumes, or pore-clogging materials.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing to see the reviews here lower than other very expensive dermatology products- which are actually rated as the top products of face</li>
            <li> I celebrated my 30th birthday this year, and everyone who meets me is shocked when I tell them and they find out</li>
            <li> Although it comes in a pump bottle, I put a little in a sample size bottle because that takes up less space in the medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> I do not use any clensers with water as it makes my skin to tight.  </li>
            <li> After using this product your skin will not feel tight or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> i can go a few hours without using toner or lotion, even though i&#x27;ve always dried out in a few minutes with other cleansers.    </li>
            <li> (I live in England, and buying it there is quite expensive).     </li>
            <li> It does not clean at all.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this cleanser at my local BJ&#x27;s wholesale club, but they have been out of stock lately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from a shield of makeup to hide my face to a little mineral powder and out the door....</li>
            <li> Other products I have used in the past have, but this hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i guess getting a little oil and dirt off your face is no problem for cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my babies, and little kids, around the eyes,,, everywhere.</li>
            <li> After I used that little bottle up, I&#x27;ve been purchasing it and have used nothing else to wash my face with for months.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but not compared to prescription treatments.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product for him and it&#x27;s very hard to find in local stores so I&amp;#34;ve</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and has a clinical scent (not in a bad way) that gives the impression of quality equal to hospital-grade soap.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It gets all of the dirt out of my pours without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I am concerned about a few of its ingredients:  methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben (all three are \\&quot;parabens\\&quot;), cetyl alcohol, AND sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even converted a few friends to the ways of Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any left residue from a wash irritating or breaking out my skin.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin is so difficult to deal with.  </li>
            <li> because I wasn&#x27;t used to this type of cleansing,but after I dried my face</li>
            <li> I also have just come across a few references indicating it affects fertility too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried everything to fix it and it only makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I changed a few months ago</li>
            <li> I also noticed it dries the skin out sometimes and causes flaking, so its helping me remove some of that dead skin on the surface.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, it felt heavy and oily to me.</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulphate is a harsh surfacant, Propylene gylcol is a KNOWN skin irritant.</li>
            <li> I have been using St ives apricot scrub everyday, and that just tore up my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use St ives Green Tea Scrub once a week</li>
            <li> or whenever I have heavy makeup to take off.</li>
            <li> (I also have sensitive eyes that get rashy if I use the wrong product, and I don&#x27;t have any issues with this one).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I just tried to wash it off with water and my hands, the film left behind bothered me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the few reviews of people saying it broke them out with hives, I thought they were exaggerating,but it happened to me.</li>
            <li> Works well on body, and even on face if you&#x27;re particularly dried out.  </li>
            <li> Helps remove dirt from face without the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to use this for a few weeks before making a determination.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and recommended to my relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> I use foundation everyday to cover up my rosacea and this always does the job in washing all traces of makeup off.</li>
            <li> So like any of you, whenever I change a product it takes me a few months to acclimate with my skin I believe, I also believe the change in seasons has an effect on your skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I stop using harsh cleansers with salicylic acid because they were drying out my skin and actually making my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> Just beware that even though its marked \\&quot;mild\\&quot; thats due to it not having fragrance, and there are some harsh, potentially dangerous ingredients inside.</li>
            <li> Just beware that even though its marked \\&quot;mild\\&quot; thats due to it not having fragrance, and there are some harsh, potentially dangerous ingredients inside.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this cleanser above all other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> My babies hate being \\&quot;soaped\\&quot;, but this washes off quickly so there is less crying.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face when I realized that all facial cleansers/soaps were irritating the heck out of my skin with harsh and excessive ingredients and giving me the acne.</li>
            <li> it sjust plain legit.  </li>
            <li> i always looked for products that would work for my skin an the products i used in the past  only made it more,more worse.</li>
            <li> very less achene since I start using this...</li>
            <li> I am immensely thankful; I&#x27;d bow down to this bottle of lotion if it wasn&#x27;t weird.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I can use on real hard working days for moisture.</li>
            <li> have used Cetaphil bars in the past with little concern.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still crazy high.</li>
            <li> I never had serious acne, always an occasional zit or two but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> First, my eyes reacted badly to it, having a burning feeling</li>
            <li> , I will say that with any facial cleanser (especially if you are using this to clear up acne, blemishes, etc) prepare for your FACE to get worst before getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does NOT clean any thing at your face at all!</li>
            <li> given with its gentleness, however I do get rash-like bumps lately which never happened in my previous years of being a cetaphil user before..</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and pregnancy has made it worse.</li>
            <li> not as harsh or tough as my other stuff</li>
            <li> my mom use to use Cetaphil on me when i was little because i had bad dry red skin</li>
            <li> This is like the most boring cleanser to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s supposedly recommended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> I usually dont take time to write a review, but with this product i am making an exception.</li>
            <li> and I have no more breakouts</li>
            <li> No more caring about a referral .</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on your face!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything else for the past 25 years--I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Not sure it does the job I need it to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this to wash my underarms as well, because in the past I&#x27;ve had issues with eczema after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Still not a better product on the market.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The reason why I shop at Amazon is because I am too lazy to go to the store.</li>
            <li> Then I got sort of lazy and stopped washing my face with any cleanser at all.</li>
            <li> (wow, that was a depressing thing to type).  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cetaphil 2 pack came in a small package at my doorstep this morning</li>
            <li> Usually that means I&#x27;m washing my face 2 - 3 times per day.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Usually that means I&#x27;m washing my face 2 - 3 times per day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really not sure what type of skin I have</li>
            <li> When I started investigating particular ingredients, I was shocked and sad to find that Cetaphil contains SEVERAL suspected irritants.</li>
            <li> lathers but turns to a white very thin lather...sort of.  </li>
            <li> My early review confused this product with the Cetaphil Daily Facial Wash (which is horrible).</li>
            <li> I use this every day, in return I have very few wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can be used with or without water, i prefer waterless method when i&#x27;m all in a hurry or very tired to do my night facial regimen.  </li>
            <li> and I have very few (if any) breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the Daily Facial Cleanser stuff from Cetaphil, and bought it by accident once, thinking it would also be unscented.</li>
            <li> I never liked lotion on my face for various reasons; some smelled weird, some made my skin feel greasy, some made me break out....</li>
            <li> I also swear by this product because, my forehead had a lot of dark spots (where I was popping and for reasons I&#x27;m not sure of) and Cetaphil has cleared those up too!!</li>
            <li> Normal soap and detergents cause painful, itchy and unsightly eczema on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather, it DOES feel weird, and how strange that your skin doesn&#x27;t SQUEAK after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but some person whose skin is oily may not suitable for this product.</li>
            <li> A cleanser like this one included in your cleansing is clinically proven to be 4x less irritating.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face pretty badly, where even expensive moisturizers didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is hard to beat, too.</li>
            <li> It was hard to break the habit of wanting that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; skin feeling, but Cetaphil helped significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I hardly moisturized, then I read an article that said oily skin can be caused by this.  </li>
            <li> so it was hard to find a face wash that worked.</li>
            <li> Little known, never advertised, outdated logo, Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> Now I am I my late 20&#x27;s and wish I never used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally ended up moving onto home made, unscented cold process soap for my face.ients within Cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> I personally ended up moving onto home made, unscented cold process soap for my face.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> Has no chemicals added for those fake flowery or medicinal scents that all other liquid cleansers have.</li>
            <li> I was sick of how tight and dry</li>
            <li> My skin can be very difficult, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry your skin like crazy.</li>
            <li> Would anyone seriously do a video review?</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> I like my cleansers to foam and feel like it is doing something, but this cleanser has a watery lotion feel to it that is a little uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> Have not had one serious case of the ugly red pustules since I started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for getting grime off, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it all and will go to the kitchen to use dish soap to get hair product off her hands and things like that.  </li>
            <li> I never understood the hype behind this product, until I started using it regularly during a particularly bad break-out.</li>
            <li> Strangely, my sister-n-law, who had really bad acne, introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sexy; it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> This price is pretty insane...</li>
            <li> Horrified, I jumped back into the shower and tried to wash it off with very cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought a jar of Pond&#x27;s cold cream, which my mother always used when I was little, and haven&#x27;t had any problems</li>
            <li> I reccomend that for people who need something tough to take off the grime without irritating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It stops that horrible itchiness that sometimes accompanies rosacea (due to the dry skin that rosacea creates, not the rosacea itself).</li>
            <li> Boring isn&#x27;t a real issue with this product.  </li>
            <li> When I got the packet, one of the bottles had already broken.</li>
            <li> It is even worse when I use it in the evening</li>
            <li> I bought it, because all the products that had worked for me before stopped (neutrogena and garnier) or even made it worse.  </li>
            <li> It cleans without drying and unnecessary perfumes.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out except for maybe a pimple or 2 every 4 months.   </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but didn&#x27;t improve it either.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worse cleanser I have ever tried...</li>
            <li> but I have tried from Proactiv, to Mario Badescu (which made my skin even worse)</li>
            <li> , I was exhausted and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of hiding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of being something I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li> This however made my skin worse-</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for over five years and my face was still constantly broken out.  </li>
            <li> it provides the lubrication you need for the blade without drying or irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> boring is not my main issue.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there were absolutely NO suds.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, This is not good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For years I suffered from underground pimples and black heads due to terrible face washes.  </li>
            <li> As anyone who knows about dramatic acne treatments, Accutane takes the cake.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but, not too bad and why not treat yourself and your skin?</li>
            <li> She doesnt have as bad dried skin as she used to anymore</li>
            <li> Some (like proactive) dried out my skin so bad that it cracked.</li>
            <li> I think this attributes to a slight worsening of my acen and blackheads, and is really annoying.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the very few products that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout or make me sick with the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know HOW you can go wrong with something so versatile for a fraction of the price of everything else on the market.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a random pimple pop up on my chin anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SLS is also questionable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> Oct 26, 2011*&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The problem with Cetaphil for me, is that it&#x27;s still too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that&#x27;s no longer the case.</li>
            <li> have now stopped using it and started using a moisturiser again and have had one regular spot in about a month (and none of the painful and annoying under the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if it fails.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical of the product, I encourage you to relax and give it 7 days..</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I placed the bottle in my bathroom that I saw it was the wrong</li>
            <li> A cleanser should not be expensive.</li>
            <li> He said there must be some questionable ingredients within Cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> FAIL, FAIL, FAIL and FAIL&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had pimples, but they&#x27;re absolutely laughable compared to the behemoths I used to have.  </li>
            <li> I have had pimples, but they&#x27;re absolutely laughable compared to the behemoths I used to have.  </li>
            <li> Also, Amazon has the cheapest price on it since it can be quite expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> This product is very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and confused by this product.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out and made my skin hurt real bad.</li>
            <li> the pump bottle drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> but some people say they feel their face is still dirty</li>
            <li> The products I used to use burned like crazy on my face.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid to try anything moisturizing because I feared it would make me break out.</li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong!</li>
            <li> It seems like useless product!</li>
            <li> My complexion is clearer than it&#x27;s ever been (I&#x27;m 51) and I&#x27;ve been troubled by acne all my life!</li>
            <li> It does just that, and I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and if you&#x27;re even reading this, you&#x27;re looking for something that might work for you.</li>
            <li> The ugly acne like &#x27;breakouts&#x27; kept me from leaving the house all too often.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was desperate to find a soap or body wash (and shampoo) that doesn&#x27;t cause this horrible allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> After all, I&#x27;m buying a cleanser, not a moisturizer. :(</li>
            <li> after 2 days I started breaking out....:(</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day with very cold water.</li>
            <li> stupidly didn&#x27;t and just bought it.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from this crap.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s one thing I hate paying for, it&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> ALL SKIN TYPES\\&quot; is BAD!</li>
            <li> We had been using all organic products for my son however he got a HORRIBLE yeast rash.  </li>
            <li> This has three of the worst kinds of Parabens in it, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, and Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have HORRIBLE acne for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I realized the stuff is LOADED with alcohol, which is awful for your skin and dries it out.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I could ever put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nasty breakouts all the time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is like the most boring cleanser to use.  I first tried it because it&#x27;s a beauty staple to so many people and so much is written on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a total classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But boring is not my main issue.  Boring isn&#x27;t a real issue with this product.  It&#x27;s not like I need my skin to burn to feel it&#x27;s working or for the product to have some cool fragrance or some microbeads.  I don&#x27;t really need anything in practical except quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone look up the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stupidly didn&#x27;t and just bought it.  There&#x27;s not that many ingredients and so many of it is questionable.  We are learning new things every day through research and the love for this product seems outdated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin and it definitely wasn&#x27;t one of the items that finally got rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin.  I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t foam up, so you have to use a wash cloth with it - your hands alone will not be enough to get the makeup off your face.</li>
            <li> Good  price,good product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, it seems I&#x27;m allergic to everything, and this is the best shaving cream or lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  No irritation, no scent, and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought on-line to save money compared to local stores.  but I like this cleanser more than Dove Bar dermatologist said I could use,  my skin stays soft even though I have psoriasis.  I highly recommend for dry skin, rashes, sunburn - very gentle, more than baby wash.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil moisturizer after I got chemical burns from a facial/peel at a local spa.  I started using Cetaphil about ten years ago, and am still a loyal user to this day!  Their products are fantastic - I have pretty sensitive skin, and I swear by the gentle skin cleanser.  I love how it feels going on, and the fact that it has no scent is a HUGE plus for me.  Please give it a try - if you are like me and you&#x27;ve used every product out there, from the expensive designer lines on down, you are going to be delighted with how great Cetaphil is!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product on my toddler for years, and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin. It washes, but at the same time, there are no suds, and no film remains on the skin. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it rinses off easily and completely, leaving no residue at all (unlike filmy soaps or lotions). In fact, you don&#x27;t even need rinsing water to use it, just wipe off with a paper towel. Cleans oily skin 100% with no irritation or astringency. Can be used multiple times a day without drying out your skin. Has no chemicals added for those fake flowery or medicinal scents that all other liquid cleansers have. Just a pure, simple cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like this product: it is not drying nor does it make my skin oily. I have sensitive skin and prefer products that are aroma free and this fits the bill. I have used it for years and have never had a break-out or skin irritation. I&#x27;m a loyal user. Though I live in New York City, it is often difficult to find the Gentle Skin product in my local drugstores so I order it from Amazon. The Gentle Cleanser has a very different consistancy and feel than the Normal Cetaphil Skin product. I am now using it with the Clarisonic MIa 2.  So far, so good. Cetaphil is also  recommended by a host of dermatologists who have nothing to gain financially by recommending it.  It&#x27;s really great for sensitive and aging skin.  It&#x27;s not sexy; it&#x27;s expensive and I think it works just great!</li>
            <li> A friend and my doctor recommended using Cetaphil for newborns bath. I love it! The cleanser is VERY mild and is perfect for daily bathing of my newborns. It is also not heavy on fragrance - I have very sensitive skin and can only imagine what heavy fragrance can do to newborns. My babies hate being \\&quot;soaped\\&quot;, but this washes off quickly so there is less crying. Highly recommend for newborns.</li>
            <li> I really like this as an everyday, gentle cleanser. I find that some of the acne specific washes really dry out my skin. I have combo skin with the occasional blemish (that&#x27;s fun as a 30 year old) and this helps keep it under control. My skin looks nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is cheap and it lasts a very long time and most importantly, it cleans YOU FACE!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I started using it while pregnant and have continued to use it long after.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it every night on my face and it gently cleans the makeup off and I can use it on my eyes without any problem.  It leaves no greasy residue and I just follow it with a gentle scrub with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil, and this appears to be the same stuff, slightly cheaper than you typically find in a store.</li>
            <li> This is a great gentle but effective product, actually recommended by my dermatologist who sells more expensive things.  I will not buy it from Amazon, though, because the price is incredibly jacked up.  Compare to Walmart (which delivers as well) or a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face for at least 30 years, and my face looks about 15-20 years younger than I really am.  If you&#x27;re young - start using this NOW!  :)</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the packet is awful. When I got the packet, one of the bottles had already broken.</li>
            <li> For a brand that is so widely know, I thought it might work SOME kind of wonders for my face but so far, it&#x27;s done nothing. And it doesn&#x27;t even lather. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s supposedly recommended by dermatologists. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is very confortable when using this item, the best facial cleaner i have ever used.i will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this again. It dried my skin out and made my skin hurt real bad. The only good thing about this product is the bottle..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash since high school. I have combination skin that is super sensitive so I always have a really hard time finding a good cleanser. This one works great! It is a staple in my bathroom and even though I often get lured into buying a more expensive cleanser that promises better results, I always find myself going back to Cetaphil. It gets all of the dirt out of my pours without being too harsh. I love this product for my skin!</li>
            <li> I struggled for years with teen and adult acne.  I tried everything out there and progressed to harsher and harsher products for what I thought was my acne prone oily skin.  It&#x27;s true my skin is oily, but after switching to cetaphil my skin cleared up.  I apply it to my dry skin and than rinse it off with water.  Amazed that something so cheap could work such wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the truth !!! After months of breaking out and causing me new cystic acne everyday after my workouts I bought this . I haven&#x27;t broke out in a entire month. Words can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I finally found a wash that finally cures my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin. I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews on this product about how it is good for dry/gentle skins, and tried it. It does not clean at all. When I use in the morning (when I don&#x27;t have make up on), it leaves my face soft and moisturized after cleaning (which is rare in all the cleansing products I&#x27;ve used), but my face does NOT feel clean at all. It is even worse when I use it in the evening when I do have makeup on, I can still see the makeup after I cleansed twice with this product.    I would not recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve used another brand now and even though my skin does not feel as moisturized, it does not feel dry, and most importantly, it looks and feels much cleaner. After all, I&#x27;m buying a cleanser, not a moisturizer. :(</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a free sample of this after being diagnosed with facial eczema. Here are the pros: gentle, non-irritating, fragrance free, won&#x27;t burn even on inflamed skin.    Now the cons: contains parabens and SLS&#x27;s. I won&#x27;t get into why these chemicals are bad for us here, please take a moment to research those to form your own opinion. Also this cleanser has like a mucus texture to it. Kinda gross feeling.    It doesn&#x27;t lather either. But it does remove make-up, and any other gook on your face.    I do pair this with [[ASIN:B001ET76GW Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], which I do recommend highly.    Bottom line is it&#x27;s gentle for even the most sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m gonna keep looking for a natural alternative that won&#x27;t burn my skin.    And I&#x27;ll hope Cetaphil gets with the program and removes the parabens and sulfates, as a lot of other beauty products have followed suit too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many kinds of face washes, but nothing actually cleared my skin without irritating it (my skin is extremely sensitive). Cetaphil did make my skin \\&quot;purge\\&quot; (got a few painful spots at first), but this is a sign of somthing good happening. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin has never looked or felt better. Their ultra hydrating lotion is also amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil since I read in a beauty magazine years ago that it was the #1 skin cleanser and I agree.  It has helped keep my skin looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for many years; my doctor suggested it as a soap substitute for my allergy prone skin. It&#x27;s gentle, too. I am almost 60 y/o &amp; have very few facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When I find a product to be excellent, I tend to remain loyal.  I may try others, but I return to the one which continues to prove it&#x27;s excellence year after year.  Despite more costly products I&#x27;ve tried as samples, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has been my cleanser of choice for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried a generic brand from CVS and found it to be much more slimy and thick than the real thing and gave it away to a less scrutinizing customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin and eyes are extremely sensitive and can become dry, so I am very cautious when trying new products.  This one was recommended by a dermatologist and I&#x27;m very grateful for the suggestion because it meets my desires in a cleanser.  It is extremely gentle, fragrance free and can be used directly on my eyes.  I apply it onto my dry face, rub it all over, including the eyelids, then rinse it off and pat my face dry.  Although it comes in a pump bottle, I put a little in a sample size bottle because that takes up less space in the medicine cabinet and I never have  drips fall anywhere.  I wash the little bottle to keep it germ free.  I gave a large bottle to my sister because she was so impressed by the cleansing power, too.  Her initial reaction was that it was a little slimy, but after using it as I suggested, she agreed that it is a superior product and a bargain.  In all honesty, I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s returned to using CHANEL cleanser, but I am as faithful to Cetaphil as I am to Kiehl&#x27;s for all other skin care products.  If you too have sensitive skin, try the Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Tonic after cleansing for a nice treat.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and can&#x27;t use soap or shampoo -- this stuff is terrific as a replacement for both.  But don&#x27;t take my word for it; try some!  8)</li>
            <li> I am concerned about a few of its ingredients:  methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben (all three are \\&quot;parabens\\&quot;), cetyl alcohol, AND sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).  Many cosmetics companies are reformulating their products to exclude these ingredients, and yet here are FIVE of them in one product.  I am really surprised, especially since Cetaphil is supposedly recommended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> This Cetaphil skin cleanser is just awesome. It&#x27;s really gentle for sensitive skin and it even moisturizes for drier skin types. I have used this cleanser for years now because of my really dry skin and it&#x27;s the only cleanser that ever left my skin with the not dry/parched feeling after done washing my face. It&#x27;s really great and gentle but still effective! It&#x27;s really low cost and even the more expensive brands I have used still don&#x27;t work as well as cetaphil!</li>
            <li> Great face wash!  Does not dry my face and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive/dry skin and this cleanser is priceless! It doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin or irritate it. Wish we could find it in stores.</li>
            <li> i like this product its good for sensetive skin.my step mother introduced me to this product this she aways gets raches and has very very veryy sensetive skin. it has no fraguence sooo its very good and doesnt clash with your perfume i will purchhace this product soon aafter mine is finished</li>
            <li> This cleanser works great on all skin types, mine being sensitive it works great. It&#x27;s the best of any tried!</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago, when I was in my early 20&#x27;s, I was finally fed up with my decade plus terrors of getting cystic acne along my temples and jawline.  NOTHING WORKED.  After going to my dermatologist in near tears, I begged for Accutane.  As anyone who knows about dramatic acne treatments, Accutane takes the cake.  It literally makes your skin erupt at first and the dries EVERYTHING out.  I found a lip balm, a lotion, and a semi moisturizing body wash, but I still needed something for my face...    Cue my discovery of Cetaphil.  Little known, never advertised, outdated logo, Cetaphil.  This not only kept my skin from being so dry it itched, it actually made it feel BETTER after washing it.  I have used everything from Noxema, to Clean and Clear, to Proactiv, to Aveeno, to Mary Kay, to Clinique.  Nothing compares to Cetaphil.  It&#x27;s been 3 years, and I&#x27;m devoted to this product.  In addition to a face cleanser, I now use it as a body wash, hand soap, and as a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; for shaving.  It&#x27;s my do it all skin cleanser.  I&#x27;ve even converted a few friends to the ways of Cetaphil.  I don&#x27;t know HOW you can go wrong with something so versatile for a fraction of the price of everything else on the market.    It is an adjustment.  It doesn&#x27;t lather, it DOES feel weird, and how strange that your skin doesn&#x27;t SQUEAK after cleaning.  Because of the adjustment, I suggest getting a smaller bottle at first and making sure you can handle the NON-sudsing action.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, powder, or tinted moisturizer, and since my discovery of Cetaphil (which did go hand in hand with my 3 month prescription of Accutane) I have gotten more compliments than ever on my skin tone and texture.  I don&#x27;t plan on switching to another cleanser, possibly ever.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle, removes make up wonderfully and makes  skin moisturized and soft. i would introduce it to my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years and I love how my skin feels; it is so soft.  I have very sensitive skin and feels itchy when I use soap.      This is so gentle and haven&#x27;t found any other product that worked as well for me.  My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have t-zone oiliness, but dry skin (especially in winter) elsewhere. This cleans my face nicely without stripping the dry zones, and leaves my skin dewy but not oily.  I&#x27;ll use water to wash it off if I&#x27;ve used sunscreen for the day, but otherwise I just wipe it off with a washcloth before applying a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to bathe an infant with eczema. It didn&#x27;t help with the eczema and there is absolutely no foam whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought this after reading some reviews. I put it on my face and right away, i had some doubts because first of all, it was slimy, and second of all, it didn&#x27;t lather, so that was weird. But then right away, after rinsing, it left my skin feeling soft and cleansed. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and wow, its just awesome. I haven&#x27;t had a random pimple pop up on my chin anymore. I have realllyyy sensitive skin and this definitely didn&#x27;t burn, make my face red, and dry out my skin, like other cleansers did. It&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> this cleanser works!!!! i love it so much an the best part is its for all skin types  i always looked for products that would work for my skin an the products i used in the past  only made it more,more worse. until i went to cvs and found cetphil it word for me and didnt  make my skin irritated plus my break out when away an i have clear pretty skin so yeah  im really greatful that i have this an it is so gentle.                lloovvee iitt!!!</li>
            <li> Hello there!  I have a combination skin and recently I had lots of breakouts due to changing my pills. I bought it, because all the products that had worked for me before stopped (neutrogena and garnier) or even made it worse.  So I bough the big bottle of this cleanser and in four days there were less breakouts (I had 2-3 new spots per day, which were definitely due to hormonal changes-I know my face quite well) and now after 2 weeks, I have no pimples, spots, blemishes- nothing at all and my skins looks and feels fresh and clean. it&#x27;s not over-dried (most of acne products over dry skins sooo badly that it causes actually more problems).  I&#x27;m planning to get more of this stuff so I don&#x27;t run out of it when I&#x27;m in need (I live in England, and buying it there is quite expensive).     I definitely recommend it :)     Ps. I&#x27;m 21 white female if it helps anyone to compare the facial situation.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties, have adult acne with oily skin and have tried about every acne care product on the market. Over the years I had heard people talk about this cleanser, but thought it wouldn&#x27;t work for me since it wasn&#x27;t packaged like an acne care line. Was I ever wrong! I&#x27;ve been using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, benzoyl peroxide and the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer twice daily for a month and the difference in my skin has been amazing. My skin is the clearest it has been in years (almost all acne is gone) and the texture has improved quite a bit. My red marks have started fading and I finally don&#x27;t feel embarrassed by my face. I&#x27;ve gone from a shield of makeup to hide my face to a little mineral powder and out the door....which is very handy since I have a 10-month old son!    FOLLOW UP (3/13/2011)  Still loving this product and using the same face cleaning regiment listed above. I&#x27;m coming up on a year of using this and am now down to 1 or 2 pimples a month. That&#x27;s a far cry from where I was a year ago when I was embarrassed to go out sometimes because of my breakouts. My husband says my skin looks great and I have to agree! Not only do I now have clear skin, but I have very soft skin.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle cleanser that works just as well as harsher benzyl containing products.  If you use dove soap on your face this works with as much gentleness.</li>
            <li> We had been using all organic products for my son however he got a HORRIBLE yeast rash.  Our MD recommend this...it&#x27;s not tear free so be careful around the face...but it has made a HUGE difference.  My 1 yr old skin was better in 2-3 days.  I use this as well because it helps with my eczema.</li>
            <li> I loved using cetaphil products for about a year but unfortunetly for me it did not remove my blackhead blemishes so I am now using another product hoping the blemishes go away.</li>
            <li> I use the cetaphil antibacteria bar soap at home as it was recommended to me by my dermatologists, however I bought this liquid soap to use in work.  Although it is not antibacterial, it is gentle on the face and it is less messy for me to use at work as opposed to the bar soap which would have to be stored in a container, melt etc....</li>
            <li> I recently decided to ditch all of the face wash products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid because I no longer have much acne and these products always left my face feeling overly dry and tight. Additionally, my face has recently become more sensitive so I wanted something mild to wash my face with. The Cetaphil certainly is gentle on my face, but because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like my face is completely clean. Of course if it had the ingredients to make it lather, I&#x27;m sure it would probably dry out my face, so I&#x27;m actually glad that it doesn&#x27;t lather, kind of. The instructions are kind of ambiguous, so I&#x27;ve used it two different ways where I wet my face first then apply or just apply it directly on my dry face. I&#x27;ve found that one way doesn&#x27;t really seem to be better than the other, so it&#x27;s just a matter of preference. When I wash off the Cetaphil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight, which is great, but I don&#x27;t know how well of a job it really does in cleaning my face because over the month that I used it, I noticed that my face broke out more often. I have bought another product to wash my face with, but every now and then, I&#x27;ll come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but it had been developing dry patches recently. I switched to this a couple months ago and the dryness is noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you wear make-up, this isn&#x27;t excellent for removing that. My organic mascara mostly smears under my eyes. I don&#x27;t like have to rub around my eyes that much longer to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t burn, fragrance free, dye free, good for sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it does such a great job having sulfates, Galderma should really do something about that...they can irritate sensitive skin even more among other problems.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather and is slimy.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather makes me feel like I&#x27;m using too much because I keep pumping more and more...&lt;br /&gt;We use this for our baby&#x27;s bath time too since he had baby acne and sensitive skin.  There was an immediate difference in his skin after we tossed the Johnson&#x27;s washes in the closet and started cetaphil...it&#x27;s also good on cradle cap..it doesn&#x27;t lather yes but it works really well somehow!  My son is kissably soft now instead of dry and rashy!</li>
            <li> I hear people rave about this product.  It&#x27;s supposedly great for sensitive skin.  However, it contains Cetyl Alcohol, which basically equates to letting wax just sit on your skin.  There aren&#x27;t any ingredients that will irritate the skin, but none with any cleansing properties either, defeating the purpose of a facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s good to look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid to remove dirt/debris and exfoliate.  Overall, people should do their research if they want results.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin ever since he was a baby. Different baby washes would cause dry skin, rashes and itchiness. The pediatrician recommended this which was not surprise since I use it too to clean my face. I bath my son using Cetaphil (which is kind of expensive baby wash) but having a happy baby with no itchy skin is well worth it. My Mom who is very old had dry skin and when I told her about Cetaphil, she used it and was pleasantly surprised on how it well it cleansed and kept her skin moist. She won&#x27;t use any other cleanser on her face now. This is definitely much better than store brand equivalents. I have tried store brands and they can&#x27;t beat the original Cetaphil brand.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can also use this product without water. How cool is that? Very convenient and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any left residue from a wash irritating or breaking out my skin.</li>
            <li> First off, I have combination skin, a little bit of acne and acne scars. I switched to this product after using Noxzema (which was good for the first month but after that didn&#x27;t do much). I bought this product in the hope that it would not dry out my face, clear my skin, and reduce the appearance of my acne scars. And that it did. So far I&#x27;ve been only using it for a week now but I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my face. My routine goes like this: I wash my face with water (once in the morning and night), gently rub Cetaphil all over my face, then rinse it off! That simple. My skin has never felt so healthy. It&#x27;s so light and goes on smoothly. I recommend this product to anyone, its so gentle I couldn&#x27;t even imagine it doing any harm to anyone&#x27;s face. I&#x27;ve learned that this product has a pH of 7 which is just like water only with a little more benefits ;)</li>
            <li> This might be a fantastic cleanser for those with hyper sensitive skin but if you&#x27;re anything like me, I would recommend something a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I always thought my skin was a bit sensitive but there are different levels of sensitivity. I can tolerate mild fragrance and mild soaps so after trying this, I realized I don&#x27;t need something this gentle. Because this product is truly gentle...like water.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser does nothing to clean my t-zone or remove daily make-up. My face still feels like it needs to be washed again right after using this cleanser. It&#x27;s like I used nothing at all. I stopped using it and downgraded this cleanser to a hand wash so that I can quickly use it up. But as suspected, I can&#x27;t wash anything with this stuff to get it clean. What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend you evaluate your skin type before making this purchase. If you&#x27;re not THAT sensitive, and you like a little bit of fragrance and that CLEAN feeling, try Basis Gel Cleanser (green tube) or Clean &amp; Clear Sensitive Cleanser (clear bottle with purple pump). Both are available on Amazon and have glowing reviews. Cheers!</li>
            <li> This product is recommended for sensitive skin, which is why I bought it. My daughter and I both are allergic to most soaps and lotions. This stuff contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a very common irritant, and I developed itching and rashes from it after only a couple of uses. Very disappointing. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been skipping around different facial cleansers for the past 10 or so years, just getting a different brand every time i ran out.  i&#x27;ve used products from neutrogena, st ives, clearasil, clean and clear, and even different types of bar soap.  this is the only time i&#x27;ve ever bought a second bottle to continue usage (and these are pretty large!).      i love it- it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my face without water, but my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t even dry out.  i can go a few hours without using toner or lotion, even though i&#x27;ve always dried out in a few minutes with other cleansers.    i&#x27;m also acne prone, but this has been fine with that.  i think the mildness actually makes it better because my redness has never flared up, it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> excellent cleanser and about the only one without a fragrance</li>
            <li> It can do good work and worth the price. It may be not that sufficient but I use it just to do normal cleaning two or three times a day so I need it to be gentle.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It cleans without drying and unnecessary perfumes.  Just a natural, good, clean feeling.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Come on Cetaphil.  Are you kidding?  Paraben of all things?  I understand it is a ubiquitous preservative but it&#x27;s not necessary to include it in this face/body wash.  This is probably worse than Eucerin&#x27;s calming skin cream since it is used in the shower where the hot water opens up the pores in the skins and thus expedites topical absorption of paraben into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SLS is also questionable.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and it&#x27;s especially good for long winter in Michigan. I don&#x27;t need to worry about showering everyday now since my skin stays soft and moisturized afterwards. I don&#x27;t feel itchy because of the dryness anymore. You can use it to wash both body and face which i found is extremely convenient</li>
            <li> Gentle formula helps keep skin clean without drying it out or causing oiliness.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, sesative, mature skin.  I do not use any clensers with water as it makes my skin to tight.  All i have been using and still do at times, is Neutrogena hydrating makeup remover cleansing towelettes, but they cost $6.00 for 25 pre-moistened toweletts , cetaphil works as well and makes my skin soft and clean.  I put a quater size, sometimes a little more, on my face, gently rub/massage it in, often in circular motion, till it..not lathers but turns to a white very thin lather...sort of.  Then I takea soft cloth and gently wipe most of the cream off, leaving a thin film to moisterize.  If, as in our very humid summer, my face fills to moist or greasy, i ether use a soft cloth with warm water and gently and lightly wipe my face then pat dry with a towl, or use mild toner before using moisterizer.  At least for normal and dry skin this works.  And , for me at least, it takes off makeup and dirt and leaves my face filling clean, not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 10 years old and she needs something to wash her face every night. Is this ok for a 10 year old? ANSWER IN A REVEIW PLEASE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years. I used to use clearasil..clean and clear etc.. My face kept breaking out with those.  My derm. reccomended this cleanser and I haven&#x27;t broken out except for maybe a pimple or 2 every 4 months.   It keeps my skin really soft and fresh..doesn&#x27;t lather, which is supposed to be good. Get MOST of my makeup off..alot of the time I have to use more and more and rerinse my face to get all of my eye and face makeup off.  Over all, this cleanser is the best.</li>
            <li> I usually dont take time to write a review, but with this product i am making an exception. I have tried multiple acne products; Such as Proactive, Murad, and countless products from walmart shelves. I decided to try this. i bought it about a month ago and it is amazing. I have very acne prone skin, i have been suffering since middle school and I am 20 years old now. Honestly the acne isnt 100% gone; but it is 100% better than the other brands. Some people use it to take the make up off too; but instead i use a make up remover wipe and than use the cleanser. It does cause some dryness but slap some lotion on and its gone. So if you decide to buy this product I wish you the best of luck!</li>
            <li> I really like thia product, but the gentle cleanser feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the normal one. But if you have really sensitive skin, I would get this one.</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect , I have oily skin and most soaps for oily let skin so dry , this one removes the grease but dont leave my skin dry, on the contrary, it leaves very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying everything under the sun...Clinique, Clearasil, any product with salicylic acid, etc.  Reviews convinced me this would be a great product.  It did nothing special for my skin at all.  Still had the same breakouts.  Didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but didn&#x27;t improve it either.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. I had read reviews of different customers getting the lotion instead of the cleanser, so I was worried, but I was shipped the proper product.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no scent and is gentle. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry out if I use it. But it just doesn&#x27;t give you the same \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling that you get by using a glycerin soap, which also leave your skin really feeling dry, probably &#x27;coz it strips out all the oil on the skin. A bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> Use this twice a day followed by anti wrinkle cream.  Skin softer and smoother after two weeks.  No noticeable miracles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years now.  It is great for mild acne or once in awhile break out.  I use it as a facial clenser and my skin has always responded well to it.  It is very mild and leaves your skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this using Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> This is sencond time i bought this product. This product is very good for cleaning your skin. And it would protect my skin from oil. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products. The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly. The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> received lotions in place of cleanser</li>
            <li> My younger sister recommended this to me. I used it for a while and liked it because it cleaned my skin and most importantly left no residue. However, since I am not prone to breaking out (thank God those days are over) I don&#x27;t think I need to keep using a product with that specialization. If you just want to keep your face clean (and avoid breaking out as a result) I recommend Kroger&#x27;s facial cleaner. It serves one primary purpose - clean dirt and oil off your face. It&#x27;s just what I need without all the bells and whistles that comes with so many other cleansers on the market today. Add (organic) sugar and you have yourself a nice facial scrub :-)</li>
            <li> Very good, the price is also cheaper With the help of a very good on the skin Future will consider use it all the time</li>
            <li> This has to be the worse cleanser I have ever tried...I thought because of the gr8 user reviews I would give this a try...yuckkkk....I like a clean feel after I&#x27;ve washed my face...with this it feels ummm greasy there&#x27;s this film on your face...i tried washing again to be certain i was doing it right...still the same...after 2 days I started breaking out....:(....I have combination skin and this definitely didn&#x27;t work for me...A better cleanser for me was the Clean and Clear sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013/05/22&lt;br /&gt;I needed to come back and review this item, I have since retried the cetaphil cleanser but this time I used it with my Clarisonic Mia as I was looking for a cleanser that was not harsh. I had started Retin A and had to deal with the flakiness and peeling of my skin, that&#x27;s when I remembered Cetaphil and how it left that oily film on my face, I decided to give it a try, and surprisingly the combination worked.  I have now found my magical combo and I have no more breakouts, I am one happy camper. This might not be for everyone but because I use the Retin A, the Cetaphil provides the perfect balance for my face now.</li>
            <li> Great Great Great !!!! After I started used this product my face is become very smooth . very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I was prescribed a generic version of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleaners for all skin types, with the exact same ingredients as Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is white and thick, like a lotion. It does not lather whatsoever, so if you need your SLS to foam up, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very gentle and keeps my skin clean. I use it morning and night, and during the day after exercise and work. I typically use it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also follow up morning and night with acne medication my doctor prescribed, which he warned may dry out my skin and to follow up with an oil free moisturizer. I have yet to use any moisturizer because my skin hasn&#x27;t been dry. I believe it is due to the Cetaphil face wash. Because of this, I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I lowered it from 4 starts to 2 stars. I stopped using this after almost finishing my first bottle. I think this product cleans the face but also leaves a film on the skin, like if you were to wash your cade with conditioner. I think this attributes to a slight worsening of my acen and blackheads, and is really annoying. Because of this I no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, does what it claims</li>
            <li> After numerous dermatological visits on how to clear my occasional break outs, the one message repeated by my doctor was: be gentle to your face.  I suppose, then, that it should come as no surprise that he suggested using Cetaphil as my daily face wash; its so gentle that you could lather it on and wipe it off with a towel instead of rinsing it off with water (if so inclined).    It&#x27;s non-greasy, and especially important during the winter, non-drying.  Simply, it&#x27;s an effective cleanser that works well, even with my oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and has not been able to tolerate regular baby body washes since he was little. We still use this for him in the bath. Keeps him clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate his eczema.</li>
            <li> In some reason Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser \\&quot;FOR ALL SKIN TYPES\\&quot; is BAD! it does NOT clean any thing at your face at all! It seems like useless product! DO NOT BUY IT! I did feel regret when I bought 2 big bottles (20oz each) from Costco and I did open both of them for my 2 different bathrooms... so I won&#x27;t be able to return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the same Cetaphil for \\&quot;For Normal to Oily Skin\\&quot; does an excellent work! So be carefull when you pick the Cetaphil skin cleanser products!</li>
            <li> It really works well on sensitive  skin. I can&#x27;t use anything else on my face. It is also a really good value through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is working for me so far...very less achene since I start using this...cant beat the price either...great product for the price and it satisfy my expectation. I will recommend this to anyone....</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews, I really wanted this product to work. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case. I purchased it about 6 weeks ago and used it day and night for the first 4 weeks. I have very dry, sensitive skin that is prone to blemishes and mild acne. This product wasn&#x27;t &#x27;enough&#x27; of anything.  It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, it didn&#x27;t help my break outs at all, it didn&#x27;t take make-up off very well.  On the flip side, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin real dry or tight feeling either.  It was just so-so. Nothing great, nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> I was using cetaphil in my earlier years...(HS) and my skin was perfect, everyone complimented me for my skin. Then I grew up...saw things on TV and magazines, and had my own money to buy these things and my skin got so bad. In my 30&#x27;s now, and I am experiencing having acne for the first time. I know it is such a cliche but I have tried from Proactiv, to Mario Badescu (which made my skin even worse) Neutrogena, The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil, scrubbing, exfoliating, drinking gallons of water, but nothing worked. So I have decided to go back to Cetaphil, I thought it was just a cleanser with no acne fighting ingredients but I didn&#x27;t care anymore, I was exhausted and I didn&#x27;t want to experiment, and now it has been a month and I don&#x27;t have breakouts on my face anymore, just some scars from old pimples that are healing now. Cetaphil is a really great product and now my daily regimen is just so simple, wash my face in the morning and at night, no creams to put on after wards, no toners or serum, just wet, wash, rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for 15 years and it is, by far, the best facial cleanser I have ever used. Yes, throughout the years I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;persuaded\\&quot; by cosmetics dealers in various department stores to switch to their brands, but, I always come back to Cetaphil. If you have super sensitive skin, as I do, this is the best product for you. I look forward to using this product for many years to come.   This product is also great for baby. I used it to bathe my daughter when she was a baby. She&#x27;s 9 years old now and uses it everyday to wash her face.  This is a phenomenal product!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, works great. I do like it slightly more than the generic for some reason.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li> great seller, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Use the soap bars and this cleanser for a while now.  Skin feels great.  We use it on our 2 little twins every other day in the bath.  They handle it very well too.  No dry skin and it helped remove their cradle cap quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I wash my beard with this every morning prior to shaving.  It&#x27;s perfect for ridding the face of oil and making the beard ready for a very close shave that does not disturb my skin.  If you like shaving in the shower (which I do not because I&#x27;ve never found a shower mirror that actually works), then that is even better, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase Cetaphil through Amazon, but I thought I&#x27;d write a review on it for anyone out there who&#x27;s thinking about trying this product. I LOVE it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING though, I don&#x27;t believe this product is for everyone. Based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, it seems that whether or not people like Cetaphil is extremely varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve had great success with Cetaphil. I have rosacea, and found that Cetaphil has greatly reduced the number of papules and pustules that pop up on my cheeks. I&#x27;m currently in the process of finding my perfect rosacea skin care routine, but to think that Cetaphil alone, a simple, gentle face wash, has almost cleared up my rosacea is pretty cool, and encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also reduced the overall redness of my face, and is very soothing to my skin. It stops that horrible itchiness that sometimes accompanies rosacea (due to the dry skin that rosacea creates, not the rosacea itself). I put it on, and ahhhh. Feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complain that it leaves a film on your face, but if you READ the back of the bottle, they say to wipe off the product just enough so that there&#x27;s a slight film on your face. I personally haven&#x27;t really noticed this, but I think it&#x27;s because my skin&#x27;s so dry. I&#x27;ve noticed it a little bit, but I just wipe my face a little more, even though you&#x27;re not really supposed to do that, with my cotton rounds (using spring water). It leaves my face feeling nice and clean, and soft. I was also surprised at how nicely it cleaned up my pores (I have blackhead issues as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product. Thanks, Cetaphil! You&#x27;re a Godsend! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and seems to do the job.  No scent and do not expect it to lather like soap.  It is more like a lotion.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is fine as a face lotion.  It is very good for my acne prone skin.  I don&#x27;t care for this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought the Cetaphil would allow for a water-less face wash. This particular formulation requires a water rinse. The old formula is better. I don&#x27;t like the smell of the new water-rinse formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update Oct 26, 2011*&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. This is the waterless formula. As far as I can tell, it does not require a water rinse. I use it for my skin, body, and hair. The non-foaming formula prevents hair frizz. No-scent formula. My early review confused this product with the Cetaphil Daily Facial Wash (which is horrible).</li>
            <li> I like the Cetaphil lotion but the pump bottle drives me crazy.  It is hard to open and then stops working when the bottle is still one-third full.  I will try to find the same lotion in a jar but will not buy the pump container again.</li>
            <li> * Like the cleanser, don&#x27;t like the Parabens and SLS  * Great consitency did not make me break out but my skin can take alot not that sensitive  * Still in search for a perfect cleanser, want to try the CeraVe, Avon Platinum, Glam Nation  * Looks like the Obagi Cleansers do well, just alitle pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a germaphobe for many years so I often washed/wash my hands with hand soap. After using various hand soaps to wash up, my hands would get very dry-so dry throughout the day, that they would get flaky and my skin would peel as if my hands were a surface composed of dandruff. I don&#x27;t remember what exposed me to Cetaphil because I first used the product years ago, but I purchased it and LOVED that it retained moisture while I washed. The problem with Cetaphil for me, is that it&#x27;s still too expensive. It&#x27;s costs about the same here on Amazon as it does in my local Walgreens (it&#x27;s about $10-$11), so for some time now, I&#x27;ve resorted to purchasing the Walgreens brand of the same product. The Walgreens brand isn&#x27;t as costly (it&#x27;s about $7.50-$8) but it&#x27;s still crazy high. And I run through a 16oz bottle like this in about 2 1/2-3 weeks. So we&#x27;re talking well over $100 on hand soap every year. Effective product, but unfortunately it&#x27;s a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser because it&#x27;s very GENTLE. But if your skin is oil to combination, I think it&#x27;s not a very strong product to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin that I have ever tried, including some of the more expensive high end cosmetic brands. It is non-abrasive, but cleans thoroughly, even makeup. It is also very versatile, because you can rinse it off with water, with or without a face cloth, or just wipe it off with a clean cloth or tissue. Great for traveling when you want to clean your face in an airplane restroom without having to wrestle with the faucets and teeny-tiny basin! By the way, because it is soap-free and has ingredients that are non-irritating, it is also good for cleansing eczematous skin and other rashes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been playing with make-up again, and whilst rummaging through the linen closet for something, I spied a jug of Cetaphil I&#x27;ve had for who knows how long. I tried it first with water and it took off my makeup (had to use a bit of oil on the eye stuff), and my skin was awesomely soft and dewey feeling afterwards.  I tried it again the next day without water, and looooved it!! Make-up wearers / lovers, etc., this stuff is GREAT for taking off the day from your face. I recommend buying cotton pads in bulk - you&#x27;ll be hooked!! Love it! SUPER GENTLE! For reference, I&#x27;m 40ish, have pretty normal skin that leans more towards oily than dry (def. not dry), though i think this would actually probably be great for someone with skin a bit oilier than mine (which sounds counterintuitive, I know - but I think we&#x27;re starting to realize that stripping the natural ouls from your skin just makes it angry). If you have oily skin, perhaps foloowing the cleansing with a swab of a gentle toner / mild astringent (witch hazel is awesomefor SO many things!!) would getcha nice n right.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema and this product is the only product in the drug stores that actually works and helps get rid of her itching. Highly recommend this product for all skin types. Especially those whom have skin problems like eczema. I myself also use it and it works wonderfully on my skin whenever I have brakeouts. It doesn&#x27;t take long for this product to help get rid of my blemishes all at once.</li>
            <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for many years now. Now all my children use it. My dermatologist actually recommended it. I would also suggest the Cetaphil lotion. It works perfect in summer, spring, fall or winter. Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist 7 years ago.  I still use it and for my toddler as it was recommended by his nurse early on.  Can&#x27;t get any more gentler than this and would not use other regular soaps.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who don&#x27;t want to use a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this product at first, but i figured what do I have to lose. And now I LOVE IT! I have combination/oily skin and I was using proactiv for 5 years and finally decided to stop using it because although my skin was clear, it was also EXTREMELY dry and I was tired of spending so much money every month. As expected, I broke out like hell on my forehead and my t-zone and I didn&#x27;t really know what to do. I did some research and came across this product and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I see a significant difference in my skin overall. I would definately suggest this product to anyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> High quality face cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin too much. Great compliment to the Cetaphil moisturizing lotion that I use daily.</li>
            <li> use daily for soft skin</li>
            <li> I use this every day, in return I have very few wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth an silky.  It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FACIAL CLEANSER AND I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> We are huge fans on this product in our house !  Our 11 month old and myself have dealt with different type eczema the past year. Her usually appears around the ankles and flares up with certain foods. Mine is the blistering type of hand eczema .  Cetaphil, so far, has been the only brand of gentle skin cleanser that does not irritate our very sensitive skin or cause it to flare up and sting. Any time we stray and try something more \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; such as California Baby , Toms, or even Aquaphor Baby, we are utterly unsatisfied and always come back to Cetaphil. It is a life savor.  I will say that it&#x27;s not great on baby&#x27;s hair and that is fine because it&#x27;s made for the skin, not hair. If you want something for your baby&#x27;s hair, we use the Aquaphor Baby wash only on the hair and use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser for the rest of her body.  This product always leaves our little girl so silky soft !  It does contain things such as parabens but I have yet to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin cleaner that is good. Each time I try a more natural one it is very watery and dries your skin out. I&#x27;ll take my parabens over irritated, dry skin any day !  Anytime someone asks for a recommendation for a cleanser for babies, Cetaphil is my first suggestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser in the past and never had a problem with it. Unfortunately that&#x27;s no longer the case. First, my eyes reacted badly to it, having a burning feeling hours after I washed my face. And this could be from the fact that I had to wash my face twice to remove my makeup, especially my eyes. I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup, but you would have thought I did. I&#x27;d been using CeraVe, but found it too drying (though it had NO problem removing my makeup), which is when I switched to the Cetaphil. I don&#x27;t know if the formula/ingredients changed or what...but something is different with this product.</li>
            <li> Takes off make-up, cleans and softens skin, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes. Works wonderfully with the rest of my skincare regimen. I use a salicylic acid serum at night which does its job but leaves my skin very dry and itchy. Using Cetaphil in the morning takes off the nighttime yuckiness and makes my skin feel so, so much better!</li>
            <li> I found this actually from a suggestion by someone else online. It&#x27;s disappointing to see the reviews here lower than other very expensive dermatology products- which are actually rated as the top products of face care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally bought ~150$ worth of dermatology products because they were rated so high, but they ended up irritating my face and making my acne worse. My acne is only mild, but started breaking out more recently- however thanks to this product alone, it&#x27;s all clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower and gently rub it all over my face, then rinse it off after about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night and every morning I take a shower, and I&#x27;m sure to use this every time I do.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. It is so convenient and non-messy in that you do not have to rinse it off. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of hiding.  I&#x27;m tired of being something I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;m tired of adult acne.  I&#x27;m tired of caring about things like adult acne.  I want to live freely.  I want to swim in oceans with people who love me and whom I love back.  Cetaphil is gentle.  It works harder than most cleansers and uses half the ingredients.  My Mom uses Cetaphil as well, so not only have I found it to be effective but also somewhat nostalgic and sentimental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is gentle on skin, including sensitive skin.  Sensitive skin is so difficult to deal with.  It seems to outrun itself with each passing stress.  The best you can do is hold your face in a towel after gently cleansing your face with Cetaphil and listen to a little Stevie Nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of your skin and go find those people to go to the ocean with.  Cetaphil can help with one half of that.</li>
            <li> I have gone to many dermatologist for my acne, and taken many different medicines (both pill and creams) none seem to work very well or the effects wear off over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I used this and my acne is much better! Not perfect, but good enough for me to stop looking for anything different! If you have acne you need to try this product!!! It probably doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works great for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not it has not dried out my skin. Other products I have used in the past have, but this hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over thirty years to remove my eye makeup and face makeup.  Nothing is better!  I would be lost without it!</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and this is the only cleanser that works for his skin. We&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really works.</li>
            <li> I have used every baby product on my twins. One of the twins has dry skin, the other is normal. Only Cetaphil works for the dry skin baby. Great as a shampoo too.</li>
            <li> very good thing! love it! want it! enjoy it! so good ! Let is buy it!!! perfect!! u can have it!  ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the CREAM for years and love it.  I thought I&#x27;d try this - and it&#x27;s exactly as it says...  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, and is very gentle.  AND it isn&#x27;t perfumed - which I like.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years on my sensitive facial skin for thorough cleansing without backlash.  As advertised, it is gentle, safe, and effective.</li>
            <li> This product contains three dangerous parabens strongly linked to cancer. Stay away from this stuff. Research all the ingredients before you buy.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist years ago. Excellent for people who suffer from dermititis ocassionally.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup but I always add miscellar toner after cetaphil to make sure skin is super clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be used as a daily soap and face wash. It is extremely light and I felt as though it was not give me a strong enough clean feeling to continue use. I imagine this would be more focused to individuals with allergies or skin concerns.</li>
            <li> Actually I ordered Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2). Then they sent me Cleansing Bar 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6) by Cetaphil. Amazingly, the price of the 2 items are the same.&lt;br /&gt;Although I think the bar is good, but the items are not the one I ordered. So I would like to give a 2-star.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. It&#x27;s pricey but it never irritates her skin like some other products so we keep anteing up.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this for me. I&#x27;ve been trying it out for the past week (by itself so that I could see actual results), and so far I&#x27;m pleased. I have combination skin with hormonal acne, and I&#x27;ve seen SUCH a difference in the past few days. I do recommend a good moisturizer after using this, but overall it&#x27;s a great product. Due to personal preference, I won&#x27;t continue to use this product because of the *ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very gentle, fragrance free, and the texture is like a light lotion that is easy to wash off. It does not lather, but the texture of it makes it a great cleanser to massage your face with. A very good price for the size that you get (two 16-oz bottles!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ingredients are: water, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.</li>
            <li> Great for a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is great for those of us with sensitive skin.  I need a gluten-free product and this cleanser is described as GF.  Lisa K</li>
            <li> I use this product as a facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil facial cleanser because it works well for dry skin--the facial cleanser is for normal to oily. [[ASIN:B001ET79H8 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, 16.0 -Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]Whatever your skin type, this is a terrific product. Any dermatologist will tell you that expensive skin care products simply aren&#x27;t worth the money, and that&#x27;s certainly been my experience. The Amazon price is hard to beat, too. Use along with the bar soap for the bath to solve all your dry or sensitive skin issues. [[ASIN:B001ET76E4 Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar, 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> I purchased several of this item for a granddaughter who battles eczema, especially in the winter, and kept one for myself. It is truly gentle and may even moisturize. Both my toddler granddaughter and I have reduced itching from dryness. I will definitely purchase this item again next winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only thought: I KNOW that perfumes can irritate some peoples skin....but, I really miss a light scent.....</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. Two big bottles of facial cleanser for the same price as 1 smaller bottle from the drug store.</li>
            <li> We have been on a constant search for a cleanser for my husband that won&#x27;t irritate his excema.  The search is over! This stuff feels like you&#x27;ve just put on lotion after every washing. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Same classic product! My dermatologist recommends this cleanser above all other expensive brands. Also, great to use on baby&#x27;s gentle skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I used Cetaphil.  A friend had recommended it for makeup removal, so I ordered it. I have been using it for about a week, and really like it.  It does the job and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This has been my facial cleanser for years. I am white, have skin a bit sensitive to light and redness. This was initially recommended by my dermatologist. I use it daily when I shower.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter to see if it will help with her complexion issues....bumps and such...cross your fingers!!</li>
            <li> By following a sugar free diet and taking my probiotics I can usually keep my acne at bay.  I use this everyday and it provides gentle cleansing without harsh chemicals.  It doesn&#x27;t suds so I questioned it&#x27;s ability to clean my face but with a warm washcloth my face feels as clean as ever.  I also love the pump and the size it comes in.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing - getting your face clean is much more about the mechanical action of your hands/washcloth/brush than the actual cleanser. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin (isolated pimples rather than widespread breakouts). I tried all of the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; salicylic acid cleansers, but I found they tend to irritate my skin and cause more breakouts. I can&#x27;t explain why Cetaphil works. I don&#x27;t fully understand. And I can&#x27;t use the Original formula, either - only the Gentle. But for sensitive, oily skin, it&#x27;s pretty great. It soothes my skin (especially after I go on a pore-squeezing spree) and seems to keep it clear better than medicated formulas. I follow up with a witch hazel toner and rosehip oil for moisture + salicylic gel on spots.</li>
            <li> The product was out of the packaging and leak. I recevied a refund for this item however, I would have rather had the merchandise. It leaked all in the box it was shipped in and my son and I spent 30mins cleaning it up. One bottle was okay and I was very happy. This is a wonderful product the shipping was just a little off.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with body acne for years and have tried a lot of different soaps, cleansers and lotions trying get it under control. None of those methods ever worked for me and then i read a review by an individual who had the same problem and she said that cetaphil helped clear her skin of acne. So I gave it a try. Within a week, half of my breakouts were gone, and in about 3 my skin was completely clear. Ive never had anything work that well for me, I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product, it really is a skin miracle for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this skin cleanser for close to 20 years and love it!!!  Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and removes makeup wonderfully.  Gentle enough to remove eye makeup too.  Leaves skin moisturized and soft.  Be sure not to confuse with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser...totally different, but deceivingly similarly looking on the shelf.</li>
            <li> As a woman of 61 I&#x27;ve been having, since menopause, extremely dry skin. My dermatologist recommended this wash to start my beauty routine. I use it all over my body plus a cream moisturizer before I towel off out of the shower. It really helps my face not to feel dry or drawn but actually moist like when I was younger. I really recommend it to anyone who is suffering dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it here for the great price &amp; it&#x27;s always available which isn&#x27;t true of stores near where I live.</li>
            <li> family members with contact dermatitis swear by this.  it&#x27;s not so much fun as foamy frothy soap, but that&#x27;s ok.  it is fun not  to have  rashes!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy it, it very useful for the person who live in CA , makes my skin not very dry but some person whose skin is oily may not suitable for this product.</li>
            <li> A facial cleanser that is very gentle but very effective.  Just a squirt is enough to clean your face.  Rinses off with out leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. I love this facial cleanser! It is so mild and soft on my skin and it has helped my skin look younger and to feel softer. I use this after I use St. Ives Apricot Scrub. I have totally noticed that my skin looks and feels softer and I have less wrinkles as using both these products have removed old dead skin cells...revealing my soft new skin :)</li>
            <li> BEWARE: The two bottles I received were filled with a soap that was definitely not Cetaphil. Returned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and have always been satisfied with it. I have tried other more expensive cleansers/soaps for sensitive skin, but this works the best for my sensitive skin/minor rosacea etc.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have found for my face.  I&#x27;m treating acne and my face has looked better now then it ever has.  I wash it at night with this and rinse with just water in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love using this face wash, it makes my face feel clean without that overly dry feeling afterwards. It does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great soap for sensitive hands, it&#x27;s all I can use.  Best price on amazon if you get automatic delivery they wave shipping.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a year now in combination with some topical acne medicine and my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for about 10 years....just love it as it never stings or causes my skin to be dry.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and have very few facial wrinkles and give partial credit to this product plus daily moisturizing  and avoiding the sun.</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil, so... if you do, this is a steal! I use it as an all-over product in the shower, as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (over-dry it, or cause breakouts) like other skin washes.</li>
            <li> Best product for cleansing sensitive skin.  Don&#x27;t use anything else.  None irritating, none drying for sensitive skin.  I am 74 and have people stop me to tell me how good my skin looks...people I don&#x27;t even know (sometimes I think they might need glasses) but will take any complement I can get!</li>
            <li> iv used this product before, i have always had very problematic skin and when i began using the product everything has cleared up. i tried nuetrogena, im highly allergic to garnier products and i just tried the olay swirly blue one that was advertised on tv. well im back to this-cetaphil. it quickly dries out the pimples i do get and i read a review on here she also uses the ddf (great stuff i found at tjmax) but some people say they feel their face is still dirty and then another review said this stuff contains chemicals used to clean car engines. so i guess what im trying to say is if it contains ingrediants to clean car engines i guess getting a little oil and dirt off your face is no problem for cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Do you guys know how much one bottle is in the store?? This is a fantastic deal, and each bottle should last you a year, since its so large. I love cetaphil, its simple and basic, just what I wanted. I dont like to rub in fancy chemicals and strong smelling things on my skin, so this is perfect. It does its job- it cleans, and effectively at that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice and gentle cleanser.  Not greasy or thick.  It clears acne and it&#x27;s soap-free, fragrance-free and removes make up very effectively.</li>
            <li> As good as they come!&lt;br /&gt;And at a very attractive price. Gives very cleansing and softening even for non allergic skin</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of layers to get oil or dirt off. The cleanser doesn&#x27;t irritate but water doesn&#x27;t irritate either. Very light and have to wash twice but does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> After trying every cleanser Walmart had. And  trying to get a referral to the dermatologist . A friend of mine took me to massage Envy .This cleanser was referred to me by the Facialist. She said this will not irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m so glad I went and listened to what the lady said.  No more caring about a referral . This cleanser really works !!</li>
            <li> my dermatologist and allergist referred me to this product its the only thing I will wash my face with love it</li>
            <li> So, my doctor recommended this soap as I was having some skin problems (mainly due to tons of exercise and sweating etc).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, he gave me a prescription gel at the same time and indeed, the issue cleared up. However, my skin was very sensitive for a while and I kept getting &#x27;bumps&#x27; that were pretty much under the skin. The bumps would eventually go away but red spots were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;I did not think it could have been the Cetaphil but after some trial and error (I ruled out detergent type, moisturisers, drinking etc etc) I realized that it was the Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;I have now stopped using it and started using a moisturiser again and have had one regular spot in about a month (and none of the painful and annoying under the skin ones).&lt;br /&gt;Just because your doctor reccomends, doesn&#x27;t mean it is right for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for a while and when I bought this I noticed that the consistency and color has changed. While the old formula was clear, the new is cloudy and thicker. I have been using this new formula for a few months now and it does not clean as well any more.</li>
            <li> I constantly have this stuff on hand and I love it! I use it every day to wash my face morning and night. it takes my makeup off well, it is sensitive for the eyes meaning it doesn&#x27;t burn them, and it has never made me break out! I would definitely recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Just perfect to clean my sensitive skin before I go to bed. It also hydrates it. But I still need to use another lotion because I have really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love it so much! When I first used it I was worry that it&#x27;s not clean enough because I wasn&#x27;t used to this type of cleansing,but after I dried my face my skin feel so so SO soft!&lt;br /&gt;I always use cleansing oil before I wash my face if I wear make up [I didn&#x27;t expect it or any face wash to remove my waterproof mascara  or foundation!]&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse the cleansing oil off I&#x27;d apply it on my face and massage for about one and half minutes[watched some beauty guru on YouTube said that if you want your face perfectly clean you should do it at lease 60 seconds.]&lt;br /&gt;I wash it off with warm water followed by cold water[to close the pores] and my face has never been so CLEAN and SOFT.</li>
            <li> Nice product for kid with eczema.  Any kind of harsh product, anti-bacterial soap, etc., exacerbates my son&#x27;s eczema.  I finally ran across this, and it seems to work well for him.  It&#x27;s not good for getting grime off, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it all and will go to the kitchen to use dish soap to get hair product off her hands and things like that.  But, for a child was eczema, it&#x27;s a great everyday cleanser.  Amazon&#x27;s price is fairly good, too.  A 2-pack at about $2 cheaper than my local Target.</li>
            <li> So creamy and moisturizing!!! This face wash cleanses my face withOUT leaving it dry and it is so gentle that you can even use it without water and leave a thin film on your face! The consistency of the wash is like a watered down lotion and it has no scent at all which is great of you don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on your face!</li>
            <li> these came as promised and are my go to face wash in the shower because it&#x27;s so gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> I bought the two pack 20oz bottles from Costco and believe me this cleanser is GREAT, I cannot use fragrance on my face so since this is fragrance-free it made my skin clean and soft. I LOVE IT&gt;</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this is recommended by everyone if you look at the list of ingredients it is just water bad chemicals which is not going to do your skin any good. It must have something to do with the company and big pharma. They say this is gentle enough to use on a baby...never would i put this on my baby or anyone in my family. Your skin needs plant based products.</li>
            <li> My wife use this,and her skin looks so good after she started using it. Its soft and gives  a sense of cleanese.</li>
            <li> As advertised. No hiccups in ordering, payment, or delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel clean when I use it as an alternate to soap. It does, however, moisturize my skin. For me, whike in the shower, I use my soap, whether it be a bar or liquid, and then apply the Cetaphil, let it remain on my skin for a minute or so, rinse off and pay dry.</li>
            <li> I struggled with my skin for 6 months, trying all the harsh products on the market to dry my pimples which made my skin angrier. On day I decided to be gentle and started using Cetaphil in the morning and in the evening I will use it after my foaming cleanser. My skin stopped breaking out!</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work and we have tried it all. The dermatologist recommended this cleanser and we have only used it once and I can see a difference already. His skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> Only recently did I start making a more proactive effort to rid myself of toxic chemicals, in my beauty products, as well as in cleaners for my house etc. Parabens are highly toxic to the body, especially for women. This has three of the worst kinds of Parabens in it, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, and Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just google the word \\&quot;Parabens\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll know why I gave this 1 star. \\&quot;Parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity. Parabens mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells. They also increase the expression of genes usually regulated by estradiol (a natural form of estrogen); these genes cause human breast cancer cells to grow and multiply in cellular studies.\\&quot; Byford JR, Shaw LE, Drew MGB, Pope GS, Sauer MJ, Darbre PD (2002). Oestrogenic activity of parabens in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Journal of Steroid Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology 80:49-60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Methylparaben and Propylparaben. \\&quot;A 2004 UK study detected traces of five parabens in the breast tumors of 19 out of 20 women studied [7]. This small study does not prove a causal relationship between parabens and breast cancer, but it is important because it detected the presence of intact parabens--unaltered by the body&#x27;s metabolism--which is an indication of the chemical&#x27;s ability to penetrate skin and remain in breast tissue. A more recent study found higher levels of one paraben, n-propylparaben, in the axilla quadrant of the breast (the area nearest the underarm) [8]. This is the region in which the highest proportion of breast tumors are found, although paraben concentration in the tissue samples was not related to location of breast tumors in individual women.\\&quot; More good info and applicable citations can be found on this site: safecosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been loyally using this for 10 years, and foolishly ignored the ingredients list. But since I am a women, and have no desire to get breast cancer, I am stopping use of this. Its just not worth the risk. Breast cancer is on the rise and besides the BRAC genes, nothing is 100% certain to cause breast cancer. We only have some factors that can increase your \\&quot;risk.\\&quot; Ex. having your 1st pregnancy after 36, but who really knows. For me, Parabens are not worth the added risk. Especially when its mimicking such a major hormone in my body. I also have just come across a few references indicating it affects fertility too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I read a study where researchers tested the blood and urine of 20 teenage girls, ages 14 to 19, looking for 25 chemicals often found in cosmetics. The teens involved in the study lived in different parts of the country and included white, black, Asian-American, and multiethnic girls. Tests detected 16 chemicals from 4 chemical families in either the blood or urine of the girls. God knows what will happen if you use Parabens for decades, these girls are only 14 and already have lingering carcinogenic agents in them!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA is aware that estrogenic activity in the body is associated with certain forms of breast cancer, however, FD&amp;C Act does not authorize FDA to approve cosmetic ingredients. Thus cosmetic manufacturers may use any ingredient they choose. Which means its up to use to make sure we check the ingredients list, something I didn&#x27;t think to do before. I admit I am disappointed since I first turned to this product after I read celebrities such as Jessica Alba praising this face wash. Someone&#x27;s opinion I regarded more highly then others since she&#x27;s very conscious of what she puts in her body. So I didn&#x27;t think twice when I added it to my regime almost 10 years ago. Now I am I my late 20&#x27;s and wish I never used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take some time breaking away from such highly used carcinogens such as this (I&#x27;ve come to find it everywhere) and go all natural, but it makes all the difference. I have since moved on to something organic, and I do not need to be concerned about harm to my body like with this product. There are lots of great all natural face washes out there that are gentle on the skin without cancer causing agents like BHT, BHA, Parabens, etc. For those who are label conscious this is a good site to refer to; skindeep site, and the Environmental Working Group, as well as the one mentioned above.ed on to something organic, and I do not need to be concerned about harm to my body like with this product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for almost 10 years now. Very good for sensitive skin. Highly recommended product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use - gentle , but if you looking for deep cleaning - probably try something else</li>
            <li> I used to have HORRIBLE acne for 5 years. I went to a doctor and she recommended this, and it works so well! My skin looks so much better! I&#x27;m so glad I got this! I&#x27;m more confident about myself now! Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews on this product and a friend also recommend it for me.  This however made my skin worse- I occasionally get cystic acne (about one cyst every month) that has been the case for many years. But when I used this product for two weeks I ended up with 5-7 at the time of use. And after I stopped using it and my face had healed from that outbreak I am back to the occasional cyst every month or so.  I was not using any other new products so the only component that I believe that could have caused that to happen to me was this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have cystic acne I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used Forever Living&#x27;s aloe soap to clean my face but it was harsh &amp; left my skin extremely dry with years of repeated use. So, I started looking for alternatives. I found this at 2 pack at Costco (it was on sale). I have extremely dry skin especially at the T-zone. But with this cleanser, I have never felt the tightness that I am used to experience after cleansing my face. Also, it has remarkably reduced redness on my face. It does not sting if it enters the eyes, so you can imagine how gentle the formula must be. But, it does a good job at cleansing early morning.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 out of 5 since it&#x27;s not extreme enough to remove face/eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil on a cotton pad first and that removes most of my makeup plus, moisturises my dry skin. And then, I use this Cetaphil cleanser to remove the leftover coconut oil and makeup debris from my face. My skin has improved dramatically with this routine. I have had much less acne/ whiteheads and it&#x27;s made my skin more smooth. I would definitely recommend this regimen along with this cleanser to anyone experiencing adult acne due to makeup/ hormones. As always, consistency is the key. 😀👍🏼</li>
            <li> Very good product。Emulsion texture, very gentle, I love it. Super easy, can be used for a long time，Pump works well and consistently</li>
            <li> Recommended by Vet for my old shitzu&#x27;s problematic skin allergies and sensitivities. We wash with Dawn dishsoap first if there are fleas then this and he is doing great. Still doesn&#x27;t care for baths tho.</li>
            <li> Love this. My face feels very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s basic and affordable.  I haven&#x27;t used anything else for the past 25 years--I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling nice and clean!</li>
            <li> If a person has not used this cleanser they are missing the best.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Cetaphil because I have semi-sensitive skin but no acne, at first the product seemed amazing but after about 4 days it began to irritate my skin and leave dry itchy red patches on my skin. It irritated my skin so much I had to give up all facial products together! The products I used to use burned like crazy on my face. I tried everything to fix it and it only makes it worse. Also when I read the back I realized the stuff is LOADED with alcohol, which is awful for your skin and dries it out. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. It may work for some but to me it&#x27;s not worth the risk. My skin still is irritated after a week of no products whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of face cleanser for 20 years now.  And, of course, Amazon&#x27;s price makes it even better!</li>
            <li> My children and myself suffer from extremely sensitive (and dry) skin.  My dermatologist recommended we use this in place of all soaps.  We have never looked back.  Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for teens and adults.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin or clog pores.  Even great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> It is not painful when washing cracked hands with this product, and it seems to moisturize my hands well.  I typically use it at the end of the day because its hard to do &amp;#34;manly things&amp;#34; like grip a jar and open it with slightly slippery hands. I am sure I will use a ton when it is colder and my hands are cracked worse!</li>
            <li> Great product for all ages! My granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist specifically wanted her to start using when she was 3yrs old, her skin immediately looked soft, healthy, not dry or greasy. Now my daughter and her husband use as well! PS, I&#x27;m 65 &amp; buy for my home as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Cetaphil for two days, and so far, my face is noticeably softer. I love how fresh my face feels after a good cleanse. It smells great and feels light. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this great in a long time, and that was only from two days of use! I look forward to using this whole line of skincare products!</li>
            <li> This product is just not for me. I have very oily and blemished skin and I feel like it does not wash a way the dirt on my face at all. I like my cleansers to foam and feel like it is doing something, but this cleanser has a watery lotion feel to it that is a little uncomfortable for me. I finished one bottle and I am half way finishing the other one and I see no difference on my skin whatsoever or see any improvements. Shame, I really wanted this product to work because of all the great reviews it has here, but my skin got used to the harsh cleansers first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years. It&#x27;s so gentle and washes off quickly and easily. Leaves skin feeling clean and soft and does not dry out my skin. I get suckered into trying other more expensive options and always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the normal to oily but my mistake. This standard soap is super gentle. Not sure it does the job I need it to.</li>
            <li> Recommend to all skin types. Especially sensitive skin. Non-irritating cleanser but make skin feel soft and clean. Wil keepi using this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and its amazing!  It leaves my skin soft and I have had hardly any pimples since using this.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I stop using harsh cleansers with salicylic acid because they were drying out my skin and actually making my acne worse.  It was hard to break the habit of wanting that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; skin feeling, but Cetaphil helped significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you skin feel smooth, clean, and soft.  It&#x27;s very mild and my skin is much less oily and my pores look much smaller after I use Cetaphil.  My breakouts have cleared up tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this to wash my underarms as well, because in the past I&#x27;ve had issues with eczema after shaving.  Using this in combination with &amp;#34;Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Cream&amp;#34; and Cerave moisturizer has completely eliminated the issues I was having previously.</li>
            <li> pretty good. pretty pretty good. i like it, its gently yet its effective enough to get all the dirt and grime off my face slaving away at work while my wife sits at home doing god knows what... but not cleaning for sure... she leaves that for me when i get home from working all day. i get ridiculed if i try to buy my own facial wash so when i finally ran out of mine... in attempt to save myself from the ridicule of wanting to but something for myself i decided to use hers which was this stuff and its pretty good. not as harsh or tough as my other stuff but if i rub it into my face for long enough it seems to work.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser !</li>
            <li> cetaphil is like the best lotion on planet earth.  enough said.  it sjust plain legit.  super good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> i ordered a cleanser got lotion instead</li>
            <li> Love it! very gentle and comfortabl and I use it every morning. Such price for pack two, it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and tends to produce breakouts easily and so I bought this hoping it will lessen if not eliminate the breakouts. So far, I don&#x27;t see any good progress in terms of the number of breakouts disappearing, but whenever I use this it leaves a smooth feeling on my face. The scent is also good.</li>
            <li> This skin cleanser is just like you can buy in the stores but is cheaper as a 2-pack. Bottles are just like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil exclusively as a facial cleanser for 20 years on the advice of a dermatologist.  I have sensitive skin and have never been happy with my complexion (mostly blotchy redness).  I&#x27;ve changed everything else a million times over the years and never even considered the Cetaphil as part of the problem since a Dr. recommended it.  When I started investigating particular ingredients, I was shocked and sad to find that Cetaphil contains SEVERAL suspected irritants. I changed a few months ago and I think I am seeing a difference, at the very least I am certain it is not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to see so many people having good luck with this, wish I were one of them.</li>
            <li> For those that enjoy putting sulfates and parabens on their face, go ahead and use this junk.  Does anyone realize that SLS is used to clean car and truck engines? Its also used as an industrial floor cleaner?  Do your homework people.  Stay away from this crap.</li>
            <li> I was refereed to this product by my dermatologist. I feel in love with it. This product was created for people with \\&quot;special\\&quot; skin needs aka  for those with sensitive, acne, rosacea, or eczema skin. I find this product is suitable for ANYONE. It will not strip your skin of moisture (especially when you need it like in winter). It does take some getting used to. IT has been related to a snot consistency :P That is pretty accurate. It will not lather with water. I find the BEST way to use it is simply to apply it and spread it all over the area you wish to cleanse(not just for the face but neck and Décolletage) and simply wipe it off with a bath facial towel. No water needed, but optional:P Super time saving and non-messy(well not not splashy) Also important it is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic and PH balanced. This product has been around for ever, its nothing fancy or snazzy , just simply the best, time tested,  and DR approved.

            <li> just what it says.  for all skin types.  perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years after a Canadian broadcaster I knew told me it was the secret to her beautiful skin along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Cleans skin without stripping it. Removes make up too.</li>
            <li> This used to be the best cleanser. The last two that I&#x27;ve purchased (not here on Amazon, but at a large chain store) were either bad batches, or Cetaphil changed the formula. Had to throw them both out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of being the really nice, gentle but effective, transparent cleanser that it had been for years, what I got was a milky paste with no soap and no cleansing qualities whatsoever. Just paste, zero cleansing ability. Terribly disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I could ever put on my skin.  I am extremely fair and it immediately made me break out in a rash.  My skin was so red.  It blistered and hurt.  It is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely will purchase more. It is extremely gentle on skin and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> recommended by my kids&#x27; dermatologist.  works great!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is my absolute favorite. It&#x27;s so gentle on the skin, which is a must because my skin is crazy sensitive. I also use this for shaving - as shaving creams can really kill my skin.</li>
            <li> I still prefer my soap.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin for a long period and they look young and smooth when I apply it every day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to be dry, so I have to be very careful about what I use as cleansers and moisturizers.  I love this cleanser.  It is very gentle, I started using it when my daughter was born - she had baby eczema and needed a very soothing wash.  This was perfect for her skin condition, and I started to use it when I ran out of my own cleanser and found that it was wonderful for my skin.  I think I keep the company in business just with my purchases.  I think this would be great for any type of skin, but if you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend it.  For those who have sensitive skin and need a great moisturizer, especially if you are looking for a great anti-aging cream, in my travels through sensitive territory I found [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]].  It&#x27;s all natural, gentle, and the oils in the cream really transform your skin.  I had scaly, grey skin on my elbows and hands and within a week of using the cream, the difference was huge, and after about 6 weeks, my elbows and hands are as soft as my 3-year old&#x27;s.  This cleanser and the cream have made a complete difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After getting so many comments on how great my skin looked, I took a good look in the mirror, and saw that the lines on my face from sunbathing so much (I don&#x27;t do that hardly at all any more), are so much better.  The lines on my forehead are so much lighter and the lines at the corner of my eyes are hardly noticeable.  Just goes to show that natural and gentle can work just as well as heavy duty treatments!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this has been the best face wash for me! It is gentle and non-drying. Also, there is no strong odor (who wants to smell something strong right on their face all day??)</li>
            <li> I have problem skin so must be extremely careful what products I use.  My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil and it has been a god-sent.  It does not cause overall redness,  redness nor clogged pores.  It also leaves your skin soft without being greasy.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer makes my face feel good while it lasts. I live in Arizona the dry temperatures here make my skin feel dry too. The cetaphil does not last the whole day. My skin will feel dry about halfway through the day. If I reapply during the day my face will look greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I use it twice a day on my combination/oily skin. It&#x27;s really helped a lot with breakouts in a way that no other cleanser has been able to do for me. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> way too gentle. makes your skin feel like you didn&#x27;t do anything to it. didn&#x27;t clear my acne either.</li>
            <li> I think cetaphil changed their cleanser because when i used it a while ago it used to lather up but now its kind of like a lotion. It doesnt feel like im cleaning my skin but i hope its doing something.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle cleanser especially for my sunburnt skin which may feel some stinging when washed with other soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my infant who has baby acne. A bonus is that I love it too for my facial wash. While it hasn&#x27;t cleared it all up, I am more comfortable using this on his face and neck because it is a very gentle cleanser. This is also a great price!</li>
            <li> This has become my facial cleaner stop using the soap and notice a big difference in the way my face look and feel</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin that peels, so I need something neutral like this to just remove dirt and oil. Very mild, but I do feel a difference from just using water. Does wash away makeup.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s one thing I hate paying for, it&#x27;s soap. That said, I stick with economy-sized bottles Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile in the shower, and I stick with SnS Cetaphil for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: I hate the smell of the Daily Facial Cleanser stuff from Cetaphil, and bought it by accident once, thinking it would also be unscented. From that point on, I&#x27;ve used this - the Skin Cleanser - on my face. Scent free is the way to be, baby.</li>
            <li> okay, i never had teen acne, not even in my 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;m 33 now. I started breaking out 2 years ago in January and I have purchased COUNTLESS products (mostly from Amazon because of the reviews) to treat the acne. I mean rose water, putting sandalwood powder, potato skins, lemon juice, masks, peels, all the &#x27;acids&#x27; that they sell on this site to fight the acne scars, pills, man you name it. I bought this Cetaphil gentle cleanser 4 weeks ago and my acne .... just ..... stopped. I use it when I shower, then use Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturing Lotion while my face is semi-wet after the shower. Trust me, this has been an ef&#x27;d up journey that has somewhat zapped me of my self-esteem and confidence and Cetaphil, thus far, has pulled through. I&#x27;ll update if it fails. Like Drake, y&#x27;all can Thank Me Later :) One.     D from Cerritos, Cali</li>
            <li> I love this wash, its very gently on my skin and does not cause breakouts or clog my pores. Its perfect if you just need to clean your skin but you do not want something too strong on the skin. I also noticed it dries the skin out sometimes and causes flaking, so its helping me remove some of that dead skin on the surface. You should always use a lotion along with this after using it because of the drying. Good product though.</li>
            <li> i guess I&#x27;ll have to throw out my Dollar Store cream. My dermatologist said this was best and it stopped my itching after long pool sessions. Better deal at COSTCO however at $15.95 for 2 20 OZ containers and it was with a $4 discount this month.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this cleanser because it kept my skin so soft. But after a couple of weeks I started getting bumps all over my forehead and upper cheeks and even my neck, places I never get blemishes on. I had no idea it was the cleanser until I decided to look on the net to see if anyone had the same experience and I found a few people who reacted the same way. I was surprised after reading the reviews. I stopped using it and treated the blemishes with DDF 5% benzoyl peroxide which is an amazing product. Switched back to water and aveeno positively radiant cleansing pads.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe a cleanser could do that to my face. Took 2 weeks to recover.  Did not work for me at all. Will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> i like the fact that cetaphil is a gentle non-soap cleanser. it can be used with or without water, i prefer waterless method when i&#x27;m all in a hurry or very tired to do my night facial regimen.  given with its gentleness, however I do get rash-like bumps lately which never happened in my previous years of being a cetaphil user before.. i dunno how that happened, but i think my skin&#x27;s telling me to move on with another product. so long, cetaphil.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I purchased the bigger 2-pack after trying a smaller bottle by one of the sellers on Amazon. I use it once a day with very cold water. It leaves my skin feeling super soft. I have noticed that using some kind of moisturizer after cleansing is necessary for me.</li>
            <li> What a great facial cleaner. Great for every everyone and skin types (from oily, to normal, to combination skin.)  Will not over dry skin. Gentle enough for around the and and lash area.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser as directed by my dermatologist for years. It is very gentle and does not dry out your skin. My complexion is consitently clear. This is a great value as well!</li>
            <li> THE BEST CLEANSER FOR THE FACE</li>
            <li> People let me tell you about my bestfriend!! Cetaphil is amazing! I never had serious acne, always an occasional zit or two but nothing serious. Well, when I came home for the summer that all changed. I don&#x27;t know what caused it but I had bumps, pimples and black heads all over my forehead. There were also random bumps on the right side of my face. I tried everything that I had before. I tried popping, clean and clear (which worked before but suddenly couldn&#x27;t tackle the issue I was having) and astringent. Nothing worked. I kept seeing the Cetaphil commercials on TV so I tried it. It has changed my life!! I saw improvement in a week!! (People w acne know how big of a deal that is) I also swear by this product because, my forehead had a lot of dark spots (where I was popping and for reasons I&#x27;m not sure of) and Cetaphil has cleared those up too!! This product is amazing. My routine may be a little different than others though. First off, I use it twice a day. In the morning AFTER I workout (when I wake up, I just rinse my face and I use the product after I workout to clean my open pores... at least that&#x27;s what I think it does lol), and I use it before I go to sleep. But I put the product on an exfoliating spin brush (just your basic one) and scrub my face (gently) for at least a minute, then I wash the rest of my body and rinse the product off as the very last step. When I use it in the morning, I scrub my face and leave it on until after I&#x27;m through brushing my teeth. I just figure, to really work the product should sit on my face a little. I also use the lotion offered by cetaphil but only in the morning, never before I go to sleep. If you&#x27;re skeptical of the product, I encourage you to relax and give it 7 days.. you have nothing to lose!!</li>
            <li> I have a lung condition that requires me to use oxygen constantly. The oxygen suppliers do not want oil or petroleum based products near the breathing tubes. The doctors do not want me to use soap. The cetaphil lotion is the answer-it is very soothing and cool. The pump dispenser negates having to manipulate the container itself. It comes as a package of two and one needs two-one in bath and one on wash basin..I am very pleased with the product and will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I was introduced 30 years ago in the office of a dermatologist.  Still not a better product on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a surprise that this i the best cleanser in the world - dermatologists all recommend it!  Soft and thorough.</li>
            <li> Was not sealed and smelled like something else other that the Cetaphil I was used to using.</li>
            <li> Loooovce it! Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> the product is great! Once I started using this, I just couldn&#x27;t choose other brands. Cetaphil is much cheaper compared to some brand names. However, I don&#x27;t think it is cheaper to shop online. I highly recommend you to buy them in grocery store, they are much cheaper there. The reason why I shop at Amazon is because I am too lazy to go to the store.</li>
            <li> This product may work but it contains parabens! parabens are extremly toxic and cause cancer! When using this product you are rubbing toxic cancer causing chemicals on your face and body.  Parabens also are estrogen-mimicking chemicals and may be a factor in the increasing prevalence of early puberty in girls and hormonal imbalances in boys.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser was recommended to me by a dermatologist for skin irritations and itching. Now, this is the only facial wash that I will use. My teenage son starting using it also, and says it helps with his mild acne.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my Clarisonic Plus system and I really like it.  I will say that as a female who wears cosmetics sometimes its best to take off the eye makeup first before washing because this product doesn&#x27;t lather so I feel like I am just pushing it around too much if I don&#x27;t wipe off the excess makeup first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generic versions of this are just as good, and that is usually what I stick with if I don&#x27;t have a coupon.</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types..cleans and rinses well, with no residue left behind. I can clean my eye make-up with ease, and no burning. An absolute must, especially for sensitive or combination skin. Great Price for 2 in a pack.</li>
            <li> Been using it for several months and have noticed a definite difference! Skin is cleaner and softer, and has worked as stated. Glad I purchased it, recommend for anyone and already have :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and good smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a smart purchase then I did extreme research on facial washing. This stuff is loaded with alcohol, so it dries your face out. I have oily skin, so this stuff upped my sebum production by a large amount causing me to break out. I know they skate by on brand recognition, but I have no allegiance to them. I am only aligned with what works for my skin. In this instance, their alcohol caused issues for my face which means I pass on their products. If they decide to reformulate with something better, I might give it another go.</li>
            <li> For years I used Philosophy&#x27;s cleanser which is costly. A friend recommended I try Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser and I was amazed at how great it leaves my skin feeling at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago. I am a huge fan. I have used it on my babies, and little kids, around the eyes,,, everywhere. Never once have it given me a rash or an allergy. Excellent cream.</li>
            <li> I have very senstitive skin and some very visible allergy responses.  This product is wonderful.  So soothing to skin that irritates easily.  I love that this product is so easy to use. I have been using this product for a month now and see quite an improvement in my skin on my face and hands.  Redness is much less a problem and my skin is so much more soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m glad to have discovered this and that now it is shipped directly to my door on an automated schedule.</li>
            <li> (For my review of the Cleanser, skip to the end of this review please.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is a GREAT product that I cannot do without, so that&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;I however, received from Amazon 2 bottles of Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion.  If you use Cetaphil products, you know that these two products look Exactly alike (except for the &amp;#34;Cleanser&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; on the bottles).  Even though I know better, I didn&#x27;t examine it well enough before opening it.  I&#x27;ve purchased this before and many other items and have never had a single problem with Amazon until now.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were in a sealed plastic bag with the product label &amp;#34;Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2).&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t notice it was lotion and removed the packaging.  It wasn&#x27;t until I placed the bottle in my bathroom that I saw it was the wrong product!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t open the bottle/pump (and the second bottle remains shrink-wrapped), but I pretty much knew it was too late to return it, which is unfortunate since I don&#x27;t use this lotion and am on an extremely tight budget and purchased the Cleanser only because I Really Needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for reviews on the Cleanser, I can say that it is the best soap/cleanser I have ever used.  It&#x27;s scentless, the texture is neither thick nor too thin, it is extremely Gentle while thoroughly cleaning the most sensitive or problematic skin (also great on wounded or irritated skin), does not overdry or leave your skin with any feeling except Clean and soft.  I recommend using this especially if you are looking for a product to use on: cuts, sores, sensitive areas, dry skin, children, elderly, acne, oily skin (no matter how much you use, it won&#x27;t cause dryness or peeling), eyes (it does not irritate the eyes), and to remove makeup.  Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face when I realized that all facial cleansers/soaps were irritating the heck out of my skin with harsh and excessive ingredients and giving me the acne. I used it dutifully for a year or so, with relatively good results. Then I got sort of lazy and stopped washing my face with any cleanser at all. No change. Perhaps even an improvement. Ok so maybe I was just growing out of adolescence, maybe this stuff helped wean me off of that commercial face cleanser b.s, OR this is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These companies have us all trembling in fear that there is a never ending  buildup of oils, \\&quot;impurities,\\&quot; and dirt on our skin that we need to pulverize constantly. I applaud this product for being nice about it (and not using sensationalist marketing). But it makes me wonder...if using a gentler product is better, then why use anything at all? Dirt and oils are the natural state of skin, which humans have lived with forever. They can&#x27;t be all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely has a place, and I recommend it. But for general sensitive skin you might want to see if you even need it.</li>
            <li> i tried a lot of cleansers , they were way too strong for my skin, so my dermatologist told me to use this one and so far it really works ....</li>
            <li> everybody say this is good. bought pack of 2. one for my friend. but i still do not feel it can wash my face clean enough!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and confused by this product. I have the daily facial cleanser and love it. This feels like trying to wash your skin with lotion, as in It doesn&#x27;t lather at all and looks/feels like straight up lotion. I triple checked the bottle to make sure I hadn&#x27;t received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I use cetaphil for my son.this is the only cleaner soap he lets me wash hin with.&lt;br /&gt;l use cetaphil as a shaving cream.it really works better then regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so finding a good cleanser that does not dry out my skin or give me hives from scent added is an issue. I use this cleanser every time I shower and it works great! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Sams club 2 for 16 for the 20 oz bottles. This price is pretty insane... good stuff bad price</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry and sensitive skin.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now. I&#x27;m convinced that this is the best facial cleanser on the market. It&#x27;s clear and has a clinical scent (not in a bad way) that gives the impression of quality equal to hospital-grade soap. I was hooked after the first use and have since been totally satisfied with the results. My complexion is clearer than it&#x27;s ever been (I&#x27;m 51) and I&#x27;ve been troubled by acne all my life! Wish I found this stuff 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware &amp;#34;Wallmarket&amp;#34; equals, they are NOT the same. It&#x27;s not even close!</li>
            <li> it is appropriate to my sensitive skin type. And it can clean my face very well. the best cleanser I have used</li>
            <li> Normal soap and detergents cause painful, itchy and unsightly eczema on my skin.  This product has been a life saver for me.  Gently cleans and no eczema.</li>
            <li> Keeps irritation down</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive I can&#x27;t use anything to clean my face with.  This is the only one I can use on real hard working days for moisture.</li>
            <li> Feels good, feels nice and clean lovesss it ! can use it twice a day feels real gentle yup yup</li>
            <li> Bought for some one else-really can&#x27;t review</li>
            <li> A doctor had recommended this to me for a while, so I decided to try it. Took a shower, used it, and to my surprise my skin felt as if it were burning and I actually began to itch so hard I bled. Horrified, I jumped back into the shower and tried to wash it off with very cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never recommend this to any of my friends with eczema.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Y A UN MUY BUEN PRECIO, EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y RAPIDO, RECOMENDACION PARA TODOS LOS COMPRADORES EN COMPRAR ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for probably 10-15 years (wow, that was a depressing thing to type).  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive face washes from Sephora and department store cosmetic counters, but I always switch back to Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin--I once had what was supposed to be a facial specifically for sensitive skin and broke out into nasty hives that required a steroid shot--and this is not irritating whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled a bit with acne in my late teens, early 20s, and it turned out that the problem was that I was using much too harsh of products that were exacerbating the problem.  Cetaphil helps combat bacteria that causes acne but does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my primary skin concern has turned from acne to preventing wrinkles (I am in my early 30s), I still rely on Cetaphil thanks to how gentle it is.  I don&#x27;t worry that I&#x27;m stripping my skin when I wash my face.  And I now use Cetaphil in conjunction with a Clarisonic (delicate skin brush), since Cetaphil&#x27;s only negative is that it has absolutely no exfoliating capability whatsoever, and I think exfoliation is really important for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say don&#x27;t bother buying expensive face washes--put your money towards a really quality moisturizer instead--and stick with this classic cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is the bomb.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My face is completely clear of acne so much more confident now because of this stuff</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that limits my options for cleansers.  This product gets me clean, keeps my skin soft, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my 2 month old daughter. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> NICE EASY to use cleanser.....Good size bottle.....2pack....prided right......Good quality product......</li>
            <li> Love this product...I have used it for years and my 5 children use it-4 of which are teenagers.  None of us have ever had a problem with breakouts or acne.  We also use it as a make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I have worked for numerous Plastic Surgeons and Dermatologists and this is the one cleanser they agree on for everyone across the board. This is ph balanced, gentle and effective. Spend your money on serums and anti aging creams. A cleanser should not be expensive. This size Cetaphil should last you a year if you use it twice a day. Apply to dry skin and rinse off. I use mine with a clarisonic face brush. I have great skin. I will never wash my face with anything else. Ladies, if you use this, use a makeup remover wipe first to remove water proof and eye makeup. This will remove all traces after. Great, buy it. Don&#x27;t buy generic, different ingredients and lower quality.&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on the recommendation of friends who love it.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, it felt heavy and oily to me. I have fairly sensitive skin and it definitely produced itchy red bumps on my face.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was incredulous that something so widely used could cause me problems, but I stopped using it and the rash went away.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a jar of Pond&#x27;s cold cream, which my mother always used when I was little, and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.&lt;br /&gt;The product might work for some people but it was definitely not right for me.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is an OKAY at best cleanser for someone with no acne looking for a LIGHT cleanser. Cetaphil has the same PH as your skin, which means it has the same PH as water. Which means you are pretty much just washing your face with water. It is a waste of money! My dermatologist told me this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle face cleaner that washes off my make up and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin. I am going to use this face wash for years to come, if not for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> it is really good product for sensitive skin and also, it washes very clean</li>
            <li> At 40 I developed oddly sensitive skin - not rosacea.  I tried Clinique and other brands intended to calm the skin with no effect - or they made it worse.  I tried Cetaphil after seeing it recommended in a magazine.  It calmed my skin, didn&#x27;t dry it out and I barely ever get pimples anymore.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and years. I tend to defer to most high end, expensive products. No need in this department. This is a drug store product that&#x27;s inexpensive. But it&#x27;s perfect. Win-win! I use a scub on occasion (once or twice a week) as well. But for daily cleansing, this is wonderful. I have always had dry skin, and this is wonderful for me. You can even use it to remove non-stubborn makeup on your eyes. It&#x27;s super gentle and does not irritate the eye. You can used with a cloth to wipe off, or with water. I prefer water to feel totally clean, but it&#x27;s good to know, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half pump is more than sufficient for the entire face and neck. I would estiamte a bottle lasts me close to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more tip. I tried the drugstore brand once a few years back. Stick with the real McCoy. Like I said, it&#x27;s cheap to begin with compared to many others. Unlike many generics, the knockoff did not perform the same.</li>
            <li> I discovered and tried Cetaphil some years ago, and have been using it daily ever since.  As an older woman, I need a product that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is gentle and effective.  Happy to have found Cetaphil, which is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, but dry skin.  I usually buy this cleanser at my local BJ&#x27;s wholesale club, but they have been out of stock lately.  So, was glad to have an alternate place to purchase.</li>
            <li> Its alright. Have been using it on my daughter n it seems to be turning ok. She doesnt have as bad dried skin as she used to anymore which is good.</li>
            <li> Wash your face very clean, and there is no burden. Used several bottles of these cleanser, very good and like it very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good to use in winter.  I just can&#x27;t stand the oil face, so i wash my face many times a day. This cleanser is good since it won&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great facewash.  It is very gentle and leaves my face feelings very clean, but not too dry.</li>
            <li> For so many years, I had used the anti-acne face washes. I used Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Proactive, etc. I was sick of how tight and dry my skin was feeling. Afer washing my face with these cleansers, my face would feel clean but totally stripped of moisture. I am 33 and my skin was starting to get dry and look \\&quot;old\\&quot;. I was so afraid to try anything moisturizing because I feared it would make me break out. I finally tried Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and I am in love! My skin feels so soft and happy when I use it. It feels great on my skin and since I started using it a little over a week ago, I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes. My face feels very calm and supple. I think the face wash I was using (which contained salycilic acid) was just too much for my skin to take and it would get irritated and then break out. The Cetaphil keeps my skin balanced and calm which I think has kept it clear. All I do day and night is wash with the Cetaphil cleanser and then put on my Rapid Clear moisturizer by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for myself but never used it because it doesn&#x27;t have any suds and I couldn&#x27;t get past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 11 year old started breaking out all over the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area of his face. I gave him this product and it half cleared up over night. He didn&#x27;t use it the next day and it came back immediately. He&#x27;s now been using it for 3 or 4 days in a row and his face has completely cleared up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so awesome so see such fast results, especially in the case of an 11 year old boy. Now I know I won&#x27;t have to hassle him to wash his face, he has seen the immediate results for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for over five years and my face was still constantly broken out.  I switched to Cetaphil and my face was clear within a month.  I had to give it time for the Proactiv medicines to get out of my system - I felt like my skin became dependent on it even though there was a lack of results.  Also I highly recommend the Cetaphil moisturizer.  I always thought my skin was so oily so I hardly moisturized, then I read an article that said oily skin can be caused by this.  The Cetaphil products have been the best!  I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and finally am acne free!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff i used it the moment it got to me which was very quick. I works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on my baby when her regular soap was drying her skin during the winter months.  This is a gentle cleanser that, while not specifically intended for babies, still provides soft suds that don&#x27;t hurt if they get in the eyes.  It&#x27;s non-drying and has a light pleasant scent.  It rinses clean.  In fact, when I ran out of my face wash, I started using this and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Water, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; are the above listed, however, they are common in many products. Sodium Lauryl Sulphate is a harsh surfacant, Propylene gylcol is a KNOWN skin irritant. Obviously there is a lot of alcohol too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parabens are all preservatives and the most disturbing. Methyparaben is known to cause breast cancer AND&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The October 3, 2006, issue of Toxicology published a study that shows when skin treated with creams that contain methylparaben was exposed to the sun&#x27;s UVB rays, the skin cells died and there was considerable oxidative stress on the skin&#x27;s tissue. Oxidative stress, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is responsible for a number of disease processes, including cancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re male and you THINK you&#x27;re safe think again&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Parabens, including methylparaben, have estrogenic affects on the body, which means they can affect the reproductive glands. The January 2009 issue of Reproductive Toxicology reports that there is a probable interaction between parabens and the health and activity of cells in the testes, meaning a possible decrease in sperm production in males.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this due to my sensitive skin. I have never displayed an allergy to ANYTHING skin related before I just have a bit of dryness from some products. I dont have many allergies, and certainly not skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Cetaphil bars in the past with little concern. I figured liquid wash might be better. But I turned into a puffy looking lobster color anywhere it touched within 2 min of rinsing. I had to spend 24 hours inside until my skin calmed and take benadryl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reaction confused my dermatologist tremendously as he recommends cetaphil to his patients with allergies. He said there must be some questionable ingredients within Cetaphil cleanser. This is the point I looked the above information up, and although I quoted Livestrong for information I found many instances and actual case studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left flabbergasted. Just beware that even though its marked \\&quot;mild\\&quot; thats due to it not having fragrance, and there are some harsh, potentially dangerous ingredients inside. I personally ended up moving onto home made, unscented cold process soap for my face.ients within Cetaphil cleanser.

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this! I recently started Isotretinoin (Accutane), and this has been the only face wash I&#x27;ve been able to use without my skin getting a sharp prickling sensation. The absolute best thing I&#x27;ve found for my recently sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin and it is not drying. It also hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs. Don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner!</li>
            <li> I never understood the hype behind this product, until I started using it regularly during a particularly bad break-out. This product is unique in that the ONLY thing it does is clean your skin. It does not bombard your skin with the typical anti-acne products, or drying perfumes, or pore-clogging materials. Sadly, 99% of products do contain all those things and more, but Cetaphil sticks with a basic, simple formula which works well for my skin. This was somewhat of a shock to me because I have always liked the feeling of face washes that tingle and take the oil off of my face, but now I realize that these were doing nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin. I have eczema and I am really glad I found Cetaphil products. My skin is showing much improvement.</li>
            <li> i have been using cetaphil since the 90s.  i love it.  it is gentle on your skin and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  it takes a while to get used to it as it doesn&#x27;t leave your face with that stripped, dry feeling, but it&#x27;s clean.  i highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive, aging skin…</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a facial cleanser for over 5 years and keep coming back to it. I&#x27;ve tried other products for sensitive skin (like Simple and St. Ives) but I like Cetaphil best because it&#x27;s gentle and prevents me from breaking out. I have oily skin but realized a few years ago that sensitive products help keep my skin clear far better than products for oily skin. It&#x27;s not great at removing makeup, but most cleansers that can take off your makeup without a washcloth tend to be harsh. I&#x27;ve recently started using Cetaphil as a shave gel with a simple, cheap two-blade razor with no moisture strip because my legs become very irritated by shaving in the winter, and it has worked wonders. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have super dry sensative skin, But im a teenager so i also breakout. I have been using St ives apricot scrub everyday, and that just tore up my skin. So i tried a lot of all natural facial cleansers that just sucked. I even tried makeing my own -_-&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this tonight and used it in the shower and for the first time in a long time i felt like my skin wasnt being stripped.&lt;br /&gt;It burns a little, Idk why, but it made my face feel clean and soft. I also use St ives Green Tea Scrub once a week or whenever I have heavy makeup to take off. I reccomend that for people who need something tough to take off the grime without irritating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also my mom use to use Cetaphil on me when i was little because i had bad dry red skin, I think it was excema.</li>
            <li> The good ratings give it away. Cetaphil makes a soft and gentle product worth of the title it bestows. This is a great deal for the two-pack and may last you a long time with varied use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this isn&#x27;t the daily facial cleanser, which I think is a bit more potent, but this gentle skin cleanser will do the trick for the face.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that my skin allows. It&#x27;s gentle, non-scented, and doesn&#x27;t have *any* harsh ingredients to aggravate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended switching to Cetaphil. It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, so your skin won&#x27;t need to produce more oil and cause acne. This combined with prescribed Differin helped clear up my skin. Works really well for everyday use</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used numerous cleansers - the realization that I&#x27;ve come to is that less is more. Anything with harsh ingredients ends up drying out my skin, causing it to compensate by oiling up even more, leading to more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried Cetaphil, which is so gentle it feels like it isn&#x27;t doing anything. Having used solely Cetaphil for the past 5 years, my skin has been spotless for the same amount of time. I need less moisturizer, and my skin feels great all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t, and don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist . Excellent product. I only wish this would have been available or suggested years ago...I am sure my skin would be in better condition. The moisturizer lotion &amp; cream are also, excellent for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Cetaphil by my dermatologist. It provides exactly what the product describes - a gentle cleanse. I&#x27;m pleased with the product so far and look forward to continued positive results to my face and body.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and found that this price is almost as if you are getting two for price of one. Very Pleased....</li>
            <li> All Cetaphil products provided excellent skin care -- the soap, liquid cleanser, daily ultra hydrating lotion. I recommend all of them!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist remmonded Cetaphil. He told me he \\&quot;wasnt a salesman\\&quot; he just recommended this product to his patients. I have very sensitive skin. I am a busy nurse and allergic to alot of things.....I have issues with plastics, some plants and sometimes just about everything. I have a bottle at work to wash my face when my skin rashes come up. I have a container of container of gentle wash in each of my bathrooms. I travel alot and always take it with me when I go.  I like the gentle wash much better than the daily wash it is less soapy and rinses much easier.</li>
            <li> I developed Rosacea a couple years ago. The ugly acne like &#x27;breakouts&#x27; kept me from leaving the house all too often. I tried a lot of different things to no avail. My sister had gotten a tiny bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser when she was in the hospital. She gave it to me and I tried it on my face. I began to see a difference in a couple of days. After I used that little bottle up, I&#x27;ve been purchasing it and have used nothing else to wash my face with for months. Have not had one serious case of the ugly red pustules since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;It has not helped my dry skin (also a recent development)and I even use the Cetaphil lotion after cleansing. Hope this might help someone else dealing with rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. As a result, I have seen a number of dermatologists over the years. This is always the product that was recommended to me and it truly is the best. I have been using it since my teens and am not in my 20s. It is non-irritating and allows for a smooth clean. Would never use anything else!</li>
            <li> The cetaphil 2 pack came in a small package at my doorstep this morning, I opened the box and white oozing liquid started flooding onto my brand new levi jeans i just put on for 5 minutes and thus ruining them, not only that but the cetaphil bottles were completely empty because they happen to have leaked all in the box. So I payed 18$ for a product only to not receive it properly and causing damage to another product(MY BRAND NEW LEVI JEANS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON &#x3D; FAIL, FAIL, FAIL and FAIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAIL.</li>
            <li> I look at a lot of reviews in regards to the ingredients used in this products. The ingredients balance out to make a good combination for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say that with any facial cleanser (especially if you are using this to clear up acne, blemishes, etc) prepare for your FACE to get worst before getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped me for years. I will say that I switch it up so often as we should all change up hygiene products after awhile. However, this product is very consistent with what it says. I use it for all my clients. It is a healthy cleanse. I use this right before I exfoliate. If you want to take care of your face, this is a product to use early in the morning and late at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest reading the ingredients before buying, you can be possibly allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will leave your face feeling smooth and soft. It is apart of my skin regimen. Especially if you are a makeup lover such as myself this is definitely the product made for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleanses gently, easy to use around the eyes because it does not sting at all if you get some in your eyes. I use it when shaving my legs, and think it would work well for shaving faces, too, especially for anyone with acne- it provides the lubrication you need for the blade without drying or irritating the skin. I have used it for washing scrapes for my son who always insists that it&#x27;s going to hurt and then admits that with Cetaphil, it doesn&#x27;t. I even use it when my dog develops skin irritations on her belly! So gentle, cleanses effectively- great stuff!</li>
            <li> FINALLY A FACE WASH THAT MAKES ME EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even made my password Cetaphil for a while.. it&#x27;s THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I suffered from underground pimples and black heads due to terrible face washes.  I have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN (I can&#x27;t even eat spicy food, otherwise I look like a tomato) so it was hard to find a face wash that worked. I used everything from Neutrogena to L&#x27;Oreal and it either made me too greasy, dry, or didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered Cetaphil.  I don&#x27;t really remember when it first happened, but man am I super pumped I did.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and my face loves it.  It even can be a great body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a plain cleanser, no complicated ingredients.  I use this before I go to bed, and also have an extra in the shower for the mornings.  I do NOT recommend using it as a makeup remover.  I use \\&quot;Maybelline Expert Eyes\\&quot; Makeup remover and that works well with it (I also have sensitive eyes that get rashy if I use the wrong product, and I don&#x27;t have any issues with this one).</li>
            <li> I have tried every product imaginable including sticking my hands directly in a vaseline jar and then wearing gloves to bed because of my skin cracking and blistering during the colder months. Two years ago my new Dermatologist recommended all Cetaphil products. Their gentle skin cleanser and Restoraderm skin restoring moisturizer are the best.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list alone should put you off this product. It&#x27;s basically, water, alcohol, and three parabens. Paraben laced lotion is not going to clean your face. I&#x27;ve had far more luck with a hand made goats milk soap and straight argan oil as a moisturizer, and I have highly acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Literally, this is lotion they market as a cleanser. Lotion has no cleansing properties. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne since I was in high school and I am 25 now. I don&#x27;t know if I would even classify it as acne, but I always have clogged pores on my face and at least once a week a zit that usually causes me pain and leaves behind a light scar. I went to the dermi years ago and she prescribed me medication, but since I eventually got pregnant I discontinued its use and my acne came back. Since then I was breastfeeding my baby so I couldn&#x27;t return to the medication. After hearing such good reviews about Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser I gave it a try. Just so you know I have very irritable skin and large pores, any new products (from makeup, lotions, soap, to facial treatments) usually clog those pores and break me out but this one did not at all. Infact immediately, I mean like the next day after using it once, my skin felt smoother and clean. My oily skin felt regulated and not greasy at all. I DO NOT use this product to remove makeup, I use sensitive baby wipes to remove makeup, then follow up with this product to clean out my pores and clean off any makeup that I missed. It has been less then a week and already my husband and I are so impressed with how fresh and clear my face looks. I used to wake up with a fresh pimple everyday and haven&#x27;t since Cetaphil. And on the plus side my skin is so much softer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional tip when washing your face be sure to wash your hands with soap before you apply the cleanser to your skin or even touch your face. It guarantees any added dirt is not transferred from your hands to your face... a great tip that I got from the dermi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get this product at any store (grocery, Costco, walmart, pharmacy) and it is very cheap compared to prescription medication. Since it is not soap based it is very easy on irritable skin. This review is for the Cetaphil Gently Skin Cleanser and not the daily cleanser, I have not tried that product.</li>
            <li> This is about as far away from soap as it gets and that happens to be a VERY good thing. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather (I use it with a Clarisonic) and does exactly what it says - gently cleans the skin without stripping it. I never feel dried out or tight after using this on my face and my face still feels clean. It does a good job at taking makeup off too. No scents, no residues. Just a feeling left behind like your face is one hundred percent clean.</li>
            <li> Every other product has made my skin red, dry or both.  Never had any of these problems with this product.  Will always use it!!!</li>
            <li> In my early 20&#x27;s my face broke out horribly due to birth control. A dermatologist recommended this and it&#x27;s been the only thing that&#x27;s worked since. When trying to replace paraben containing products, I had a look at this label. There are so many parabens in it! I tried Whole Foods natural paraben free version of it, but it makes the skin around my mouth tingle which causes me some worry.  I switched back to this thinking that my face is a very small percentage of my skin &#x3D; the paraben absorbtion&#x27;s got to be pretty low as compared with a lotion for the whole body. It&#x27;s really the only thing that works with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I massage it on my skin and eyes, then take a wet &amp; hot wash cloth and remove it all. I&#x27;ve found that if I just tried to wash it off with water and my hands, the film left behind bothered me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had twin babies and just ran out of time or interest in makeup and so I really don&#x27;t need to wash my face very much anymore and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products I can use on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in place of hand soap on a daily basis and on my face every&lt;br /&gt;night before bed with no sign of the peeling and rashes I get with&lt;br /&gt;all soaps and most other soap-alternatives.  Cetaphil also makes&lt;br /&gt;a bar cleanser I intend to try.</li>
            <li> This works great for sensitive skin in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out. But you don&#x27;t get that super clean feeling like the regular because it doesn&#x27;t suds or lather.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the few reviews of people saying it broke them out with hives, I thought they were exaggerating,but it happened to me. This lotion is does not have any fragrance, which is nice, but it leaves the skin feeling superficially moisturized, wet like, just not a texture for the skin. For itchy dry skin, eczema, I found the best lotions are Aveno and CeraVe. I use Aquafor also for the most dry spots. Aquaphor and Cerave were recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> A skincare regime is paramount for maintaining a youthful and vibrant skin. A cleanser like this one included in your cleansing is clinically proven to be 4x less irritating. This is because it contains an important humectant: propylene glycol that aids in improved hydration. This mild skin cleanser is usually recommended by dermatologists to their patients with skin conditions, as it is non-comedogenic and has neutral pH formulations. It contains some essential skin-friendly ingredients and a mild, non-irritating formula that contributes to a totally non-alkaline and fragrance-free product. A cleanser that not only suits all skin types but also works well on sensitive skin, it calms and softens the facial skin while cleaning it. The greatest benefit of using this skin cleanser is that it aids in retaining moisture, making your skin look supple and young. A cleanser that can be used for your entire body, it also works well on the delicate skin of babies. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excessively dry skin and eczema runs in my family. During the wintertime, many of my family members suffer from red, cracked hands with eczema. I decided to purchase this item to see if it would help. We have been very pleased with this cleanser. My family has noticed that their hands are significantly less red and dry then they were when we used regular soap. It cleans your skin without drying it. I have placed this on subscribe and save so that we can receive a new supply each month. It has truly made a difference for our family. I now have a bottle right next to every sink for hand washing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have issues getting something that works well. I tried this out and my skin dried out fast. I use this only if my face is really gross and has make up on it to get a clean feel. I still have most of the bottle left. Will probably try an organic soap or continue using Dove sensitive skin soap bar when needed.</li>
            <li> My doc recommended it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing high end skin products (mostly Dermalogica and Yonka) but after searching for less expensive products to replace them, I discovered this line by Cetaphil. Highly recommend. The body moisturizer and body wash are also very good.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to sensitive and/or dry skin. It&#x27;s very gentle and after the wash the face feels so soft.  It also helped tremendously to reduce pimples (well this might due to the face is washed more often.) Anyway, it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin can be very difficult, especially in the winter. I have acne, but my face becomes very dry with the air, so I was looking for a facial cleanser that might help even out my erratic skin. Cetaphil is absolutely excellent and has been working great since I purchased it. My skin still feels elastic after I dry my face off, and I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the cleanser with Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer alongside my acne gel, and my face has been looking a lot smoother and clearer. This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. washes away easily. I would recomend this to just about anyone. Even my GF likes to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product for him and it&#x27;s very hard to find in local stores so I&amp;#34;ve ordered a couple of bottles for him.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I use to wash my hands--alcohol- or soap-based products cause instant dermatitis.</li>
            <li> My mom did a lab in microbiology where you took a bacteria swipe and different brands of facewash, put them in a petri dish and saw which ones actually killed bacteria.  Well, to my surprise Cetaphil came out on top.  It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much when I wash my face which I don&#x27;t really like, but in science I trust.  Kinda feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a really watery lotion on your face with the lack of lather.</li>
            <li> Having struggled with acne for long periods of my life, I finally feel like I&#x27;ve found the perfect product for me. On a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, I used to wash my face with products that include 10% benzoyl peroxide to deal with breakouts but that just left my skin irritated and dry. This cleanser is gentle enough for me to use twice a day and effective enough to control my acne.</li>
            <li> really nice feeling to my face and it feels natural. I have seen it at the doctors office many time but never thought about trying it. Always seen that it was picked over on the shelf at Walley world also. so now I have it and have been use it for sometime..... its not a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil was recommended to me by another young woman whose skin was perfection. Since starting using Cetaphil, my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has cleared up.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil cleanser cleans off the oil and dirt without drying out the skin. It can even be used without rinsing so I keep a tiny container with me on the go. It also removes non-waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, be worth buying, I like It, it made my face more smooth, clear, and beautify. and so on</li>
            <li> As a guy, skincare hasn&#x27;t been much of a priority and anything besides water was never required. But this winter was especially harsh and my skin was flaky and red for the first time in my life. After lots of research, I developed a routine that has improved my face and skin tremendously. I use this cleanser at night in conjunction with a witch hazel toner and Cetaphil moisturizer in the morning. Just a little bit of effort has improved my skin and turned me into a loyal fan of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> This was my number one facial cleanser as after using it my blemishes were not as persistent. I use another facial soap now but i still use this cetaphil for hand soap as it leaves my hands soft after a wash.</li>
            <li> you can use this to remove makeup, shower and wash your hands.  It&#x27;s very gentle and does not strip oils from your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was in 5th grade, I&#x27;m now going into my senior year of high school. I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of face washes from clean &amp; clear to proactive &amp; nothing has seemed to help. About 2 weeks ago, a family member introduced me to cetaphil &amp; I saw immediate results with my face. It is now almost fully clear &amp; I&#x27;ve had no breakouts &amp; it leaves my face feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I love cetaphil, and I have a excelent experienc buying in Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product, Made in the Good USA, and this product does work. I will always buy Cetaphil products, I bought their soap which is cheaper in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have suuuper sensitive skin and this has never given me a reaction. Works well on body, and even on face if you&#x27;re particularly dried out.  Was a lifesaver when I lived in the Colorado dry weather</li>
            <li> Best face wash! I never had acne as a teenager, and now coming into my 20&#x27;s all the sudden I&#x27;ve had nasty breakouts all the time. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days &amp; have already seen a major difference! NO new breakouts, old ones are clearing up and not red, and my skin is smooth. It&#x27;s gentle, but definitely does its job! You wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be so amazing by the bottle! Lol. I won&#x27;t be switching!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin. I also have ezcema and I&#x27;m a fairly dark skinned woman. I suffered from cystic type acne on my face 2 months ago out of nowhere. My doctor prescribed this as a method of acne help...IT DID NOTHING.....I followed using this with a mild simple brand toner and spot treatment....nothing.....I started using the avon clearskin brand I think in the gray bottle and m skin is doing so much better i could cry in about a couple of weeks time......</li>
            <li> For a very oily and acne-prone skin I have tried a lot of cleansers but I have always keep coming back on this one. At first you will doubt on the effectiveness on this product as its very simple. No enticing smell or packaging. Just simple and mild yet effective.</li>
            <li> As always Cetaphil works for me. Is a very good cleaner for all type of skins. Perfect to use in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> I had been using the oil cleansing method to wash my face, but it got too pricy and quite time consuming, so I switch back to my Cetaphil cleanser. I won&#x27;t say that it has cleared up the stubborn spot of acne I have above my brows yet, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any extra acne either! I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the very few products that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout or make me sick with the smell of it. I really like it a lot, it&#x27;s one of the very best cleansers out there. Just as a note: I have very sensitive, normal to oily skin, with mild patches of papules on my forehead and above/in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin.  Helps remove dirt from face without the harsh chemicals.  My Aesthetician recommended it and it has helped me with my face washing and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Nice product! It does the job of cleaning and refreshing my face, and it is not harmful to my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> This skin cleanser leaves yours hands clean and soft. It is non greasy and works very well! This is great especially during the winter months when skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash for years.  I constantly had at least one big pimple, sometimes two or three and always multiple small, healing pimples.  I always thought - well, that&#x27;s just my skin; I&#x27;m never going to be pimple-free.  Then I tried this cleanser.  After three months I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders; I just don&#x27;t have to worry about pimples like I used to.  I don&#x27;t have to spend an extra five minutes in the morning covering them up and then worrying about the makeup coming off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so impressed with my skin after starting this product - it&#x27;s softer, more luminous and fresh-looking.  I have actually been able to go out without makeup.  Seriously.  Maybe my skin is not blemish-free, but it&#x27;s so much better than it used to be that I feel confident now without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I still get the occasional pimple but it heals in 1-2 days where it used to take 3-4.  The pimple&#x27;s much smaller and less noticeable.  I also only have the one where I used to have multiple others at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I will caution two things:&lt;br /&gt;1) You may need to use a makeup remover in addition to the cleanser, especially for your eye makeup.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Eye Makeup Remover for my eye makeup only; I do not use a makeup remover on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;2) You&#x27;ll want to use this for a few weeks before making a determination.  After a few days my skin was softer but the pimples were about the same.  After two weeks, I had slightly fewer pimples and my skin tone was starting to even out.  Now three months later, my skin is truly looking luminous, more even-toned, and much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;The main reasons I chose this product are because it&#x27;s cheap, easy to find, and gentle.  I figured that between the anti-bacterial face wash and the acidic pimple cream, I&#x27;d abused my skin enough over the years and it had earned a break.  I am happy to say that my skin is handsomely repaying me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 9/22/2014**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this product for nine months and I am absolutely, 100% sold.

            <li> This is my favorite stuff for washing my face.  You could probably get it cheaper at the store if there is a good sale or some BOGO offer but those seem to be few and far between so I think this was a decent deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle and soft that i can&#x27;t feel it.I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s this cleanser for...But it&#x27;s definitely good for such price with such two huge cleansers.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It isn&#x27;t too harsh but it definitely makes my face feel clean and soft. Not to mention it has been helping a lot with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly and was exactly as described. This cleanser is very gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or tight feeling. I have used this product for many years and I have very few (if any) breakouts.  The container is particularly nice and easy to use, when I travel the lid is capable of locking and doesn&#x27;t leak. For the price the amount of product received is more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam, if you absolutely need the foam to feel clean this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I use this face cleaner for mornings early,  you don&#x27;t expat to clean your skin after all that makeup all day do you? It&#x27;s gentle and makes my ckin very confirmtable. Also, price is really good, better than those French drug store brands, love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have roseacea.  This is a great cleanser for any skin type but especially for those of us who have sensitive skin.  Buy it - you will be very pleased with your purchase!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very gentle on skin and does not dry the skin. I am not sure if these products have it but the only thing I did not like is that there was no manufacture date or expiry date on the product.</li>
            <li> does not neccessarily have to be rinsed off with water, non irritating, for very sensitive skin, use it sinceabout 8 years daily. after recommendation by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser is a fantastic gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  Though it may not be as natural as I&#x27;d prefer, this product is still great for those wanting to transition from harsher, fragranced face washes.  Unlike traditional soaps, it won&#x27;t strip your skin of vital oils.  Rarely have I borken out while using this product.  Just be sure to properly moisturize immediately after washing your face.  I highly recommend this Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser - it&#x27;s gentle, effective, and won&#x27;t strain your budget.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the first time I am super happy with an Amazon.com purchase. I spent about $16 for 2 of these and got $10 off by applying for the Amazon.com store card, which made the total purchase about $6. This product works better than I thought and does wonders for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper buying on Amazon.com than at a retail store. I would rather wait the 2-4 days to get in the mail rather than spend more money at a retail store. I am very frugal so I watch every dollar of my money. Anyway overall this product worked wonders for me and it helps with my dry hands and arms.</li>
            <li> This is just the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, period. I started using Cetaphil Gentle Skin around age 12, when I first began (properly) washing my face. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers but have always returned to my tried and true, trusty Cetaphil. There really isn&#x27;t anything superior to it  for my skin. The fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive is icing on the proverbial cake. This product is super gentle, as its name implies; non-foaming/soap-free (which is a huge plus in my book), and most importantly, it never irritates, aggravates or strips my combination, sensitive/reactive skin. I celebrated my 30th birthday this year, and everyone who meets me is shocked when I tell them and they find out I&#x27;m not 21 or 22 yrs old. I actually credit this cleanser with much of my youthful appearance, because it has been a staple in my skin care regimen for so many consecutive years now that I cannot imagine it hasn&#x27;t made a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t want to ever be without it. I use it morning and night, every day, to keep my skin looking and feeling immaculate. It does just that, and I have nothing bad to say about it. I plan on using it forever. Simply the best! (cue Ms. Turner...)</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is an amazing product. Our family has been using it for the longest time. It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse. You will not spend a lot of time just to remove that slippery feeling when using soaps. After you dry with a face towel, you will feel the difference on your skin. Oil is gone without you face feeling stretch dry.</li>
            <li> the product arrived in perfect condition and on time.&lt;br /&gt;we thought it was one but we got 2 units.&lt;br /&gt;which was paid for what we had not realized we had not that detail.&lt;br /&gt;but we did not care charm and the price was the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, very gentle. I like it a lot. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better than this in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for many years and I am not kidding when I say that I have tried EVERYTHING! This is by far the best skin cleanser out there. I use this every single day and cannot live without it. I always buy it in bulk. It&#x27;s the best hands down !</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old.  I had mild to moderate acne in my early 20&#x27;s - which was cleared up by using Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin ID system.  Well, Neutrogena discontinued SkinID recently and my skin regressed as soon as the products ran out.  I used what Neutrogena recommended - which didn&#x27;t help at all (it didn&#x27;t work when I used it before SkinID either- shock).  I bought Cetaphil on a whim... it started clearing up my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2x daily, and other than some minor drying (not overall, just drying out my acne) I have had nothing but impressive results.  My skin is healthier looking, no new breakouts, old acne has healed up.  There&#x27;s a reason Cetaphil is so well received.  It is a genuinely good product that provides consistent results.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a bit too gentle on my face but it is a good cleanser for people with dry or sensitive skin because it does not irritate nor dry out your skin. I have acne prone, oily skin and I needed a cleanser than would help me with my skin. I&#x27;ve heard my friends saying that their doctors recommend this to them for their acne however, it does not clean my face super well nor help with my acne. I would have to double cleanse at night (using another different cleanser along with Cetaphil) because I am just super oily by the end of the day. I use the Cetaphil cleanser just to remove the layers of residue from products I&#x27;ve used during the day and I use the second cleanser to actually help with my skin rather than just removing residue and oil. This is a good product to try since it is very affordable  and one bottle will last you a lot longer compared to other cleansers however, be aware that there are SLS and parabens in this product.</li>
            <li> The product is one of the best not aggressive skin cleanser I have ever used. I have a very sensible skin and I use Cetaphil every day to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;The price is verycompetitive and the packed arrived in good conditions and before the despatched date indcicated.</li>
            <li> gentle clean the face and leave skin clean and soft. my mom has sensitive skin and she loves it. Now she only chooses this product for face wash. I use it for morning cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love Cetaphil.  It does the job gently and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I love it for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Product arrived but had leaked all over the place!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this Cetaphil (cleanser) two years ago when they were on sale at BJ’s. Now I buy them through my husband’s prime account which is cheaper. My husband tried this and loved it, now he uses this after he shaves his face, because he loves how smooth it make his face. This product has actually become a staple for me (and now my husband) which is hard to believe, because I LOVE  trying new products.  First, I want to point out that Cetaphil makes two cleanser this one and another, which is for “ Normal to oily skin”. I have never tried the other cleanser so I will not be doing a comparison in that perspective. What I will do is better help you understand what you will and will not get form this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect: This product is very mild as it is for sensitive skin. You can use it with or without water. This product is very thin so I prefer using it without water, since using it with water (on a damp face) makes it feel like it is sliding off my face.  This  is  a soap-free cleanser so do not expect suds when lathering  with it. A little goes a long way for me a 16 oz bottle last three months; my routine is to use it morning and night. This specific product can be used on your body and on babies as well since it is non-comedogenic  (it does not clog your pores which is how pimples are formed) and fragrance free. Your face will feel very soft and hydrated after using it. If you are currently experiencing an acne break out this product will not aggravate your skin, it will gently clean the pores which will overtime get rid of the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What not to expect: This brand of Cetaphil will not fix acne breakout within a week, in fact it takes weeks from my experience, which is why I use another product when I have a break out.  This product will not do anything for acne scaring or discoloration on your skin from my experience. After using this product your skin will not feel tight or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) It cleans makeup brushes very well .&lt;br /&gt;2) For acne prone people (like myself) you may need another product specifically for acne. Since this brand is for sensitive skin you can follow up with Cetaphil before or after using  an acne specific product one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Thanks for reading and I hope this information was helpful to you **eup brushes very well .&lt;br /&gt;2) For acne prone people (like myself) you may need another product specifically for acne.

            <li> Just as expected wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea several years ago, which means that not only is my skin super sensitive, but any sort of microbead/exfoliating substance is likely to cause me to break out and look as if I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for too long. This cleanser is great because it lessens my redness (I wear glasses and the contrast between my undereye skin and the redness in my cheeks was extremely obvious before I started using this). I had struggled finding the right cleanser to use for awhile--I mostly strayed towards all-natural products, like from Lush, because I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d be better for my face. When they stopped working and starting making my face even worse, my dermatologist told me that all-natural products on sensitive skin can actually react negatively and cause the break-outs that I was experiencing. She gave me samples of Cetaphil to use, and I&#x27;ve been on it ever since. While I&#x27;m still hunting for an extra cleanser to deal with some of my nastier blackheads, this has cleared up 98% of my face (except for the aforementioned blackheads that enjoy lurking on my nose). I would definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and/or rosacea!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so gentle that you maybe be inclined to use more product that needed. I like it because it is not abrasive.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t harm your skin and you can use it without water! The Price is awesome, comparing to the Price in other places. You can use this as a daily cleanser for your face or to clean other areas in your body. In fact, you can even use it as a shaving gel (even better for sensitive skin than comercial shaving gel).. It&#x27;s also perfect in &amp;aacute;reas of contact dermatitis, when you can&#x27;t use soap, (because it soothes your skin) and even better for atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and many people said this cleanser is mild and non additive. I have finished one bottle. And i feel it is really mild and make my skin clean .</li>
            <li> This product is good!!! If you have super sensitive skin, buy this! It won&#x27;t dry your skin like crazy. If you have normal skin, buy the normal skin one. That one works good as that one, but the other one is more stronger. The only down side is, this product came damage to my house. But Amazon is good and will replace it with another one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friend. She likes this product because it&#x27;s good for those who have sensitive skin. She always trust this brand.</li>
            <li> I use it for years. It&#x27;s very good, even for my extremely sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. My skin becomes very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Use Cetaphil daily now.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser for sensitive skin at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have a poodle pomeranian. He gets facial hair in between grooming and his beard is stinky. I take a wash cloth with some cetaphil and wash his face. Its very effective.</li>
            <li> Like lots of acne sufferers, I have combination skin, which means I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. I have had acne since I was 12 years old. I&#x27;m 22 now and this lotion is the best thing I have ever used on my face, and I use it on the rest of my body, too. After a couple weeks of using this, my acne disappeared. I am totally amazed. I never liked lotion on my face for various reasons; some smelled weird, some made my skin feel greasy, some made me break out.... Some (like proactive) dried out my skin so bad that it cracked. None of those things are a problem with Cetaphil. It is lightweight but extremely moisturizing, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Its kind of expensive, but the bottle lasts forever, since you only need a small amount. Best time for me to put it on is after a shower. Would recommend highly to anyone with acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the ultimate for at-home sensitive skin care. Buying in bulk from amazon also saves bucks!</li>
            <li> Great product; always use this.  Daughter and Granddaughter too.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing that works on my skin... super fast shipping too</li>
            <li> My skin is horribly sensitive and for years I have been thinking it was also oily. The reality was that my skin was overproducing oil because it was allergic to everything. I was using purpose liquid soap for years which seemed to work but when I hit my 40&#x27;s my skin changed dramatically and everything was hurting. I went back to using cetaphil cleanser which I used when I was teenager due to over drying acne products. My skin doesn&#x27;t react and is never dry or oily. I love this cleanser!  Edited to add: please be aware that this cleanser does not totally remove all dirt and makeup from your skin. You must also use a toner afterwards to get everything off (or a makeup remover product prior).</li>
            <li> The product it self is good but I do not like how it was delivered. One of the pumps were open and some of the fluid leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil does clean the oil and does feel good.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and pregnancy has made it worse. A lot of products irritate my skin but I started putting on Cetaphil fresh out of the shower and it has improved the my skin&#x27;s texture, complexion, and restored moisture to it. It feels nice all the time. It hasn&#x27;t been this good in years. I wish I started using it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Awesome - great value</li>
            <li> very cheap compared with my country!!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, itchy skin...but can get a break out here and there in hotter months. Strangely, my sister-n-law, who had really bad acne, introduced me to this product. She found out about it from her dermatologist. It really works well for both of us. It is a little pricey, but not compared to prescription treatments.</li>
            <li> As promised, this cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have used it regularly for years and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I work in a restaurant and tried everything. After two weeks of using this my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li> I recommended to everybody to buy it . It is one the best skin cleanser I have ever had</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I was diagnosed with Vulval Dermatitis/Excema.  Any contact with soap or shampoo would cause severe itching followed by severe dryness, cracking sometimes to the point of bleeding.  Needless to say, I was desperate to find a soap or body wash (and shampoo) that doesn&#x27;t cause this horrible allergic reaction.  Nothing worked.  After months of agony I finally found an article that recommended contacting a chemist or pharmacist to find a 100% soap and fragrance free soap alternative.  My pharmacist said that dermatologists recommend Cetaphil or Ceravae.  I called a local dermatologist who echoed the pharmacists words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just happened to have a big pump bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleaner that was given to me by my mother who passes things on to me when they were free and she doesn&#x27;t want them.  Lucky me!  I washed my hair over the tub to ensure no contact with shampoo.  Then I showered and washed with the Cetaphil.  I was disappointed that there were absolutely NO suds.  But after using it just once, and for the first time in almost a year, I am not suffering!  There was absolutely NO allergic reaction after contact.  I will never have to try another soap or cleanser again.  I am SO happy with this product!  I highly recommend it to anyone with Dermatitis/Excema or other problem skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cleanser that doesn&#x27;t smell nor leaves residue behind and yet leaves skin clean and not feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Cetaphil, it was da only product dat kould klear my face, I used it wen I was n da 5th grade but I ran out, so naturally I had 2 order it again!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I&#x27;ve struggled to develop a skincare routine and tried countless products- most of which were far more expensive. My dermatologist recommended this cleanser, and it&#x27;s simple and so effective. My skin feels cleaner and softer after every use, and I have chronically dry skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products- this is the best.</li>
            <li> En bra cleanser for alle hudtyper!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend who has similar skin however mines is way more sensitive. I was looking for a cleanser that will clean my skin without causing it to dry out but it seems this dried my skin out more than I could have possibly thought. The third time I cleaned my skin with this I immediately put on moisturizer because the first two times is dried out to the point it created dry scabs on my face but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m sure it is a decent product, just not that great for my skin and definitely not what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well and can even be used without water if necessary.  However, I do rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Gentle for sensitive skin. Ingredients are not on my good list. I will use it till I find something better.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle skin cleanser for those who have little to no acne. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, but I&#x27;m sure they just recommend this to everyone regardless of their level of acne. I had mild acne and this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s always done a great job of keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> 真的不错，下次还会考虑购买在，谢谢了！&lt;br /&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and love the gentleness of it. Have tried many of the multiple facial cleansers and this does a great job and was a great price!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and needed a gentle cleanser, this fits the bill.  It also has mostly healthy ingredients which has become very important to me recently.</li>
            <li> Very good skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I use it everyday and recommended to my relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my dermatologist when I started an Accutane treatment seven years ago and have been using it ever since. It is perfect for people with sensitive skin, like mine. It doesn&#x27;t leave the tight feeling I used to get from other facial cleansers, but instead leaves my skin soft. I use foundation everyday to cover up my rosacea and this always does the job in washing all traces of makeup off. Highly recommended! Also, Amazon has the cheapest price on it since it can be quite expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not pretty or fruity smelling, but it works. It&#x27;s gentle on skin (hence the name) but strong enough to get it clean. The price isn&#x27;t bad and if you&#x27;re even reading this, you&#x27;re looking for something that might work for you. So, just try it. I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it. I know my skin has never looked/felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re in the market for a moisturizer, as well, I suggest Neutrogena&#x27;s Stress Control Acne Treatment. These two together have worked wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013ER62M Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment 2oz]]</li>
            <li> I was use to the hard abrasive cleansers that really scrubbed your skin and left your face red after you washed it. I was under the impression that that was how cleansers should work. It also made me feel cleaner, but after a while I saw my skin starting to sag in some areas especially my neck and I&#x27;m only 35 years old. Now that I have started to use the Cetaphil my skin is tightening up and looks much healthier. I love this product. My dermatologist uses it in his office and I have gotten my mother using it now too. I also gave a bottle to a friend who was excited to start using it as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to admit it, but I used to use plain soap to clean my face every night. This dried out my face pretty badly, where even expensive moisturizers didn&#x27;t help. Then I read in a magazine about Cetaphil and bought a bottle on my next trip to Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I noticed an immediate difference! Now my skin is back to normal - I can&#x27;t believe I went this long with regular soap. The bottle also lasts a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear Mac foundation (sheer to medium) and I am noticing that it clogs my pores more than other brands of make-up. Every once in a while I break-out (more often than normal), so today I ordered a microdermabrasion brush that I am going to try using along with Cetaphil on the days I wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend everyone try this product because it&#x27;s gentle, works well, and it easy to use (even easier than regular soap).</li>
            <li> the most fast shipping :D&lt;br /&gt;once the product arrive i use it .. fresh feeling&lt;br /&gt;i give 4 stars just for 1 reason the pump was not close properly so some of the product go out&lt;br /&gt;but its dosent matter it was not much :P  ..&lt;br /&gt;thanks seller ..an slo thnx amazon</li>
            <li> Works great for babies with eczema and cradle cap- it&#x27;s really gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin any further than it already is for those babies who need to have their heads washed daily to remove the oily buildup of cradle cap.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product. I am immensely thankful; I&#x27;d bow down to this bottle of lotion if it wasn&#x27;t weird. SO FAR, my skin has improved drastically. It felt like everyday, new acne appeared on my face. Not to sound like an advertisement or anything, but it made my skin smoother, softer, moisturized (since it was dry because of winter), and the majority of my acne is gone in just a couple of days. The only thing I have left is acne marks for the areas I messed with before, but they&#x27;re clearing up as well. The only possible con would be the ingredients: it includes parabens, but a lot of products use it as a preservative and it&#x27;s a slight amount compared to the amount needed to actually pose harm. Again: thank you Cetaphil creators</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product again.  I have always had sensitive skin but since I&#x27;ve gotten older (pushing 50) it&#x27;s gotten even more sensitive including Rosacea.  When I use this it hydrates my skin without having any burning sensation.  It is so gentle.  I remember my dad using it years ago so this product has been around a long time and it&#x27;s also recommended by dermatologists.  I was so pleased with this that I started using their whole line.  I buy the bar soap for when I shower, their facial moisterizer and their cream for extrememly dry skin.  You will love these products.  A little pricey but, not too bad and why not treat yourself and your skin?</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and this cleanser is gentle but also effective enough to leave my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a skin cleanser for my husband.  It was recommended by his dermatologist. My husband was given a sample of Cetaphil skin cleanser in the office.  it was great for the shower and foamed like soap.  The product that was sent to me in this order works like water.  Neither of us  will use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, but since I got pregnant, it&#x27;s been even worse. All my face cleansers were burning my face whenever I used them. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my face red when I use it. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was becoming a big problem.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed chronic dry skin. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive face wash and lotion and exfoliating products and everything I&#x27;ve tried has made me break out, or didn&#x27;t really help. Until now. Two days ago the skin on my face was so dry and flaky I couldn&#x27;t use makeup and was embarrassed to have people get too close to my face. Two days of washing my face with this and following up with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry/Sensitive Skin and my 34 yr old skin now looks almost as good as it did when I was 24. It doesn&#x27;t just look better, it feels better, smoother, no break outs, and even heavy foundation goes on flawlessly. And in only 2 days of use! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m finally getting such amazing results, and at such a low price! I had planned on waiting a few weeks to give long term results but the incredible difference after only two days made me decide not to wait. If you have dry, flaky skin that&#x27;s sensitive to everything else, try this right now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand how some reviewers claim this does not remove make-up; I use foundation, concealer, eye liner and shadow and even use a setting spray to keep it all in place. And the Cetaphil removes all of it easily! Just massage onto DRY skin, then wipe off with washcloth and its all gone, plus my skin is soft and not irritated, never dry. Another great thing I do with this cleanser is to add a teaspoon of baking soda and use it as an exfoliator, makes my skin smooth like nothing else. This is a great product for my dry and sensitive skin and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that your product has no expiration date printed in the product itself. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s already expired or what. I think printing the ED is a standard procedure.</li>
            <li> Gentle, fragrance free, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Nice to use as a cleanser for surgery patients who can&#x27;t get to a shower since you don&#x27;t have to have water to rinse off.  You never know when you wont be able to use water, as I discovered when our water heater went out last week and the water had to be shut off to repair.  Leaves skin soft and there is no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, This is not good for my skin.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts in a while....Until I started using this.  I now have 2 huge zits on my chin and my face never feels clean after I use this.  I will go back to using my old face wash.  I wanted to like it as I have heard so many good things about it.  Before this, I was using the olay foaming face wash for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 60 but started using this product in my early 30&#x27;s on the advice of a dermatologist I was working for. My skin is very dry and occasionally prone to break-outs, particularly if not cleansed thoroughly. In my younger days, i just slathered it on and wiped face clean with tissues. I&#x27;ve also used Cover Girl Lush Lash Mascara (never runs or causes raccoon eyes) for over 30 years. This Cetaphil cleans it off easily because it&#x27;s a gel-based mascara. This Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t work as well on waterproof mascaras. After menopause, I got pimples more than I ever had them as a teen. It was like being in menopause and adolescence at the same time. My skin became very sensitive to any new makeup, and I love makeup. Now, I wet my face, slather on Cetaphil, wash with my finger tips, and rinse. Then I repeat the whole process with a washcloth to get off every trace of makeup, rinse again, and follow with Cetaphil Cream at night and Lotion for day (although now I need special sunscreen from dermatologist as well). Works for me! Great price (2 cost about $10 less than drugstore). Fast, fast shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li> So like any of you, whenever I change a product it takes me a few months to acclimate with my skin I believe, I also believe the change in seasons has an effect on your skin. (i.e. this winter I had re-occuring acne around my mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser has done what it is supposed to do for me, it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like my last cleanser did (Neutrogena Deep Clean), though I still have to moisturize my entire face after using this, some spots apply a lot I feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall is that I don&#x27;t think it really cleans that great, but you have to sacrifice something in order not to dry the skin out that much, if I use it twice a day, after before work in the morning and after work in early evening(5-6pm), my face generally stays somewhat clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really not sure what type of skin I have but I know it is sensitive, my pores are very visible, not that smooth skin like most females have. Also, it is generally dry after a shower, but a few hours and it becomes a bit more oily. Would anyone seriously do a video review?</li>
            <li> My favorite skin cleanser.  Did you know you can use this with or without water???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on your face then simply wipe it off with a clean towel.  I&#x27;ve tried this and it works!  That makes it perfect for places where you might not want to splash water (in a public bathroom maybe) on your face but would like to refresh your skin and then reapply your make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that it&#x27;s effective against acne.  I use it with my clarisonic for exfoliation and works great for me!</li>
            <li> This product is a truly gentile product.  It cleanses without leaving the face feeling parched and itchy.  An old favorite.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our pediatrician for my kiddo&#x27;s eczema.  It works.  While we tried several other cleansers, this was the only one that really worked.  Three years later I still use it to wash my preschooler, and her eczema is now under control 98% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your child has serious baby eczema, this is the best stuff on the planet for dealing with that.  Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for cleaning, Aquaphor for the flare ups, Eucerin Cream for the maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use cheaper generics, but that didn&#x27;t work out for me.  Maybe my kid has designer name-brand skin or something.  This was well worth the price for the name brand product for us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 20 yrs. recommended by my dermatologist. You don&#x27;t wash it off, just tissue it off, after removing my eye makeup ( I use eye makeup removal pads ) . Price is right, don&#x27;t need water, it works.</li>
