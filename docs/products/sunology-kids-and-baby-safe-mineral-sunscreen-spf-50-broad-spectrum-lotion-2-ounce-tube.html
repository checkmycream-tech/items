            <li>It was silky smooth and extremely easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I like the way that it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is not scented, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>Never once did anyone get burned, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>So far it has been great on sensitive skin not drying or leaving a rash.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and works really well.</li>
            <li>Pretty thick but works great!</li>
            <li>and it works better than NON natural brands full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I have used and living in Florida near the beach, we use A LOT of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It seemed to get better reviews than the adult version.  </li>
            <li>Spreads on pretty nicely, Just wish it was a little more affordable.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty easy and if rubbed in will pretty much disappear.</li>
            <li>Love that is save and free of all the fake stuff, I even used it on my dad and he loved it</li>
            <li>but it was easy enough to clean off with some soapy water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am always searching for the best products to protect my child&#x27;s skin, and this is definitely a winner!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not oily and heavy or smelly like other products, it has great spf protection against the sun for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is pretty darn good if you want a less toxic option.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I really like the packaging.  </li>
            <li>This has a moisturizer in it that really seems to work.</li>
            <li>This did not prevent me from getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li>It goes on thick and leaves a fair skinned person looking like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>The tube is smaller than I expected, and smaller than most sunscreens you could buy at a drugstore for this price, but I feel better knowing I&#x27;m putting something &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; on my infant son.</li>
            <li>I tried many other products and this one wins out for me and my entire family.</li>
            <li>I was previously using Think Sport and I like this better.</li>
            <li>This new formula is smooth as silk and such a pleasure to use on my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has worked well at high elevations.</li>
            <li>This item is also priced fairly high for its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better than the 3 or 4 other biodegradable sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this sunscreen because it is a natural sunscreen that is also water resistant.</li>
            <li>It was so sticky and left a bizarre bluish white layer on my skin</li>
            <li>I like that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>So far, not greasy or clumpy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, by the way, I&#x27;m an adult using the kids version of the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because I was looking for something specifically targeted to protect my 1yr old from harmful uv rays of the Las Vegas desert.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for kiddos with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have several spots of skin cancer, so it&#x27;s beyond important that I keep covered up and use sunblock, especially while undergoing treatment, and this stuff is just terrific.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my two young children during our spring break trip.</li>
            <li>This one rubs in better than the yellow and green ones, but still leaves a white hue!</li>
            <li>It leaves a barely noticeable white layer of cream.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me despite numerous applications, doesn&#x27;t absorb well (to be expected from zinc oxide), and is priced high.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I could see where it was applied (a bonus on children) but it quickly absorbed and did not leave behind a white residue.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave it on long.</li>
            <li> The Think Sport seemed to dry out my skin and didn&#x27;t blend in all that well.</li>
            <li> Works well for our son who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Went on white (as they all do), but after rubbing in for a few minutes, whiteness went away.  </li>
            <li> When applying remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will be checking out their other products.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is thicker so it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the pores like other products, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel tacky like other sunblocks and provides hours of protection while in water.</li>
            <li> I tried to be careful in the application but still did not adequate provide protection.</li>
            <li> It is tough to rub in - and leaves a grey cast on your face and sticks in your hair (my hubby has a beard), but hey it kept me from burning!  </li>
            <li> Moral of the story is I probably will throw the remaining amount away if that gives you any idea on how well it works vs how expensive it</li>
            <li> We would apply it in the morning before going out - and honestly never reapplied.  </li>
            <li> was a negative for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always opposed to using chemical sunscreens on their delicate skin</li>
            <li> And to make things worse, my son got burned so badly that we had to end our vacation early.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth that one annoyance to know I&#x27;m not putting horrible chemicals into my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen.  I just got back from a Caribean Cruise and my husband and I plus 2 kids used this sunscreen.  I always burn.  But this stuff protected me!  We would apply it in the morning before going out - and honestly never reapplied.  It says water resistent up to 80 minutes - but it lasted ALL day for me.  It is tough to rub in - and leaves a grey cast on your face and sticks in your hair (my hubby has a beard), but hey it kept me from burning!  It did leave marks on my bathing suit as well - but again 5 stars for me.  I will be checking out their other products.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I don&#x27;t like putting chemical laden things on my children, so I like that this is all natural. It is not greasy or oily. It goes on easily, and works really well. It didn&#x27;t burn their eyes or irritate their skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a discount**</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this sunscreen because it is a natural sunscreen that is also water resistant. My kids have used this for 2 days and both got a sunburn. It feels greasy when it goes on and it leaves them with a bluish white shine.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is pretty darn good if you want a less toxic option. It goes on pretty easy and if rubbed in will pretty much disappear. I was previously using Think Sport and I like this better. The Think Sport seemed to dry out my skin and didn&#x27;t blend in all that well. This has a moisturizer in it that really seems to work. When applying remember, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need a mound of this on your palm. You&#x27;ll just never rub it in.</li>
            <li> I like this sunblock, it is easy to spread on the face, nice for children.</li>
            <li> Has worked well at high elevations. It leaves a barely noticeable white layer of cream. I recommend this as an alternative to sunblocks containing toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this mineral sunblock. I have found out of the many I have tried it goes on the smoothest. It does rub on car seats, etc. as I haven&#x27;t found a mineral sunblock that doesn&#x27;t... but it&#x27;s worth that one annoyance to know I&#x27;m not putting horrible chemicals into my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty thick but works great!</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen that my son has not had a reaction to.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for an honest review, all opinions are honest and not influenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always searching for the best products to protect my child&#x27;s skin, and this is definitely a winner!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not oily and heavy or smelly like other products, it has great spf protection against the sun for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It works great and protects skin from sunburn awesomely.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It works better than anything else I have used and living in Florida near the beach, we use A LOT of sunscreen. I have two boys and they are constantly in the water both the pool and the ocean. This product stays on for hours and nothing gets through. Also, a little goes a long way! I am just now finishing my 1st bottle after 8 weeks of summer! Thank you for making such a great product that I feel safe putting on my boys.</li>
            <li> Summary: It didn&#x27;t work for me despite numerous applications, doesn&#x27;t absorb well (to be expected from zinc oxide), and is priced high. Moral of the story is I probably will throw the remaining amount away if that gives you any idea on how well it works vs how expensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It has mineral based ingredients and is rated well on EWG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I was the only one who used this sunscreen and the only one who got sunburned. It leaves a white residue which I don&#x27;t mind if it works, but the fact it didn&#x27;t work and I looked like a ghost was a negative for me. This item is also priced fairly high for its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m still on the search for a sunscreen that isn&#x27;t harmful to my body, but one that also serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Spreads easily and protects well. Good product.</li>
            <li> As sun protection it works, I think. It was so sticky and left a bizarre bluish white layer on my skin I didn&#x27;t leave it on long. I didn&#x27;t look close at the ingredients so I don&#x27;t know there is zinc oxide in this product but it felt/looked like that is what I was smearing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Better than the 3 or 4 other biodegradable sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Went on white (as they all do), but after rubbing in for a few minutes, whiteness went away.  Consistency is great.  So far, not greasy or clumpy.  Will stick with this one from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, I&#x27;m an adult using the kids version of the sunscreen.  It seemed to get better reviews than the adult version.  I don&#x27;t understand anyway why there&#x27;s ever a distinction.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well for our son who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> This one rubs in better than the yellow and green ones, but still leaves a white hue!</li>
            <li> Love that is save and free of all the fake stuff, I even used it on my dad and he loved it :) Im buying this again</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because I was looking for something specifically targeted to protect my 1yr old from harmful uv rays of the Las Vegas desert.  At first glance, I really like the packaging.  It&#x27;s perfect purse size for the wife to carry with her and apply as necessary.  It has a great smell to it.  I like the way that it goes on smoothly.  Sometimes I notice that sunblock will take forever to go on, but this one is nice.  Perfect consistency.  Really glad we found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and put it on my daughter to play out in the yard. It is not scented, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. The weather was sunny and 80 degrees. We played in the yard for a two hours without reapplying and my daughter did not get sun burned. I am going to test it in water later this week and I will review it further. So far it has been great on sensitive skin not drying or leaving a rash. I would recommend this product for kiddos with sensitive skin. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, total protection.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen without Oxybenzone... found it! The tube is smaller than I expected, and smaller than most sunscreens you could buy at a drugstore for this price, but I feel better knowing I&#x27;m putting something &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; on my infant son. This did take a while to soak in, so rubbed off a bit on his stroller and our floor... but it was easy enough to clean off with some soapy water.</li>
            <li> This new formula is smooth as silk and such a pleasure to use on my sensitive skin!  I have several spots of skin cancer, so it&#x27;s beyond important that I keep covered up and use sunblock, especially while undergoing treatment, and this stuff is just terrific.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for 3 years and it is a great sunblock. My dermatologist recommended it because it is safe and free of chemicals. It is thicker so it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the pores like other products, so use sparingly. A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t feel tacky like other sunblocks and provides hours of protection while in water. I tried many other products and this one wins out for me and my entire family. Give it a try--you will feel confident in the protection that it provides. Fabulous sunblock for adults and kids!</li>
            <li> Spreads on pretty nicely, Just wish it was a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> love the feel of it and it works better than NON natural brands full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This did not prevent me from getting too much sun.  I tried to be careful in the application but still did not adequate provide protection.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen!  I tried it on my two young children during our spring break trip. I&#x27;m always opposed to using chemical sunscreens on their delicate skin but I find that zinc sunscreens often don&#x27;t absorb well.  This was quite the opposite!  It was silky smooth and extremely easy to apply.  I could see where it was applied (a bonus on children) but it quickly absorbed and did not leave behind a white residue.  More importantly, it protected my kids for hours while in and out of the pool.  I will only use Sunology products on my family and for personal use going forward!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Never once did anyone get burned, goes on smooth. Love it</li>
            <li> I would give it zero stars if I could.  It goes on thick and leaves a fair skinned person looking like a ghost.  And to make things worse, my son got burned so badly that we had to end our vacation early.  He&#x27;s the only one who used this brand.</li>
