            <li>I love this brush, works wonders on my beard.</li>
            <li>I am glad I glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen these brushes in beauty stores before at a better price</li>
            <li>However, it sure brushes your hair well when you take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Evenly brushes hair! :)</li>
            <li>Great brush good for people just starting off getting waves</li>
            <li>Nicely made brush for a good price but the bristles are too soft for me.</li>
            <li>Compares easily to the so-called premium brands.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a fine tooth comb</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>this is my first beard brush, and overall I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>Perfect little brush for ironing out my mane.</li>
            <li>The palm handle is sturdy and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>No wonder this brush is so cheap.</li>
            <li>This brush is great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush to use for my short-hair beard, but I ended up using it brush my hair instead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in beard itch since using it.</li>
            <li>When I had my beard, this was the best brush for my beard which was 3/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>It is good for cleaning wooden floor and shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>The overall construction of the brush is good.</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush, but there are things that could be better.</li>
            <li>Many Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering the low price and good quality</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $6 for this brush, it&#x27;s not that high of quality.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush, with nice stiff natural bristles.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 for different bearded gents in my life, works fantastically as a beard brush but for a fraction of the price that most brushes labeled that way sell for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and quality is also, too many loose bristles, ok for occasional use I would not recommend, but a better brush</li>
            <li>Works great on my beard, I use it to groom my facial hair, the bristles are not excessively stiff.</li>
            <li>you want to be more like a piece of lifeless plastic, or a wild, tusked, man-crushing boar?</li>
            <li>Makes short work of keeping my beard neat and fits nicely in the kit bag.</li>
            <li>Must use to fully appreciate and get the feel for a soft, comfortable beard!  </li>
            <li>Some bristles have fallen out but overall a nice addition to my fiancé&#x27;s beard care.</li>
            <li>and this gets right after it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this Diane brush I bought through Amazon are excellent however the appearance of the wooden handle is a little tacky</li>
            <li>It feels great on the scalp - not too rough, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>but you will become hard, aggressive, and attractive to females.</li>
            <li>First boar brush and I must say that I like it.  </li>
            <li>It handles some rough use quite well, and directs the flow of follicles quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a brush like this at different stores, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better boar bristle brush, especially at this price!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, I use it for my beard.</li>
            <li>I thought that a large number of the bristles didn&#x27;t look right, so i cut some off and burned them.</li>
            <li>They show no ill effects from doing this.  </li>
            <li>and he uses this one more than his regular one.</li>
            <li>I get static cling from this brush if using it on my hair when dry.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Works really well for me</li>
            <li>but it still works very well.</li>
            <li>Do not think it was real Boar Brush</li>
            <li>&#x27;s what I ended up with and am very satisifed:  </li>
            <li>so much I bought another for the gym.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps over time it will become a bit more worn in, but my first impression was that the bristles were stiff, and some seems to fall off and stay in my beard or wax.  </li>
            <li>A little bit more firm/hard than I would have thought for pure boar hair...</li>
            <li>and I finally grew out my beard like a full on mountain man.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm without being coarse, and feel good in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is rough in some spots while smooth in others.</li>
            <li>Had a little trouble with shedding extra fibers for the first couple days, but it is great now.</li>
            <li>VERY soft bristles.</li>
            <li>it is very soft.</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping, Not as useful as I thought it would be as it is a little rough when hits the skin, not recommended for short newer beards, also the bristles seems to fall off easily and end up on my clothes and in my beard.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, easy to hold, using it on two Greyhounds, little hair and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough so it feels great against your skin but firm enough to take on fiercest facial hair.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll pay a little bit more for the soft brushes by Crown.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my beard, mainly to smooth and spread &amp;#34;Honest Amish - Heavy Duty Beard Balm&amp;#34; evenly across my beard.</li>
            <li>I might buy another to take with me throughout the day because my beard grows restless and gnarly without the frequent attention of</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to be using a brush with &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; written on the back.</li>
            <li>was looking for a soft brush to help maintain my hair when I keep it shorter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;so far.  </li>
            <li>My 20 year old brushes are 10 times stronger.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help keep my beard groomed and soft.  </li>
            <li>yet I work in a professional environment and don&#x27;t want to look like a mountain man or Unabomber.  </li>
            <li>Diane needs to go back to making the OLDER versions of ALL of their hair brush models.</li>
            <li>and it really wasn&#x27;t firm enough to adequately reach my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to maintain--I just use standard shampoo to wash them when they begin to get a little oily and collect dust.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush for my beard, it&#x27;s not real stiff</li>
            <li>I survived a couple months without a brush but keeping it tame was growing more and more difficult.</li>
            <li>I expected some shedding of bristles, but i had 6 entire plugs of bristles fall out on the first use.  </li>
            <li>May be better use for long or thick facial hair?</li>
            <li>my husband did not the fact that the brush is very soft, he prefers a harder bristle.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty basic, it has stiff bristles that aren&#x27;t too rigid and</li>
            <li>After smoothing out my beard, I runs the brush through my hair (from the temple to the back) and it transfers a little bit of balm there and really gives a finished look.</li>

            <li> My 20 year old brushes are 10 times stronger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help keep my beard groomed and soft.  </li>
            <li> yet I work in a professional environment and don&#x27;t want to look like a mountain man or Unabomber.  </li>
            <li> Diane needs to go back to making the OLDER versions of ALL of their hair brush models.</li>
            <li> and it really wasn&#x27;t firm enough to adequately reach my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to maintain--I just use standard shampoo to wash them when they begin to get a little oily and collect dust.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush for my beard, it&#x27;s not real stiff</li>
            <li> I survived a couple months without a brush but keeping it tame was growing more and more difficult.</li>
            <li> I expected some shedding of bristles, but i had 6 entire plugs of bristles fall out on the first use.  </li>
            <li> May be better use for long or thick facial hair?</li>
            <li> my husband did not the fact that the brush is very soft, he prefers a harder bristle.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty basic, it has stiff bristles that aren&#x27;t too rigid and</li>
            <li> After smoothing out my beard, I runs the brush through my hair (from the temple to the back) and it transfers a little bit of balm there and really gives a finished look.</li>
            <li> not waste your money on this, not worth your beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> It is a little too soft but still a well made brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit too soft in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband who had used his brush so long the bristles were falling out..</li>
            <li> with the minor defects I would still recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> (goodbye to my once long, flowing mane) and these brushes seem made for shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are all the same length (maybe one or two were missed by the machine to shave them down to the same length).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid brush, A few bristles will fall out in the beginning,but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall quality at all.</li>
            <li> Usually I experience a lot of irritation around my beard because of soft bristle brushes, but after I started using this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit long, but that&#x27;s not much to complain about.</li>
            <li> to soft to get between my beard hairs, just flattens it down, if you need a stiff brush look elsewhere</li>
            <li> when I opened the package the bristles started falling out in my hand, brush now has empty holes, and all I did was remove it from packaging...</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and delivered ahead of the forecast delivery date.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a thick course beard and he says this brush helps keep it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> rating is only on the performance of the brush, not including that it had a crack along the side upon receiving or any other physical defects along the hard surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are all stiff enough to comb through my hair, but if you are too rough with brushing your hair you might just scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts half as long, in which case I&#x27;ll be 103</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with these brushes shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li> I like how they glide through my hair, unlike other plastic bristle brushes that can pull.  </li>

            <li> but I was ordering a few other things and decided to just include it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, and don&#x27;t damage your beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot gentler than a small hairbrush I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> Not strong as I thought.</li>
            <li> De​finitely helps to tame my beast of a beard</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to keep it neater than your typical grizzly which is difficult because my hair is curly when grown out.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  </li>

            <li> Works good for a beard brush</li>
            <li> First boar brush and I must say that I like it.  It does a great job and brushing through my beard.  It had a few loose bristles, but those have seemed to work their way out.  Great brush to add to a dopp kit!</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, then buy a boar bristle brush. If you don&#x27;t have a beard, grow one. If you can&#x27;t grow a beard because you are a women, marry a man with a beard and buy him a boar bristle brush. If you can&#x27;t grow a beard because you are a boy, grow into a man, grow a beard, and buy a boar bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you brush your face daily with the plucked bristles of an awesome boar, the energy of a boar soaks into your face. When you use a regular girly plastic brush, you face becomes girly and plastic. Your beard withers. Stroke you face with this and you will not grow tusks but you will become hard, aggressive, and attractive to females. They will want to buy you another boar bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to be more like a piece of lifeless plastic, or a wild, tusked, man-crushing boar? Think about it.</li>
            <li> I got an awesome boars hair brush from sally beauty supply for $3.00</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping, Not as useful as I thought it would be as it is a little rough when hits the skin, not recommended for short newer beards, also the bristles seems to fall off easily and end up on my clothes and in my beard. May be better use for long or thick facial hair?</li>
            <li> Stocking Stuffer for my husband he loves it!</li>
            <li> Nicely made brush for a good price but the bristles are too soft for me.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned. Sheds like Persian cat.  VERY soft bristles. Might be good for shining shoes or something but worthless for grooming a thick beard.</li>
            <li> great brush, works very well. holding up perfect</li>
            <li> it is very soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> my husband did not the fact that the brush is very soft, he prefers a harder bristle.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush!</li>
            <li> Works well but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Perfect little brush for ironing out my mane. It handles some rough use quite well, and directs the flow of follicles quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Great I have purchased 4.</li>
            <li> It is a little too soft but still a well made brush.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. I have short African hair, and I use it for my faded cuts, and beard. It&#x27;s a bit long, but that&#x27;s not much to complain about. I have been looking for a brush like this at different stores, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any. So, this is a good fine for me. It&#x27;s a solid brush, A few bristles will fall out in the beginning,but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall quality at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better boar bristle brush, especially at this price! Compares easily to the so-called premium brands. Very well designed, fits in my hand perfectly. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, I use it for my beard.</li>
            <li> I use it for my short beard. Works really well for me</li>
            <li> I miss my beard. When I had my beard, this was the best brush for my beard which was 3/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thinning hair</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush to use for my short-hair beard, but I ended up using it brush my hair instead.  I think it works great!  It feels great on the scalp - not too rough, not too soft.  It can be a bit rough-feeling if you use it on your beard, but after repeated uses, your face skin will get used to it.  Construction quality is quite good.  The brush base is made of wood, and I have had no problem with any loose bristles.  I am very satisfied with this brush and would recommend it whether you need it for your beard or hair!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard, mainly to smooth and spread &amp;#34;Honest Amish - Heavy Duty Beard Balm&amp;#34; evenly across my beard. I had been using a fine tooth comb but this brush is 100 times better. After smoothing out my beard, I runs the brush through my hair (from the temple to the back) and it transfers a little bit of balm there and really gives a finished look.</li>
            <li> Product is great, work as mentioned.</li>
            <li> It is good for cleaning wooden floor and shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on this, not worth your beard.&lt;br /&gt;The brush hair started falling off the moment I opened the box.</li>
            <li> My beard is happy with it and you don&#x27;t argue with the beard</li>
            <li> I love this brush, works wonders on my beard.</li>
            <li> when I opened the package the bristles started falling out in my hand, brush now has empty holes, and all I did was remove it from packaging...</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband who had used his brush so long the bristles were falling out.. I asked him what rating he wanted to give it and he shrugged and said,&amp;#34;Give it a three&amp;#34;.  I asked, &amp;#34;Wasn&#x27;t it any good?&amp;#34; And he shrugged again and said, &amp;#34;Oh, it was average.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know what it would take for a brush to get a 4 or 5 rating....and neither does he!&lt;br /&gt;Mary Symons</li>
            <li> I have had a beard or some semblance of facial hair since college. I&#x27;m in my thirties now and I finally grew out my beard like a full on mountain man. I&#x27;ve tried to keep it neater than your typical grizzly which is difficult because my hair is curly when grown out. I survived a couple months without a brush but keeping it tame was growing more and more difficult. The brush saved my sanity and my beard. I would have trimmed it short without this brush. The boar bristles are perfect and it always puts every hair in its place. I might buy another to take with me throughout the day because my beard grows restless and gnarly without the frequent attention of it&#x27;s new best friend!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my husband and he told me it was one of the best gift a gave him...so my guess is he loves it....</li>
            <li> The overall construction of the brush is good. The palm handle is sturdy and comfortable in the hand. The bristles are firm without being coarse, and feel good in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the brush looses bristles regularly, and the rate of loss only increases with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad brush, and for the price it is still a deal. However, if you are looking or a brush that will last you for years to come, then you might want to start searching elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have hard hair to keep down and this gets right after it.  I am glad I glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but man does it smell. I thought  I got a horse brush by accident. But because I need it and don&#x27;t want to return it, I will give it a chance. Hopefully the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Great brush for course beards</li>
            <li> Gift for my friend.. does the job</li>
            <li> to soft to get between my beard hairs, just flattens it down, if you need a stiff brush look elsewhere</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty basic, it has stiff bristles that aren&#x27;t too rigid and a wooden handle that&#x27;s easy to hold.  I am currently using it for my beard and it&#x27;s working well.  I&#x27;ve seen these brushes in beauty stores before at a better price but I was ordering a few other things and decided to just include it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $6 for this brush, it&#x27;s not that high of quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush.</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush, but there are things that could be better. When it arrived I pulled it out of the box and noticed that by just being in the box that the gold labeling printed on the brush had rubbed off. Also, the handle is rough in some spots while smooth in others. Looks like the molding and printing process of the brush isn&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the performance of the brush. It works fine. The bristles are all the same length (maybe one or two were missed by the machine to shave them down to the same length). A big plus is that I haven&#x27;t lost any of the bristles. They are all stiff enough to comb through my hair, but if you are too rough with brushing your hair you might just scratch your scalp. However, it sure brushes your hair well when you take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the minor defects I would still recommend this brush. I see the rubbing of the lettering off in the box as a blessing in disguise. Nobody wants to be using a brush with &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; written on the back.</li>
            <li> rating is only on the performance of the brush, not including that it had a crack along the side upon receiving or any other physical defects along the hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a soft brush to help maintain my hair when I keep it shorter.  For ethnic hair it&#x27;s a little bit too soft in my opinion.  Next time I&#x27;ll pay a little bit more for the soft brushes by Crown.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for my beard, it&#x27;s not real stiff but it still works very well.</li>
            <li> Very poor Quality. Diane needs to go back to making the OLDER versions of ALL of their hair brush models.</li>
            <li> Hangs out in the car and helps make me look semi presentable before various functions. Hooray for that know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I received this brush as a gift for Christmas. This is not a 100% boar bristle brush. A majority of the bristles are plastic, and that can damage your beard. I thought that a large number of the bristles didn&#x27;t look right, so i cut some off and burned them. The result was melted plastic. No wonder this brush is so cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money, and don&#x27;t damage your beard.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and delivered ahead of the forecast delivery date.  Many Thanks</li>
            <li> This brush is great especially for the price. Usually I experience a lot of irritation around my beard because of soft bristle brushes, but after I started using this brush I don&#x27;t have the need to scratch it anymore.</li>
            <li> terrible quality, wish i never wasted the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of hair brushes and this one is absolutely the best one&lt;br /&gt;so far.  I&#x27;ve washed it several times and it holds up to soap and water&lt;br /&gt;very well. The Boar Bristles have held their firmness.  Great Brush !!</li>
            <li> Nice product - handy size</li>
            <li> Works, bristles don&#x27;t fall out. A little bit more firm/hard than I would have thought for pure boar hair... maybe it is, though.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this Diane brush I bought through Amazon are excellent however the appearance of the wooden handle is a little tacky</li>
            <li> This brush is GREAT.  Makes short work of keeping my beard neat and fits nicely in the kit bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Bristles falls out and I find it in my hair. Not strong as I thought. Does not comb my hair well. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and quality is also, too many loose bristles, ok for occasional use I would not recommend, but a better brush</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for taming the face fuzz</li>
            <li> It is a brush but unfortunately it sheds bristles.  Don&#x27;t know how long this one will last. Made in China.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with beard itch, and it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s a lot gentler than a small hairbrush I was using previously.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in beard itch since using it.</li>
            <li> Not alot you can say about a couple of hair brushes. However, these two brushes are nice and I have not had any problems using them. AS an update to my above review. Since i have now had time to use this brush I don&#x27;t care for it at all. The bristles fall out and I found totally useless and tossed it out.</li>
            <li> this is my first beard brush, and overall I&#x27;m very happy.  Perhaps over time it will become a bit more worn in, but my first impression was that the bristles were stiff, and some seems to fall off and stay in my beard or wax.  Again, I&#x27;m an amateur so it could just be my expectations were off.</li>
            <li> Replaces hair brush I had for 40 years. Hope it lasts half as long, in which case I&#x27;ll be 103</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush! The compact design and quality bristles are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband has a thick course beard and he says this brush helps keep it soft and manageable. He uses it with beard oil every morning</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  My 20 year old brushes are 10 times stronger. Do not think it was real Boar Brush</li>
            <li> Works great on my beard, I use it to groom my facial hair, the bristles are not excessively stiff. So it does not irritate my skin. De​finitely helps to tame my beast of a beard</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help keep my beard groomed and soft.  The bristles immediately starting falling out.  It also has a displeasing odor and it really wasn&#x27;t firm enough to adequately reach my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I ended up with and am very satisifed:  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041TBQUO/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Works great, works right through my beard.  Had a little trouble with shedding extra fibers for the first couple days, but it is great now.</li>
            <li> Quite a few bristles haven fallen out, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Sheds every time and I have to pick the bristled out of my hair. Cheap.</li>
            <li> My dog loves it...this is perfect for my dog he is a rotty and it works great even better than the dog brushes I bought for brushing and desheding. No woofs about it great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Must use to fully appreciate and get the feel for a soft, comfortable beard!  Evenly brushes hair! :)</li>
            <li> Great quality brush, with nice stiff natural bristles. Has no problem reaching the skin beneath my thick beard. My go-to brush.</li>
            <li> This brush does its job! Some bristles have fallen out but overall a nice addition to my fiancé&#x27;s beard care.</li>
            <li> Bought one...like it so much I bought another for the gym.  As I have let my beard grow longer, it has gotten a bit unruly yet I work in a professional environment and don&#x27;t want to look like a mountain man or Unabomber.  The brush is soft enough so it feels great against your skin but firm enough to take on fiercest facial hair.</li>
            <li> Husband loves how nice it keeps his beard.</li>
            <li> this product is not 100% boars bristles....I get static cling from this brush if using it on my hair when dry.  I still like the brush, but it&#x27;s not 100% boars hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 for different bearded gents in my life, works fantastically as a beard brush but for a fraction of the price that most brushes labeled that way sell for!</li>
            <li> I expected some shedding of bristles, but i had 6 entire plugs of bristles fall out on the first use.  Another 2 came out slightly later.  Now my brush looks like it has mange</li>
            <li> I like this brush, easy to hold, using it on two Greyhounds, little hair and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with these brushes shedding bristles.  I own two of them, one for home and one in a travel kit.  They are easy to maintain--I just use standard shampoo to wash them when they begin to get a little oily and collect dust.  They show no ill effects from doing this.  I like how they glide through my hair, unlike other plastic bristle brushes that can pull.  My hair is now thinning and I&#x27;ve started wearing it short (goodbye to my once long, flowing mane) and these brushes seem made for shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the low price and good quality, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush good for people just starting off getting waves</li>
            <li> Bought it for him so he&#x27;ll have one to keep in his travel bag and he uses this one more than his regular one.</li>
