            <li>Have had this before and love it.  </li>

            <li>This has always been one of her favorite fragrances of all time.</li>
            <li>am really enjoying my perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance was so glad I could get it on Amazon</li>
            <li>This is another of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>The appearance of the package illicited some concern, but the contents were fine.</li>

            <li>*SMILE*</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Tuscany, its soft...</li>
            <li>It has a lush blend of blooming flowers and Mediterranean herbs, softened with rich sandalwood and sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>It is soft and warm, not too strong or sharp.  </li>
            <li>This is a first time purchase for me</li>
            <li>This will always be my first choice of scents.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle on a cruise and every time I put it on I&#x27;m cruisin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Tuscany is a very refined fragrance that my wife loves to wear.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it, that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too heavy, but it&#x27;s warm, sensual, not too flowery or too overbearing.</li>
            <li>Every other summer I will switch to Estee Lauder Intuition because it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;summery&amp;#34; floral fragrance, but some summers I just can&#x27;t let go of this smell.  </li>
            <li>Any time I can put a big smile on her face always turns out to beneficial to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this twice, but both times had the same result -- a fabulous smelling fragrance that didn&#x27;t last on my skin.</li>
            <li>Classy!</li>
            <li>I started buying it more online due to the fact the the store that stocks it here only carries it sparingly.</li>
            <li>I really love this perfume and it is really hard to buy on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have used this particular scent for several years.</li>
            <li>This recent bottle appears to be a highly diluted version</li>
            <li>My usual perfume was the original Fendi and since&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needless to say that is was recieved and well liked because its the one she wanted.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure it sticks like glue to some women -- whom I seriously envy!</li>

            <li> Plus, its hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li> The perfume has getting hard to find at the stores but not at Amazon.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time. Wife loves it. I am happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance since it&#x27;s introduction. Men ALWAYS ask me what I&#x27;m wearing or tell me that I smell REALLY good. No need to say anything else!!</li>
            <li> Shipper used an interesting but effective packing method. The appearance of the package illicited some concern, but the contents were fine. Otherwise, a good value on a harder to fine item, prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom she loved it. You can nevervgo wrong with her favorite scent best gift idea in awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years. And its been one of my favorites since. If you wanting a beautiful smell that stays all day than this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Wife was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I started wearing Tuscany when I was 22 and it was a gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I have not stopped wearing it in 14 years! I will never wear any other perfume. I get so many compliments from both men and women. The scent isn&#x27;t too heavy, but it&#x27;s warm, sensual, not too flowery or too overbearing. A little goes a long way though. I just absolutely love it and will never wear another perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume . It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s Tuscany Per Donna, but it doesn&#x27;t love me. I&#x27;ve purchased this twice, but both times had the same result -- a fabulous smelling fragrance that didn&#x27;t last on my skin. While I&#x27;m sure it sticks like glue to some women -- whom I seriously envy! -- it doesn&#x27;t work with everyone, so I&#x27;d advise caution when purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Tuscany off and on for several years. However, lately it has been increasingly more difficult to find locally. This will always be my first choice of scents.  It is soft and warm, not too strong or sharp.  Classy!</li>
            <li> Have had this before and love it.  I requested this as a gift from my husband for Christmas.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent! Everytime I wear it, I get compliments. It smells great! The bottle was very big. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Earthy fragrance one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Every woman needs her scent and this is mine. I found it years ago and never changed.  It is me.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I love the fragrance and I get more compliments when I&#x27;m wearing Tuscany per Donna by Estee Lauder.  I pry they never atop making the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to for years!  I LOVE this fragrance.  I like to wear it in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The price was great and so was the service.  Very Satisfied.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Ihave been using this perfume for years.  It seeems like no matter what other scents I try I keep comming back to Tuscany.  It is wonderful.  I get lots of compliments on this product.  This is the best price any where.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I think it&#x27;s worth every penny!! I bought my first bottle on a cruise and every time I put it on I&#x27;m cruisin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s Birthday gift. Needless to say that is was recieved and well liked because its the one she wanted. I wanted to stay in good health so this is the one I got for her.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Tuscany, its soft... Since I have allergies, its not over powering.  It has a lush blend of blooming flowers and Mediterranean herbs, softened with rich sandalwood and sweet vanilla. It reminds me of  an Italian countryside. This is the only fragrance I purchase or wear.  I always get compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> My favorite! I just wish I could find the lotion as well. Alas - they quit making it years ago.</li>
            <li> Tuscany is an incredible scent that brings compliments from day to night. I am glsd to see it is still available. It is always on the top of my favorite things list!</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance for over 10 years now.  I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes just a few times to switch things up and I keep returning to this one.  It is the PERFECT fall/winter fragrance.  Every other summer I will switch to Estee Lauder Intuition because it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;summery&amp;#34; floral fragrance, but some summers I just can&#x27;t let go of this smell.  I don&#x27;t know anyone else who wears it (or has even heard of it), so I know I have a unique scent.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent for years. It is very difficult to find in stores now. This was a great price. I have to keep it away from my daughter as she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Bought this as christmas gift and never showed and was returned my money after 4 weeks, very disappointed and will next time buy my perfume eslwhere....</li>
            <li> I ordered Tuscany Per Donna Eau De Parfum&lt;br /&gt;product was delivered promptly and was as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Tuscany is an oriental, spicy, sensuous fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; My usual perfume was the original Fendi and since&lt;br /&gt; they no longer make it I looked for a similar&lt;br /&gt; fragrance.  People ask me &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tuscany gets the compliments !!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze or cough. Plus, its hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li> Daughter-in-Law loved it and was so very surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift. She cannot find this which is her fav cologne so it was a big surprise that I could find it for her! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product. I have used this particular scent for several years. This recent bottle appears to be a highly diluted version</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this fragrance for the friend. She adores it, but since it&#x27;s classic collection it is not easy to find it where she lives. She was beyond happy once she got it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday. This has always been one of her favorite fragrances of all time. The perfume has getting hard to find at the stores but not at Amazon. Any time I can put a big smile on her face always turns out to beneficial to me.</li>
            <li> I liked the service fast and reliable.  the size of my bottle was what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really enjoying my perfume.</li>
            <li> I have probably reviewed this before, since I buy it all the time. I started buying it more online due to the fact the the store that stocks it here only carries it sparingly. It last a long time, but when you want it, you want it.  I have used this perfume about as long as they have made it and I hope they never stop.</li>
            <li> Unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever worn.  Just started wearing it and I like it.  It&#x27;s just a little heavy for summer here in the south.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance was so glad I could get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is another of my favorite perfumes.  I was very happy to find it here reasonably priced and shipped very quickly!</li>
