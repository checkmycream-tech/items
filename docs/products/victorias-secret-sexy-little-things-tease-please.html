            <li>delightful.</li>
            <li>Why does VS always have to D/C their best smelling scents!!</li>

            <li>Smells awesome and came quick!!</li>
            <li>Was happy when I was able to find it again!</li>
            <li>Purchased this at VS on sale and loved the scent and the fact it lasted compared to others.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from men and women when I wear this on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find more at a great price.</li>
            <li>So satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Item shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>Love the product BUT.</li>
            <li>in love with this ent and it looks gorg on my vanity</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about the scent, I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful that I was able to get this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance although I like the body spray version better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow it is a lovely clean scent</li>
            <li>It was easy to order and I found exactly what I wanted and the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very girly girl, and I have to preface this by saying this scent is somewhat unisex, not distinctly feminine, more of what I hoped Kate Walsh&#x27;s Boyfriend would smell like lol.</li>
            <li>It is a &amp;#34;safe fragrance&amp;#34; for those who want to smell good but are afraid of perfume (like a more fun younger sister to Amazing Grace by Philosophy) , this doesn&#x27;t seem to develop on my skin into distinct notes, it just smells great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something very special about the fragrance - it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or generic.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I left in a bag and most spilled out.</li>
            <li>Good sweet atmosphere, with its super good mood all day long, I really like this product, and it is difficult to buy it now</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t squirt out very well</li>
            <li>My husband found this and liked it, I was shocked when I liked it as well,</li>
            <li>Item was brand new and smells just like I remember it.</li>
            <li>It smells just like the body spray scent but last much longer than the body spray.</li>

            <li> A friend showed hers to me and I had to track it down online as it was just a limited edition.</li>
            <li> , my friend tried to use it up when I let her borrow it, it is soft but noticeable, doesn&#x27;t last unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It was open and half of it spilled out all over the box  :/</li>
            <li> I bought the body spray last year but they quickly discontinued this scent :(</li>
            <li> Downside is that it is discontinued, so you&#x27;d better snatch it up while you can, hopefully Victoria&#x27;s Secret will bring it back? :(</li>
            <li> No thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Victoria Secret should bring this fragrance back!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is not real smells nothing like the Victoria&#x27;s Secret tease</li>
            <li> Why Victoria Secret discontinued this jewel of a fragrance</li>
            <li> Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrances have never impressed me until this one.</li>
            <li> Expired and smelled really bad.</li>

            <li> Expired and smelled really bad. I would rather buy dollar store perfume than wear this. When I asked for a return my only option was to send it back for another one. No thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about the scent, I love it. My issue is with the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t squirt out very well and it seems to find a way of leaking out when I twist it to the on position.</li>

            <li> Product is not real smells nothing like the Victoria&#x27;s Secret tease please</li>
            <li> Why Victoria Secret discontinued this jewel of a fragrance I&#x27;ll never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three. Two as gifts and one as an air freshener for my bachelor pad. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very delightful. Reminds me of Faith Hill&#x27;s &amp;#34;Soul to Soul&amp;#34; but lighter, airier, different.</li>
            <li> I love this but when I received it the bottle had leaked out into the box and the pump spray does not work so I need to find a different bottle to put the remaining perfume into.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance although I like the body spray version better. Victoria Secret should bring this fragrance back!!!!!</li>
            <li> Item was brand new and smells just like I remember it. Item shipped very quickly!</li>
