            <li>The 3 pack was a good value.</li>
            <li>nothing fancy, just a good product.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product was good and buying in bulk saved some money since my mom always uses this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But I like to save money, so decided to try it - and am flat-out amazed at how good it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to always hydrate your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, smells good, works and</li>
            <li>It felt so good on my face that I decided to use it all over after a shower...</li>
            <li>I decided to try Ponds after hearing good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This lotion feels so good and velvety going on.</li>
            <li>Even though it feels so good that you will want to put it on your neck.</li>
            <li>I honestly think the reaction was from the fragrance (very strong!).</li>
            <li>I love Ponds and am happy with the delivery and the product.</li>
            <li>I can put it on right after showering and it&#x27;s perfect to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 40+ years and have never found better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin cream of all time!  </li>
            <li>I was so hoping to love this!</li>
            <li>, I love my Ponds!</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time and I am impressed!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>It a large jar, and it is excellent for aging, drying skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am will repet the nice experience</li>
            <li>Nice, it is</li>
            <li>And at night I love to layer it on and massage it as it soaks in, it feels so good</li>
            <li>It has some nice ingredients in it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li>so when I find soemthing that works, I&#x27;m thrilled and stick with it.</li>
            <li>Nice both for fragrance and for functionality</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Very strong flowery odor, and</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING :]  </li>
            <li>This made my face so soft and dewy and made a great face primer for makeup as well!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how true that information was, but I find pond&#x27;s to be just as good.</li>
            <li>It is very light, like a lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it under very light makeup and people are always asking me how I get my skin to look so dewy.</li>
            <li>it cost much more.</li>
            <li>She had used Pond&#x27;s for many years.  </li>
            <li>so I started looking for a more aggressive face cream.</li>
            <li>The Pond&#x27;s faithful convinced me to try this cream - and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>Before this, my sister had okay</li>
            <li>Now her skin is glowing, smooth, ULTRA SIKLY and honestly...</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t stop touching it</li>
            <li>The texture is thinner than Clarin&#x27;s, but it hydrates better than the Clarin&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>:) If you want a great eye makeup remover that is gentle and gets the job done, well here you have it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer and</li>
            <li>My skin love it and glow.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I love Ponds.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li>The skin looks exceptionally smooth!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>She love</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I could purchase it in CVS, but Amazon price was better</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>As my skincare needs have changed and I&#x27;ve come to need a more moisturizing \\&quot;official\\&quot; night cream, Pond&#x27;s will be it.  </li>
            <li>Been using the product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face cream</li>
            <li>For me, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And...well, you get the point! :-)  </li>
            <li>I started using my moms, but I had to get my own because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>A great, classic skin cream.</li>
            <li>I got them from BJ before and my mother-in-law loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is pretty good as well for 3-10.1 oz containers.  </li>
            <li>Large package, good value for money.</li>
            <li>No stinging or burning sensations, which is great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a lot of cons compared to the pros, but the two were the most important points of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, not slimy, not sticky; there&#x27;s no weird residue, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that my boyfriend (who also has really oily skin) swears by it as well.</li>
            <li>I started to use it right away and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Clinique was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a bit overwhelming sometimes.</li>
            <li>trio is a great bargain for a great product; I highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li>and I told him, he said it was fine.</li>
            <li>Somehow, it cleans the gunk out of my pores and did something with my fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It smells like baby lotion, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Very soft and feels good when applied.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to flake (yes, despite the acne, go figure!), and this has reduced the flaking by probably 70% - a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>For the money, I can see why people love it but for me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed by this humble cream.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling incredibly smooth and silky</li>
            <li>Does a FABULOUS job of hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It truly is silky and so smooth.</li>
            <li>Greasy, but smooth.</li>
            <li>Wish they made it in fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy/</li>
            <li>My mom used this product back 50 years ago and I am just happy using it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m in the latter camp, as I honestly have never had a moisturizer this effective.</li>
            <li>- I figure it must be pretty good if she goes through so much of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d passed Ponds up in the cosmetics aisles for years because that&#x27;s what my mother used and thought surely something new and innovative had been made since then.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for the past 8 years and my face looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>It is way too rich to use during the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li>Ponds is a rich cream without being greasy and I&#x27;ve yet to find another product that works as well.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin,</li>
            <li>I have NEVER FELT SUCH BEAUTIFUL, SOFT, SILKY, CREAMY, SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants beautifully hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Ponds is a tried and true item that my family has used for generations.</li>
            <li>I came over here looking at the reviews and as I started reading I realized that I love this product that I have been using for some time, but I thought this whole time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a 4.5, only because when a product is this good you have to nitpick its flaws.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you - cold cream is the BEST facial moisturizer and it does a great job at loosening makeup residue!  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I real want to love it.  </li>
            <li>What more do we need really?</li>
            <li>Both are feeling much softer and looking better.</li>
            <li>Still having a pimple once in a while, but not bad like before.    </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she says that it has done her very well to her skin, and the price is very reasonable compared to some other creams, she is very happy.</li>
            <li>I used to have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth, and break out free!</li>
            <li>Then time came when I&#x27;ve been getting more pimples and started having more obvious blemishes on the face.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out a good way to prevent my dry skin for a while.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moist and I don&#x27;t seem to notice my fine lines as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>Thanks and hoping you will always have this available.</li>
            <li>Great face cream for harsh winter weather</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh after applying.</li>
            <li>All that I needed to do was use a generous amount of Ponds at night and massage until the cream gets absorbed, wipe off excess.  </li>
            <li>My powdered makeup looks so much more natural over this lotion than the lotions I had tried before.</li>
            <li>Since it is a bit more costly, I&#x27;ve tried many other face moisturizers: name brand, organic, recommended by others, ceraphil.., ect.</li>
            <li>: no burning, it penetrated my skin, felt silky and dewy -- but not greasy -- and I could see and feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>, is just right in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>So for me it wasn&#x27;t the right</li>
            <li>Three huge jars, and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the first jar!!</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling smooth and silky with a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The box came and everything looked okay except that packing could have been a little better to prevent the product from bumping around.</li>
            <li>but I ALWAYS come back to using good old Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I do want to complain about the shipping holding period of the subscribe &amp; Save order - what is the point to keep subscribe &amp; Save orders on hold for more than one month but ship regular orders right away?</li>
            <li>but this one&#x27;s very neutral and goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>We all have different skin types and some just work better on others.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion my skin seems to love, I was raised using it.</li>
            <li>For a reasonable price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>B001E96NEI Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, SPF 45, 1.7 Ounce (</li>
            <li>For a brief moment I sas able to buy this, but eventually the manufacturer changed it to something else.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of hours, I was already aware of my skin flaking off in the driest spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will more than likely order it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products over the years, but I&#x27;d always go back to Clinique.  </li>
            <li>The skin was hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite facial moisturizer out of everything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love it this is all I buy, and cant buy enough.</li>
            <li>My face is nourished, soft, smooth and</li>
            <li>&#x27;s blue top at night and Oil of Olay with spf every morning.  </li>
            <li>The 3 jars lasted more than four years, I&#x27;m finally back to reorder!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and live in an incredibly dry climate and this cream is great for the money.</li>
            <li>It applies really smoothly and leaves your skin feeling very dewy and soft, not greasy whatsoever.</li>
            <li>because it moisturizes your skin very well, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and it does actually give your skin a healthy glow -</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t help but wonder what is it that makes we women rush out to buy the latest and greatest - when half the products that came out only a few years ago don&#x27;t even exist anymore.  </li>
            <li>I attribute the fact that my face is aging gracefully (very few wrinkles and good tone) to Ponds and no tanning.  </li>
            <li>For more than 12 hours, I don&#x27;t have to do any touch up throughout the day and don&#x27;t feel any dry or tightness around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>From my great grandmother on down, this cream has been the fountain of youth for my female family members for years.  </li>
            <li>I use this product as a general facial moisturizer and it works great, especially at night.</li>
            <li>I discovered Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream about a month ago, and my skin has not looked this good since my semester in Southern France!</li>
            <li>The good news is that the old lady fragrance doesn&#x27;t follow you around, and if you find it greasy then just put less on or grab a towel and wipe some off.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes dry skin feel soft and supple and has a nice fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The best part: my acne has reduced immensely - like 80%, at least!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how my skin looks and feels, and now use makeup only very lightly (mostly tinted moisturizer with SPF, and a little powder blush and light bronzing powder), or not at all on casual days, because my skin looks so good</li>
            <li>This is very affordable, and i have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I kept wondering why I really didn&#x27;t feel I needed that Olay night cream after using this product.</li>
            <li>These at the stores like Walmart and Target go for as much as 12.99 just for one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much smoother and lighter then others.</li>
            <li>A tried and true product that is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>this works wonders on it without making you feel as if you&#x27;re ready to be roasted.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li>I grew up with Ponds Cleansing Cream in the house, which my mother used, and thought this moisturizer looked really old-fashioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my &#x27;every day&#x27; moisturizer, it goes on smooth, feels soft on my skin and has a nice, delicate scent.  </li>
            <li>I would look really greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pond&#x27;s my whole life, as did my mother and grandmother before me.  </li>
            <li>and I do buy this in bulk as I use this for whole body as a body cream.</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for this product..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a treat.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage.  </li>
            <li>She gets really cranky when she runs out of it.</li>
            <li>This was bought when you only had to have a $25 purchase to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Now that amazon is collecting sales tax I won&#x27;t be buying as much from them.</li>
            <li>I have very troublesome skin</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So much so that I have wondered whether its the lotion, or have passed through an acne stage.</li>
            <li>But given how my skin feels with this lotion, I really think its the lotion.</li>
            <li>Then one day it became combination of super oily and super dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-4 months now, and my skin is transformed: dewy, radiant, lush, smooth, plump and velvety soft.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get not only the larger size but 3 of them for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>It seemed to be the only thing that removed the Kohl from my eyes and leave my face so clean.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day - I dab on only a tiny bit in the morning before make up (you really don&#x27;t need much), and apply a much more generous amount at night before bedtime.</li>
            <li>That used to happen to me badly, until someone advised me to switch to rich cream moisturizers - and my skin cleared up and started looking beautiful.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It blends in quickly and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell, but to me is not bad</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find Clarin&#x27;s HydraQuench Rich Cream (for very dry skin or cold climates)</li>
            <li>nothing comes close to the effectiveness and results of a dry skin transforming to smooth one.</li>
            <li>Its so gentle and works well as a nice thick moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I put this cream on top of my facial lotion (IOPE Moisture Lasting by AmorePacific) in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I roomed at a hotel with an older woman at a wedding</li>
            <li>I have never been particular with how my skin looked like.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this cream from a local store, but just recently started buying it from Amazon because it&#x27;s a better value.</li>
            <li>Also its a classic that has been there from my grandmas time.</li>
            <li>I also use it all over my neck and upper chest, and they are fabulously soft and smooth, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>My face actually had a mild reaction to it within about two minutes...</li>
            <li>so I headed over to the one open supermarket and fortunately there was old faithful - Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I do recommend it highly....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe in those high price skin care products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did, and 4 years later I am still an avid user!</li>
            <li>At most I just need a little sun protection and hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also can work a little makeup on top of it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a dry climate, even people with oily skin need to use rich moisturizers, as otherwise the dryness dries the surface of the skin, trapping oils and making the skin break out.</li>
            <li>And some might not like that it has mineral oil, but others think the bad rap about mineral oil is a myth, and regard mineral oil as one of the best things for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep this and use it as a night cream, where it doesn&#x27;t matter if my skin has absorbed enough it or not.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I have been able to find that keeps my skin from being so dry</li>
            <li>This product is PERFECT for my needs and, since a little goes a long way, will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and no strong odor to contend with.</li>
            <li>the one product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I turned 41, my skin became super dry.  </li>
            <li>After a few minutes it actually started to feel really nice.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to acne breakouts, so I was really worried about ordering this product at the posted price and potentially wasting the money along with three jars of product.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and very very surprised it worked on her</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I am very sensitive to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Cetaphil with SPF 15, but it made my skin burn and just sat on top of my skin like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old and normally have combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I simply ADORE Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream, and strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does do a fantastic job of treating my dry areas, but I have also begun to break out recently</li>
            <li>So I looked around for something new, and was surprised to find this inexpensive Ponds Dry Skin Cream listed on a beauty website alongside far more expensive creams as being a top moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Just the right cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>After trying many other brands for my dry complexion</li>
            <li>My mother just died at 92 and had the  complexion of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li>my skin was soft and glowing.   </li>
            <li>This does have a fragrance to it, I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I apply this on my face after shower before going to bed and leaves my skin soft and hydrated and always get a compliment if I go to a professional dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is probably the only cream that keeps my skin hydrated for the whole day.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t work for my acne-prone, sensitive, eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say if you have very reactive facial skin, you might need to stick with fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li>Yes it has an old lady fragrance, but you know what...</li>
            <li>Expensive skin creams move over - who needs them when you can get such a great cream for such a reasonable price?</li>
            <li>This is my one and only skincare cream..for face, and whole body...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ultra soft and glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s products don&#x27;t change and mature women who&#x27;ve used them for years swear by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has sensitive skin too, but this cream didn&#x27;t give him any rashes.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to be carded buying cigarettes at 30 years old then don&#x27;t use Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Only hours later, my skin feels dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is mild, greasier and longer-lasting than a lotion but not nearly as greasy as Vaseline would be--in short</li>
            <li>I tried this product for about 2 months and it just wasn&#x27;t creamy enough for my super dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>When I turned 40 a couple of years ago, I started getting red blotchy patches of super dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard older women swear by this cream as the ultimate wrinkle fighter!</li>
            <li>Yes, still the same classic one as I have known it.</li>
            <li>, it came from The New Mall with extra shipping.</li>
            <li>It stung, but my skin is so dry that really any liquid stings.</li>
            <li>Really help moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li>More expensive all-around in the end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old, and have been using Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream since my freshman year of college.</li>
            <li>Not totally clear yet, but significantly improved without use of other products.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally very oily skin, so I was wary about applying something that would make my face even more oily looking.</li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing: a little goes a long way, so three jars are going to last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I have been using ponds for over 20 years and will use no other</li>
            <li>Both after washing the face with facial bar, nothing particular nor specific.  </li>
            <li>Then I discovered Pond&#x27;s The Caring classic Dry Skin Cream.  </li>
            <li>I will finish what&#x27;s left in the container, but it&#x27;s up in the air as far as to whether or not i will repurchase it.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li>But I personally don&#x27;t want people near my face thinking \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li>and she loaned me hers and swore by the cold cream, so I tried it and loved it and bought what I thought was it.   </li>
            <li>But every time I use this product I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing grease onto my face, although that feeling goes away after a few minutes when the moisturizer is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I tired it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive this winter and Ponds has allowed me to keep it soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Other times, this face cream can be quite greasy and it breaks me out if I use too much.</li>
            <li>I bought a tub of cream and came right home and used a little facial scrub and then slathered it on while my face was still moist.  </li>
            <li>My skin is as dry as the Sahara desert, but also acne prone and very sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (sensitive, oily, dry) and</li>
            <li>This lotion fixed my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>My skin was really dry during the winter time and my roomate suggested I try her Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream since I was a young teen,  and recommend it to everyone with dry skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is so highly fragranced that my allergies went through the roof with the eyes watering and dark circles.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy here in New Jersey and I&#x27;ve been pouring out money on food and other incidentals daily since there&#x27;s no electric</li>
            <li>If I feel super dry during the day, I&#x27;ve used this in small doses; I feel it&#x27;s a nice extra dose of hydration in a day situation where I know it won&#x27;t make my skin go crazy and produce a ton of oil.</li>

            <li> nothing fancy, just a good product.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product was good and buying in bulk saved some money since my mom always uses this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But I like to save money, so decided to try it - and am flat-out amazed at how good it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to always hydrate your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, smells good, works and</li>
            <li> It felt so good on my face that I decided to use it all over after a shower...</li>
            <li> I decided to try Ponds after hearing good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so good and velvety going on.</li>
            <li> Even though it feels so good that you will want to put it on your neck.</li>
            <li> I honestly think the reaction was from the fragrance (very strong!).</li>
            <li> I love Ponds and am happy with the delivery and the product.</li>
            <li> I can put it on right after showering and it&#x27;s perfect to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 40+ years and have never found better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream of all time!  </li>
            <li> I was so hoping to love this!</li>
            <li> , I love my Ponds!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li> It a large jar, and it is excellent for aging, drying skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am will repet the nice experience</li>
            <li> Nice, it is</li>
            <li> And at night I love to layer it on and massage it as it soaks in, it feels so good</li>
            <li> It has some nice ingredients in it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> so when I find soemthing that works, I&#x27;m thrilled and stick with it.</li>
            <li> Nice both for fragrance and for functionality</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Very strong flowery odor, and</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING :]  </li>
            <li> This made my face so soft and dewy and made a great face primer for makeup as well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how true that information was, but I find pond&#x27;s to be just as good.</li>
            <li> It is very light, like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it under very light makeup and people are always asking me how I get my skin to look so dewy.</li>
            <li> it cost much more.</li>
            <li> She had used Pond&#x27;s for many years.  </li>
            <li> so I started looking for a more aggressive face cream.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s faithful convinced me to try this cream - and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Before this, my sister had okay</li>
            <li> Now her skin is glowing, smooth, ULTRA SIKLY and honestly...</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t stop touching it</li>
            <li> The texture is thinner than Clarin&#x27;s, but it hydrates better than the Clarin&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> :) If you want a great eye makeup remover that is gentle and gets the job done, well here you have it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and</li>
            <li> My skin love it and glow.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I love Ponds.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> The skin looks exceptionally smooth!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> She love</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I could purchase it in CVS, but Amazon price was better</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> As my skincare needs have changed and I&#x27;ve come to need a more moisturizing \\&quot;official\\&quot; night cream, Pond&#x27;s will be it.  </li>
            <li> Been using the product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream</li>
            <li> For me, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And...well, you get the point! :-)  </li>
            <li> I started using my moms, but I had to get my own because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> A great, classic skin cream.</li>
            <li> I got them from BJ before and my mother-in-law loved it very much.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is pretty good as well for 3-10.1 oz containers.  </li>
            <li> Large package, good value for money.</li>
            <li> No stinging or burning sensations, which is great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a lot of cons compared to the pros, but the two were the most important points of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, not slimy, not sticky; there&#x27;s no weird residue, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that my boyfriend (who also has really oily skin) swears by it as well.</li>
            <li> I started to use it right away and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Clinique was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a bit overwhelming sometimes.</li>
            <li> trio is a great bargain for a great product; I highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> and I told him, he said it was fine.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it cleans the gunk out of my pores and did something with my fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It smells like baby lotion, which is fine.</li>
            <li> Very soft and feels good when applied.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to flake (yes, despite the acne, go figure!), and this has reduced the flaking by probably 70% - a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> For the money, I can see why people love it but for me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this humble cream.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling incredibly smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Does a FABULOUS job of hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It truly is silky and so smooth.</li>
            <li> Greasy, but smooth.</li>
            <li> Wish they made it in fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy/</li>
            <li> My mom used this product back 50 years ago and I am just happy using it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m in the latter camp, as I honestly have never had a moisturizer this effective.</li>
            <li> - I figure it must be pretty good if she goes through so much of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d passed Ponds up in the cosmetics aisles for years because that&#x27;s what my mother used and thought surely something new and innovative had been made since then.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past 8 years and my face looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> It is way too rich to use during the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li> Ponds is a rich cream without being greasy and I&#x27;ve yet to find another product that works as well.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin,</li>
            <li> I have NEVER FELT SUCH BEAUTIFUL, SOFT, SILKY, CREAMY, SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants beautifully hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Ponds is a tried and true item that my family has used for generations.</li>
            <li> I came over here looking at the reviews and as I started reading I realized that I love this product that I have been using for some time, but I thought this whole time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 4.5, only because when a product is this good you have to nitpick its flaws.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you - cold cream is the BEST facial moisturizer and it does a great job at loosening makeup residue!  </li>
            <li> Love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I real want to love it.  </li>
            <li> What more do we need really?</li>
            <li> Both are feeling much softer and looking better.</li>
            <li> Still having a pimple once in a while, but not bad like before.    </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she says that it has done her very well to her skin, and the price is very reasonable compared to some other creams, she is very happy.</li>
            <li> I used to have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth, and break out free!</li>
            <li> Then time came when I&#x27;ve been getting more pimples and started having more obvious blemishes on the face.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out a good way to prevent my dry skin for a while.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and I don&#x27;t seem to notice my fine lines as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> Thanks and hoping you will always have this available.</li>
            <li> Great face cream for harsh winter weather</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh after applying.</li>
            <li> All that I needed to do was use a generous amount of Ponds at night and massage until the cream gets absorbed, wipe off excess.  </li>
            <li> My powdered makeup looks so much more natural over this lotion than the lotions I had tried before.</li>
            <li> Since it is a bit more costly, I&#x27;ve tried many other face moisturizers: name brand, organic, recommended by others, ceraphil.., ect.</li>
            <li> : no burning, it penetrated my skin, felt silky and dewy -- but not greasy -- and I could see and feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> , is just right in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> So for me it wasn&#x27;t the right</li>
            <li> Three huge jars, and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the first jar!!</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling smooth and silky with a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The box came and everything looked okay except that packing could have been a little better to prevent the product from bumping around.</li>
            <li> but I ALWAYS come back to using good old Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I do want to complain about the shipping holding period of the subscribe &amp; Save order - what is the point to keep subscribe &amp; Save orders on hold for more than one month but ship regular orders right away?</li>
            <li> but this one&#x27;s very neutral and goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> We all have different skin types and some just work better on others.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion my skin seems to love, I was raised using it.</li>
            <li> For a reasonable price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> B001E96NEI Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, SPF 45, 1.7 Ounce (</li>
            <li> For a brief moment I sas able to buy this, but eventually the manufacturer changed it to something else.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of hours, I was already aware of my skin flaking off in the driest spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will more than likely order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products over the years, but I&#x27;d always go back to Clinique.  </li>
            <li> The skin was hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite facial moisturizer out of everything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it this is all I buy, and cant buy enough.</li>
            <li> My face is nourished, soft, smooth and</li>
            <li> &#x27;s blue top at night and Oil of Olay with spf every morning.  </li>
            <li> The 3 jars lasted more than four years, I&#x27;m finally back to reorder!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and live in an incredibly dry climate and this cream is great for the money.</li>
            <li> It applies really smoothly and leaves your skin feeling very dewy and soft, not greasy whatsoever.</li>
            <li> because it moisturizes your skin very well, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and it does actually give your skin a healthy glow -</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t help but wonder what is it that makes we women rush out to buy the latest and greatest - when half the products that came out only a few years ago don&#x27;t even exist anymore.  </li>
            <li> I attribute the fact that my face is aging gracefully (very few wrinkles and good tone) to Ponds and no tanning.  </li>
            <li> For more than 12 hours, I don&#x27;t have to do any touch up throughout the day and don&#x27;t feel any dry or tightness around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> From my great grandmother on down, this cream has been the fountain of youth for my female family members for years.  </li>
            <li> I use this product as a general facial moisturizer and it works great, especially at night.</li>
            <li> I discovered Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream about a month ago, and my skin has not looked this good since my semester in Southern France!</li>
            <li> The good news is that the old lady fragrance doesn&#x27;t follow you around, and if you find it greasy then just put less on or grab a towel and wipe some off.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes dry skin feel soft and supple and has a nice fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The best part: my acne has reduced immensely - like 80%, at least!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how my skin looks and feels, and now use makeup only very lightly (mostly tinted moisturizer with SPF, and a little powder blush and light bronzing powder), or not at all on casual days, because my skin looks so good</li>
            <li> This is very affordable, and i have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I kept wondering why I really didn&#x27;t feel I needed that Olay night cream after using this product.</li>
            <li> These at the stores like Walmart and Target go for as much as 12.99 just for one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smoother and lighter then others.</li>
            <li> A tried and true product that is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> this works wonders on it without making you feel as if you&#x27;re ready to be roasted.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Ponds Cleansing Cream in the house, which my mother used, and thought this moisturizer looked really old-fashioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my &#x27;every day&#x27; moisturizer, it goes on smooth, feels soft on my skin and has a nice, delicate scent.  </li>
            <li> I would look really greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pond&#x27;s my whole life, as did my mother and grandmother before me.  </li>
            <li> and I do buy this in bulk as I use this for whole body as a body cream.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon for this product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a treat.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage.  </li>
            <li> She gets really cranky when she runs out of it.</li>
            <li> This was bought when you only had to have a $25 purchase to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Now that amazon is collecting sales tax I won&#x27;t be buying as much from them.</li>
            <li> I have very troublesome skin</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have wondered whether its the lotion, or have passed through an acne stage.</li>
            <li> But given how my skin feels with this lotion, I really think its the lotion.</li>
            <li> Then one day it became combination of super oily and super dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-4 months now, and my skin is transformed: dewy, radiant, lush, smooth, plump and velvety soft.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get not only the larger size but 3 of them for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> It seemed to be the only thing that removed the Kohl from my eyes and leave my face so clean.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day - I dab on only a tiny bit in the morning before make up (you really don&#x27;t need much), and apply a much more generous amount at night before bedtime.</li>
            <li> That used to happen to me badly, until someone advised me to switch to rich cream moisturizers - and my skin cleared up and started looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It blends in quickly and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell, but to me is not bad</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find Clarin&#x27;s HydraQuench Rich Cream (for very dry skin or cold climates)</li>
            <li> nothing comes close to the effectiveness and results of a dry skin transforming to smooth one.</li>
            <li> Its so gentle and works well as a nice thick moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I put this cream on top of my facial lotion (IOPE Moisture Lasting by AmorePacific) in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I roomed at a hotel with an older woman at a wedding</li>
            <li> I have never been particular with how my skin looked like.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this cream from a local store, but just recently started buying it from Amazon because it&#x27;s a better value.</li>
            <li> Also its a classic that has been there from my grandmas time.</li>
            <li> I also use it all over my neck and upper chest, and they are fabulously soft and smooth, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> My face actually had a mild reaction to it within about two minutes...</li>
            <li> so I headed over to the one open supermarket and fortunately there was old faithful - Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I do recommend it highly....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in those high price skin care products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did, and 4 years later I am still an avid user!</li>
            <li> At most I just need a little sun protection and hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also can work a little makeup on top of it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a dry climate, even people with oily skin need to use rich moisturizers, as otherwise the dryness dries the surface of the skin, trapping oils and making the skin break out.</li>
            <li> And some might not like that it has mineral oil, but others think the bad rap about mineral oil is a myth, and regard mineral oil as one of the best things for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep this and use it as a night cream, where it doesn&#x27;t matter if my skin has absorbed enough it or not.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have been able to find that keeps my skin from being so dry</li>
            <li> This product is PERFECT for my needs and, since a little goes a long way, will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and no strong odor to contend with.</li>
            <li> the one product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I turned 41, my skin became super dry.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes it actually started to feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to acne breakouts, so I was really worried about ordering this product at the posted price and potentially wasting the money along with three jars of product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and very very surprised it worked on her</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I am very sensitive to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Cetaphil with SPF 15, but it made my skin burn and just sat on top of my skin like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and normally have combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I simply ADORE Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream, and strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does do a fantastic job of treating my dry areas, but I have also begun to break out recently</li>
            <li> So I looked around for something new, and was surprised to find this inexpensive Ponds Dry Skin Cream listed on a beauty website alongside far more expensive creams as being a top moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just the right cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> After trying many other brands for my dry complexion</li>
            <li> My mother just died at 92 and had the  complexion of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li> my skin was soft and glowing.   </li>
            <li> This does have a fragrance to it, I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I apply this on my face after shower before going to bed and leaves my skin soft and hydrated and always get a compliment if I go to a professional dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably the only cream that keeps my skin hydrated for the whole day.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t work for my acne-prone, sensitive, eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you have very reactive facial skin, you might need to stick with fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li> Yes it has an old lady fragrance, but you know what...</li>
            <li> Expensive skin creams move over - who needs them when you can get such a great cream for such a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> This is my one and only skincare cream..for face, and whole body...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ultra soft and glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s products don&#x27;t change and mature women who&#x27;ve used them for years swear by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has sensitive skin too, but this cream didn&#x27;t give him any rashes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to be carded buying cigarettes at 30 years old then don&#x27;t use Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Only hours later, my skin feels dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is mild, greasier and longer-lasting than a lotion but not nearly as greasy as Vaseline would be--in short</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about 2 months and it just wasn&#x27;t creamy enough for my super dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> When I turned 40 a couple of years ago, I started getting red blotchy patches of super dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard older women swear by this cream as the ultimate wrinkle fighter!</li>
            <li> Yes, still the same classic one as I have known it.</li>
            <li> , it came from The New Mall with extra shipping.</li>
            <li> It stung, but my skin is so dry that really any liquid stings.</li>
            <li> Really help moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> More expensive all-around in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, and have been using Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream since my freshman year of college.</li>
            <li> Not totally clear yet, but significantly improved without use of other products.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very oily skin, so I was wary about applying something that would make my face even more oily looking.</li>
            <li> Oh, one more thing: a little goes a long way, so three jars are going to last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I have been using ponds for over 20 years and will use no other</li>
            <li> Both after washing the face with facial bar, nothing particular nor specific.  </li>
            <li> Then I discovered Pond&#x27;s The Caring classic Dry Skin Cream.  </li>
            <li> I will finish what&#x27;s left in the container, but it&#x27;s up in the air as far as to whether or not i will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> But I personally don&#x27;t want people near my face thinking \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li> and she loaned me hers and swore by the cold cream, so I tried it and loved it and bought what I thought was it.   </li>
            <li> But every time I use this product I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing grease onto my face, although that feeling goes away after a few minutes when the moisturizer is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I tired it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive this winter and Ponds has allowed me to keep it soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Other times, this face cream can be quite greasy and it breaks me out if I use too much.</li>
            <li> I bought a tub of cream and came right home and used a little facial scrub and then slathered it on while my face was still moist.  </li>
            <li> My skin is as dry as the Sahara desert, but also acne prone and very sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (sensitive, oily, dry) and</li>
            <li> This lotion fixed my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> My skin was really dry during the winter time and my roomate suggested I try her Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream since I was a young teen,  and recommend it to everyone with dry skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is so highly fragranced that my allergies went through the roof with the eyes watering and dark circles.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy here in New Jersey and I&#x27;ve been pouring out money on food and other incidentals daily since there&#x27;s no electric</li>
            <li> If I feel super dry during the day, I&#x27;ve used this in small doses; I feel it&#x27;s a nice extra dose of hydration in a day situation where I know it won&#x27;t make my skin go crazy and produce a ton of oil.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this classic product that my mom used when I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> I have had oily skin my entire life but now, in the sixth month of my second pregnancy, I am experiencing very dry patches of skin on my forehead and my upper cheeks on either side of my nose.</li>
            <li> So I began to try to not wear makeup as much, but have very pale skin and need some extra help so as not to look sickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried other more expensive facial creams and they did not work, so I went back to Ponds.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin was much less visible, stopped itching and looked and felt almost normal.</li>
            <li> It even works on my dry, chapped hands that have been ravaged from dish-washing and constant hand-sanitizer use -- and it doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> I used the Ponds cold cream back in the Philippines, and it also takes off more dirt that does not come off with just washing the face.</li>
            <li> I had dry skin, especially during colder seasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the third generation to use Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> This one is the only one that protects my dry skin well.</li>
            <li> just minutes later I had a fresh and dewy complexion without the shine that mineral oil can leave behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Europe, I once bought this POND&#x27;S Dry Skin Cream for my wife from the USA, since then she only uses this cream, I again ordered six POND&#x27;S Dry Skin Cream, 10.1-oz..</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time I&#x27;ve been using it a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also afan of Dove Pink Bar for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Ugh... I mean, it&#x27;s really dated smelling.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as an everyday make up remover for my eyes, no stinging no mess.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin all year long.</li>
            <li> I wish it did not have parabens, but the other creams I have tried that do not are just not the same.  </li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize my face all day long!</li>
            <li> I even tried Eucerin for severely dry skin -- no burning, and it saturated, but</li>
            <li> These are both a greasy type of lotion I would recommend this for anyone with skin like mine that is ultra dry all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have always used Ponds Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> I received the Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream that I bought for my mom.</li>
            <li> My mom, who doesn&#x27;t have eczema, had been using Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream and said I should give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you get dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been using POND&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream for some years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream for years and continue to like it.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes use it on my shins if they seem dry.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone I&#x27;ve recommended it to loves it, and we all have a range of quite dry to oily skin.</li>
            <li> it was dry all over again.</li>
            <li> I figured that if the Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream caused my face to break out, I would just return it.</li>
            <li> I dug out this skin cream to address some of the dry patches that are beginning to appear around my nose and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t stand the dry patch</li>
            <li> have extremely dry skin and have tried everything, so I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> Says it keeps her dry skin moist.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizing lotion to use on my face and neck since I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin and no matter what he used nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I use it heavily around my eyes, in the inside and outside creases, not only</li>
            <li> When I looked in the mirror a few minutes later I was beet red!</li>
            <li> the cap came loose spilling some of the cream around.</li>
            <li> I got this at Family Dollar for only $4, I was skeptical at first because I never tried this brand before</li>
            <li> I also use it on very dry areas to help nourish them.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35-years-old with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry, so usually i am careful with what i use.</li>
            <li> Little white heads popped up all around my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li> every winter my face would get little flakes around my nose and eyes and sometimes where I shave, but this stops that almost instantly.</li>
            <li> My mom has turned everyone into a Ponds lover, all the people at work, my whole family, everyone is now addicted to it.</li>
            <li> It seemed that about half of the reviews written by people with acne-prone skin were positive, the other half negative.</li>
            <li> I used a facial scrub and moisturized but just a few hours later, I was annoyed it still felt the same - dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> In the dead of winter I can often have patches of dry skin from the rough wind where this isn&#x27;t hydrating enough, but that&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin around my face, and out of desperation, I bought this jar after remembering some previous Pond&#x27;s experiences in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts forever and a little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> I cannot use other lotions because i break out, or they just dont cut it.</li>
            <li> but eventually I just couldn&#x27;t deal with how it was making my face break out in other areas.</li>
            <li> Not only in the winter, but year round!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use it due to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not pretty.  </li>
            <li> Was distraught when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stock at Target and saw an online comment about it being discontinued (unsure if that&#x27;s true in the US).</li>
            <li> little background - my skin is dry with cheeks that are prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use it at winter, my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing this cream in hopes of helping my dry skin recover this winters&#x27; harsh weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using this new moisturizer for a little over a week now and my skin is going right back to it&#x27;s disgusting dry self...    </li>
            <li> Then I turned 50, and my skin started to look really dull, despite that fact that I was using an expensive, rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Those who say it&#x27;s a bit too greasy, the trick is to leave your face wet, not just a little moist.  </li>
            <li> So I gave the jar to my younger sister who has pretty skin for her age, but not as bad as mine.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> The creams that my dermatologist recommended were either too thick or left a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> They are thick and leave a white residue.....</li>
            <li> I mean my entire face was scarlet!</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s at less than half of that price.  </li>
            <li> Half the time I never even used water, just piled it on and</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using ponds for about a year.</li>
            <li> it feels like my face is going to crack in half.</li>
            <li> My acne medication seriously dries out my skin and my daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and usually will peel off during winter</li>
            <li> It seemed like everything either broke me out or looked like a greasy mess on my face.  </li>
            <li> I live in freezing cold Michigan and have dry skin that is also prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> And since we are on a tight budget I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> found this at Wal-Mart and immediately put a little dab on my forehead (no makeup that day)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little perfumie</li>
            <li> Look like its not original brand</li>
            <li> I mean dry and flaky from chin to my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding the larger size ponds in any store</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make my skin a little shiny, but I just let it soak in for a few minutes and then blot off the shine with an oil-blotting tissue before putting the tinted moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> and it accompanies the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream very well.</li>
            <li> it was way too heavy and oily</li>
            <li> What a waste.. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> So harsh chemicals and dyes make my face break out or have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> However after a few days I started to notice that it was causing me to break out around my chin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for a really long time, but even find their products expensive and after putting on its serums and night creams, when I&#x27;d wake up, my skin would still be dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> As a kid, I had pretty bad eczema on my face.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin goes absolutely ballistic, between dry heat inside and frigid cold, dry weather outside.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount in the morning.  </li>
            <li> No reaction on my body, but I can usually use fragranced products on my body without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was cringing as I was rinsing my usual cleanser off.</li>
            <li> so I was shy about using a \\&quot;dry skin cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Especially in extreme elements such as cold wind &amp; sunburn.</li>
            <li> but dull skin with a couple of blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I decided to check amazon because you can find those things that are hard to find on amazon</li>
            <li> Well I guess I will try the cold cream next</li>
            <li> (at least 10 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a thick cream</li>
            <li> I tried ignoring it, but it just got worse and worse and my skin began to crack and flake.</li>
            <li> I apply it along with oil of olay, so the oily effect is decreased.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that at all.</li>
            <li> Not even expensive creams.</li>
            <li> one could argue it&#x27;s vaguely greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in buying the expensive stuff from department store.  </li>
            <li> I use this instead of all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, but it does not seem to work as a moisturizer as well as it does a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> it was a cold cream.</li>
            <li> I also use the Ponds cold Cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those afraid of greasiness, move along, because it is</li>
            <li> I was perusing the CVS by me and saw the ponds cold cream and this.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my face from drying out when its cold in the morning.</li>
            <li> Ponds cold cream has been around forever, but I had no idea that they made skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> People with fragrance allergies should stay away from it - too bad</li>
            <li> But in the winter, it&#x27;s flaky and painful.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be a problem for my combination skin and make my face oily, but it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> BUY IT - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> I limit my use of this face cream to the very cold winter months.</li>
            <li> So here are its flaws: it smells like an elderly woman and (at it worst)</li>
            <li> No rosacea flare-up or nasty eczema flakiness either.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for my face for years.  The 3 pack was a good value.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable, and i have been using it for years. My skin is very dry and usually will peel off during winter but this has working great for me since college!!! Will continue to buy. I hope the shipping is faster though....</li>
            <li> Great for people who tan. If my face starts to peel i just put it on, and it always works. I cannot use other lotions because i break out, or they just dont cut it. I buy the 3.9 oz and it lasts a long time. My mom has rosacea and it is the only thing that can help her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for everything for years! I have very sensitive skin and live in an incredibly dry climate and this cream is great for the money. Its so gentle and works well as a nice thick moisturizer.  I use it primarily as an everyday make up remover for my eyes, no stinging no mess.  I also use it on very dry areas to help nourish them. Nicely scented, not overwhelming.  Will be in my beauty bag forever!!</li>
            <li> excellent value. I had been purchasing larger quantities when I went out of state since in NY it cost much more. Ponds is a tried and true item that my family has used for generations. It&#x27;s also hypoallergenic which I&#x27;ve only since discovered, so I can not only use for myself, but for my grandkids who have allergies to perfume and die. The subcribe and save feature guarantees that I keep it at this grat value price and have it on hand when I need it.</li>
            <li> My mother just died at 92 and had the  complexion of a 40 year old.  She had used Pond&#x27;s for many years.  It is doing its job of keeping my skin moist and youthful.  Of course, I do recommend it highly....mixed with a measure of thanksgiving and gratitude.</li>
            <li> A great, classic skin cream.</li>
            <li> I noticed wrinkles starting to develop six or so months ago (yikes!) so I started looking for a more aggressive face cream. The Pond&#x27;s faithful convinced me to try this cream - and it&#x27;s so cheap! Why not?! I found it to be too greasy. Little white heads popped up all around my nose and on my chin. Even when I try to avoid these areas they&#x27;d appear. That and the smell. Ugh... I mean, it&#x27;s really dated smelling. I got used to it (used this cream faithfully for 2 months) but eventually I just couldn&#x27;t deal with how it was making my face break out in other areas. For the money, I can see why people love it but for me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it. ps - It didn&#x27;t do the \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; I&#x27;ve noticed in more expensive creams, either.</li>
            <li> been using this cream for over 10 years, never had a problem with it. my skin is very dry, so usually i am careful with what i use.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about 2 months and it just wasn&#x27;t creamy enough for my super dry, flaky skin. So I gave the jar to my younger sister who has pretty skin for her age, but not as bad as mine. I came home after about 2 months of her using it, and omg...... I have NEVER FELT SUCH BEAUTIFUL, SOFT, SILKY, CREAMY, SKIN!!!! ARGHHH I&#x27;m so jealous I just wish it was my skin!!! Before this, my sister had okay but dull skin with a couple of blemishes. Now her skin is glowing, smooth, ULTRA SIKLY and honestly... I just couldn&#x27;t stop touching it bc I was amazed and very very surprised it worked on her [bc it didn&#x27;t work on me].     So yeah, this product works WONDERS and MIRACLES but the catch is that it didn&#x27;t work for me. We all have different skin types and some just work better on others.</li>
            <li> This Pond&#x27;s product is great. I have been using it for 40+ years and have never found better! Not even expensive creams. But BEWARE of this 3-pack offer.  It is not 3 x 10.1 oz.  It is 2 x 10.1 oz plus 1 3.9 oz. And somehow instead of it coming thru Amazon (no shipping), it came from The New Mall with extra shipping. More expensive all-around in the end.</li>
            <li> I used to have super oily skin.  Then one day it became combination of super oily and super dry. As soon as I turned 41, my skin became super dry.  I mean dry and flaky from chin to my eye area.  My T-zone became \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.  I&#x27;ve been searching and trying different brands and types of moisturizers and creams.  I was very happy to find Clarin&#x27;s HydraQuench Rich Cream (for very dry skin or cold climates) because I didn&#x27;t have to slather layers of creams and moisturizers on my face.  All I need were an anti-aging serum, a facial lotion and Clarins&#x27;s cream.  I still had to do some touch-ups a couple of times throughout the day.  Then I discovered Pond&#x27;s The Caring classic Dry Skin Cream.  The texture is thinner than Clarin&#x27;s, but it hydrates better than the Clarin&#x27;s.  I put this cream on top of my facial lotion (IOPE Moisture Lasting by AmorePacific) in the morning.  For more than 12 hours, I don&#x27;t have to do any touch up throughout the day and don&#x27;t feel any dry or tightness around my mouth.  And No Flaking, either!  I am very impressed by this humble cream. And talk about the price difference: 1.7 oz. Clarin&#x27;s $48 and 30.3 oz. Pond&#x27;s at less than half of that price.  I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in those high price skin care products. I remember reading somewhere 90% of the cost of the product went to marketing. I don&#x27;t know how true that information was, but I find pond&#x27;s to be just as good. it moisturize yet not greasy. when my dermotologist asked me what I used and I told him, he said it was fine. nothing fancy, just a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out a good way to prevent my dry skin for a while.  It seemed like everything either broke me out or looked like a greasy mess on my face.  I&#x27;d passed Ponds up in the cosmetics aisles for years because that&#x27;s what my mother used and thought surely something new and innovative had been made since then.  It hasn&#x27;t.  Ponds is still the best, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy and makes my skin noticeably more moist.  The extra hydration has also seemed to prevent some of the breakouts I had a lot of before using it.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin my entire life but now, in the sixth month of my second pregnancy, I am experiencing very dry patches of skin on my forehead and my upper cheeks on either side of my nose. I tried ignoring it, but it just got worse and worse and my skin began to crack and flake. It was especially visible when I put on my makeup. So I began to try to not wear makeup as much, but have very pale skin and need some extra help so as not to look sickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this at Wal-Mart and immediately put a little dab on my forehead (no makeup that day): no burning, it penetrated my skin, felt silky and dewy -- but not greasy -- and I could see and feel the difference right away. My dry skin was much less visible, stopped itching and looked and felt almost normal. And it was only $4 for a big tub! It even works on my dry, chapped hands that have been ravaged from dish-washing and constant hand-sanitizer use -- and it doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;, just soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, but it does not seem to work as a moisturizer as well as it does a makeup remover. I tried Cetaphil with SPF 15, but it made my skin burn and just sat on top of my skin like an oil slick. I even tried Eucerin for severely dry skin -- no burning, and it saturated, but it was way too heavy and oily (it&#x27;s not made for faces, though). As I said, I have oily skin prone to breakout so I was shy about using a \\&quot;dry skin cream\\&quot;. And since we are on a tight budget I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This product is PERFECT for my needs and, since a little goes a long way, will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOORAY FOR PONDS!</li>
            <li> I came over here looking at the reviews and as I started reading I realized that I love this product that I have been using for some time, but I thought this whole time it was a cold cream. It seemed to be the only thing that removed the Kohl from my eyes and leave my face so clean. Half the time I never even used water, just piled it on and viola my skin was soft and glowing.   Well I guess I will try the cold cream next :) If you want a great eye makeup remover that is gentle and gets the job done, well here you have it. I roomed at a hotel with an older woman at a wedding and she loaned me hers and swore by the cold cream, so I tried it and loved it and bought what I thought was it.   I kept wondering why I really didn&#x27;t feel I needed that Olay night cream after using this product. I &lt;3 you Ponds!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion my skin seems to love, I was raised using it. I also use the Ponds cold Cream. These are both a greasy type of lotion I would recommend this for anyone with skin like mine that is ultra dry all of the time. This does have a fragrance to it, I have really sensitive skin and this does not bother it at all. My mom has turned everyone into a Ponds lover, all the people at work, my whole family, everyone is now addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and very quick service . your  produt  came hear in very good conditions. I&#x27;am will repet the nice experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ponds since I was 14 yrs. old and I&#x27;m now 58!  I attribute the fact that my face is aging gracefully (very few wrinkles and good tone) to Ponds and no tanning.  I tried other more expensive facial creams and they did not work, so I went back to Ponds.  My daughter has also been using this product since she was in her teens and she swears by it.  And this is a good deal compared to the prices at the drug stores!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I live in freezing cold Michigan and have dry skin that is also prone to break outs. In the winter, my skin goes absolutely ballistic, between dry heat inside and frigid cold, dry weather outside. I discovered Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream about a month ago, and my skin has not looked this good since my semester in Southern France! I apply it twice a day - I dab on only a tiny bit in the morning before make up (you really don&#x27;t need much), and apply a much more generous amount at night before bedtime. My skin is soft, smooth, and break out free! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always used Ponds Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, and have been using Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream since my freshman year of college. My skin was really dry during the winter time and my roomate suggested I try her Pond&#x27;s Classic Dry Skin Cream. I did, and 4 years later I am still an avid user! Not only in the winter, but year round! I use it heavily around my eyes, in the inside and outside creases, not only does it help my makeup glide on/stay on but I believe it helps fight wrinkles too! I&#x27;ve heard older women swear by this cream as the ultimate wrinkle fighter! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. And I&#x27;ve tried expensive facial creams, this one works better than them all. Also, if you buy the big jar, it will last you close to a year. Try this! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Been using this new moisturizer for a little over a week now and my skin is going right back to it&#x27;s disgusting dry self...    Previously I had been using ponds for about a year. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING :]  &lt;33 my mom got it for me and my skin never glowed before this stuff.</li>
            <li> The wife bought this on my account - I figure it must be pretty good if she goes through so much of it.</li>
            <li> After trying many other brands for my dry complexion I remembered what my Mother used and purchased Ponds brand.  Cannot believe the difference in my skin.  For a reasonable price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 4.5, only because when a product is this good you have to nitpick its flaws. So here are its flaws: it smells like an elderly woman and (at it worst) one could argue it&#x27;s vaguely greasy. The good news is that the old lady fragrance doesn&#x27;t follow you around, and if you find it greasy then just put less on or grab a towel and wipe some off.      Its a great product because it moisturizes your skin very well, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and it does actually give your skin a healthy glow - probably by keeping it moist.  Also, the price is pretty good as well for 3-10.1 oz containers.  (Just mind the shipping costs, as always.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you - cold cream is the BEST facial moisturizer and it does a great job at loosening makeup residue!  You can skip the Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background - my skin is dry with cheeks that are prone to breakouts.  This is the only product that helps the dryness.  It isn&#x27;t oily and does not clog my pores.  My face feels fresh after applying.</li>
            <li> I have never been particular with how my skin looked like.  Then time came when I&#x27;ve been getting more pimples and started having more obvious blemishes on the face.  I did not have the patience to use a combination of products.  All that I needed to do was use a generous amount of Ponds at night and massage until the cream gets absorbed, wipe off excess.  Just a small amount in the morning.  Both after washing the face with facial bar, nothing particular nor specific.  After a couple of months, skin started improving.  Not totally clear yet, but significantly improved without use of other products.  Still having a pimple once in a while, but not bad like before.    I used the Ponds cold cream back in the Philippines, and it also takes off more dirt that does not come off with just washing the face.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive this winter and Ponds has allowed me to keep it soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve tried every fancy cream and cleanser I could afford but always come back to Ponds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those afraid of greasiness, move along, because it is but, if you use it properly you won&#x27;t have an oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face and leave damp&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Ponds to damp skin and allow it to sink in &amp; seal in moisture (at least 10 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;3. Towel off any excess and do your face makeup (wonderful under primers)</li>
            <li> I love it. This is my favorite moisturizer and the price is a deal. These at the stores like Walmart and Target go for as much as 12.99 just for one.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin. This is all I use during winter. It is a bit heavier so during summer, I use the [[ASIN:B001E96NEI Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, SPF 45, 1.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] instead. Great price good value no thrills product. I don&#x27;t believe in buying the expensive stuff from department store.  I heard 99% of the cost is for advertising.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever. It can be used as a night cream, day cream and a body cream. It is very light, like a lotion. My skin love it and glow. I prefer to use it at winter, my skin is especially dry. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a general facial moisturizer and it works great, especially at night. This product is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> My skin is as dry as the Sahara desert, but also acne prone and very sensitive to chemicals. This is the only thing I have been able to find that keeps my skin from being so dry it feels like my face is going to crack in half.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this classic product that my mom used when I was a little girl.  For a brief moment I sas able to buy this, but eventually the manufacturer changed it to something else.  I was very happy to find this in Amazon and at an amazing price.  Yes, still the same classic one as I have known it. I apply this on my face after shower before going to bed and leaves my skin soft and hydrated and always get a compliment if I go to a professional dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good products never die.  Thanks and hoping you will always have this available.</li>
            <li> This is all i use and amazon can get you these at the best prices.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  I use it for face message and to reserve moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular lotions on my face forever untill I bought this. This is great for the face! It&#x27;s so much smoother and lighter then others. I have combination skin (sensitive, oily, dry) and every winter my face would get little flakes around my nose and eyes and sometimes where I shave, but this stops that almost instantly. After one day, the next morning I looked at my face and they were gone! It also lasts a long time I&#x27;ve been using it a week and I didn&#x27;t even make a dent in the jar so the price is great for what your getting. The smell is... Nice, it is but it&#x27;s a little perfumie it smells like my grandma. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal thought, it goes away in 10 minutes after applying. I would recommend it to everyone it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin around my face, and out of desperation, I bought this jar after remembering some previous Pond&#x27;s experiences in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;- No stinging or burning sensations, which is great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin feeling incredibly smooth and silky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes forever to absorb, especially if you accidentally use too much&lt;br /&gt;- The moisturizing benefit doesn&#x27;t last. After a couple of hours, I was already aware of my skin flaking off in the driest spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of cons compared to the pros, but the two were the most important points of a moisturizer. After weeks of using it, I finally gave up and moved on to another. I&#x27;ll probably keep this and use it as a night cream, where it doesn&#x27;t matter if my skin has absorbed enough it or not.</li>
            <li> I received the Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream that I bought for my mom. The box came and everything looked okay except that packing could have been a little better to prevent the product from bumping around. My mom told me that one of the bottles in the 3 pack had somehow leaked some of the cream out. I looked at the bottle and it looked like the bottle might have gotten bumped during transit and the cap came loose spilling some of the cream around. What a waste.. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product was good and buying in bulk saved some money since my mom always uses this stuff.</li>
            <li> As a kid, I had pretty bad eczema on my face. The creams that my dermatologist recommended were either too thick or left a greasy feel. My mom, who doesn&#x27;t have eczema, had been using Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream and said I should give it a try. I have been using this cream for the past 8 years and my face looks and feels great! I used to buy this cream from a local store, but just recently started buying it from Amazon because it&#x27;s a better value. Three huge jars, and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the first jar!! &#x3D;)  I bought this on Nov. 16, 2011 for $16.96 + subscribe&amp;save + prime</li>
            <li> A tried and true product that is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.  From my great grandmother on down, this cream has been the fountain of youth for my female family members for years.  It makes dry skin feel soft and supple and has a nice fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;This trio is a great bargain for a great product; I highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> If you get dry skin this works wonders on it without making you feel as if you&#x27;re ready to be roasted. It also has a pleasant but not overbearing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Every winter I whip this out and use it on my face and neck. Does a FABULOUS job of hydrating and moisturizing. If you have very dry skin this is the cream. Also its a classic that has been there from my grandmas time.</li>
            <li> I have been using POND&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream for some years now. This is the only cream that will work for me, won&#x27;t cause me to have allergic reaction or making my face even drier. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for facials and moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> Great deal! And of course I&#x27;ve always been a Pond&#x27;s fan. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only cream I can use.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing this cream in hopes of helping my dry skin recover this winters&#x27; harsh weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t use it due to the fragrance. Very strong flowery odor, and it bothered my allergies!I had to promptly wash it off. If you have any type of flower allergy pass on this one. I should have purchased an odorless skin cream, not this!</li>
            <li> It is the best...........creamy not greasy. It is reasonably priced, too. I use this instead of all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream since I was a young teen,  and recommend it to everyone with dry skin and it&#x27;s affordable too.</li>
            <li> This is probably the only cream that keeps my skin hydrated for the whole day. It&#x27;s an oily product, so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying it during the day. I apply it along with oil of olay, so the oily effect is decreased.</li>
            <li> It a large jar, and it is excellent for aging, drying skin.  And.,..I can get it delivered to my door!</li>
            <li> I love Ponds and am happy with the delivery and the product. will more than likely order it again. I have used this product for years and was having problems finding it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Europe, I once bought this POND&#x27;S Dry Skin Cream for my wife from the USA, since then she only uses this cream, I again ordered six POND&#x27;S Dry Skin Cream, 10.1-oz..&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream for years and continue to like it.  I put some on my lips at night before going to bed, I often use it on my fingernails at night.  Sometimes use it on my shins if they seem dry.  It is mild, greasier and longer-lasting than a lotion but not nearly as greasy as Vaseline would be--in short, is just right in my opinion.  It has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> In a dry climate, even people with oily skin need to use rich moisturizers, as otherwise the dryness dries the surface of the skin, trapping oils and making the skin break out. That used to happen to me badly, until someone advised me to switch to rich cream moisturizers - and my skin cleared up and started looking beautiful. Then I turned 50, and my skin started to look really dull, despite that fact that I was using an expensive, rich moisturizer. So I looked around for something new, and was surprised to find this inexpensive Ponds Dry Skin Cream listed on a beauty website alongside far more expensive creams as being a top moisturizer. I grew up with Ponds Cleansing Cream in the house, which my mother used, and thought this moisturizer looked really old-fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like to save money, so decided to try it - and am flat-out amazed at how good it is. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-4 months now, and my skin is transformed: dewy, radiant, lush, smooth, plump and velvety soft. I absolutely love how my skin looks and feels, and now use makeup only very lightly (mostly tinted moisturizer with SPF, and a little powder blush and light bronzing powder), or not at all on casual days, because my skin looks so good I don&#x27;t want to cover it up. At most I just need a little sun protection and hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin a little shiny, but I just let it soak in for a few minutes and then blot off the shine with an oil-blotting tissue before putting the tinted moisturizer on. I blot again, then color and contour with the powders. When I&#x27;m done, my skin looks amazing, and stays that way all day - and I get great compliments, too. And at night I love to layer it on and massage it as it soaks in, it feels so good and I wake up looking so dewy. I also use it all over my neck and upper chest, and they are fabulously soft and smooth, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might not like the powdery, flowery fragrance, but I like it, reminds me of my grandmother. I&#x27;m also afan of Dove Pink Bar for the same reason. People with fragrance allergies should stay away from it - too bad they don&#x27;t make an unscented version! And some might not like that it has mineral oil, but others think the bad rap about mineral oil is a myth, and regard mineral oil as one of the best things for your skin. I have to say I&#x27;m in the latter camp, as I honestly have never had a moisturizer this effective. I swear by it, and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream of all time!  I have been using it for years, and even if I diverge and try something else, I always come back to this one.  This is my &#x27;every day&#x27; moisturizer, it goes on smooth, feels soft on my skin and has a nice, delicate scent.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> *I can&#x27;t help it.  I love Ponds.  I wish it did not have parabens, but the other creams I have tried that do not are just not the same.  They are thick and leave a white residue.....so I&#x27;m back to Ponds.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping to love this! But it didn&#x27;t work for my acne-prone, sensitive, eczema-prone skin. My face actually had a mild reaction to it within about two minutes...I honestly think the reaction was from the fragrance (very strong!). No reaction on my body, but I can usually use fragranced products on my body without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you have very reactive facial skin, you might need to stick with fragrance-free products. It has some nice ingredients in it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Large package, good value for money. Just the right cream for dry skin. Recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream. It truly is silky and so smooth. I can put it on right after showering and it&#x27;s perfect to moisturize. Everyone I&#x27;ve recommended it to loves it, and we all have a range of quite dry to oily skin. It&#x27;s not heavy, not slimy, not sticky; there&#x27;s no weird residue, it&#x27;s perfect. Lotion always has some scent but this one&#x27;s very neutral and goes away pretty quickly. Also, this stuff lasts for ages (years). I simply ADORE Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream, and strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5, no question.</li>
            <li> Great face cream for harsh winter weather and it accompanies the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream very well. The skin looks exceptionally smooth!  Other times, this face cream can be quite greasy and it breaks me out if I use too much. I limit my use of this face cream to the very cold winter months. That&#x27;s when I get the best results. It is way too rich to use during the spring and summer months. I would look really greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products over the years, but I&#x27;d always go back to Clinique.  When I turned 40 a couple of years ago, I started getting red blotchy patches of super dry flaky skin.  After seeing my derm I was diagnosed with rosacea, and eczema. Lucky me.  Clinique was too strong for me.  I tried prescription stuff from the derm, but it just made my face greasy and red.  Not pretty.  I was perusing the CVS by me and saw the ponds cold cream and this.  That night, I started using both.  I will never use anything else on my face.  Yes it has an old lady fragrance, but you know what...it works!  No rosacea flare-up or nasty eczema flakiness either.  Somehow, it cleans the gunk out of my pores and did something with my fine lines around my eyes.  Don&#x27;t know how, don&#x27;t care why.  It works and you should try it!!</li>
            <li> Expensive skin creams move over - who needs them when you can get such a great cream for such a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. My face is always peeling. This lotion fixed my dry skin problem. I use it once in the morning and it keeps my face from peeling the entire day!</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pond&#x27;s my whole life, as did my mother and grandmother before me.  Both had/have beautiful skin and I hope to follow in their footsteps.  Ponds is a rich cream without being greasy and I&#x27;ve yet to find another product that works as well.  I switched to all cruelty-free beauty and homecare products but this is my one hold out, the one product I can&#x27;t live without.  I hope unilever starts to move in the direction of cruelty-free research but I have to admit, I love my Ponds!</li>
            <li> Ponds didn&#x27;t work wonders on my skin as soon as my skin hit the air it was dry all over again. Will not buy again. I guess I will be going back to cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Been using for years and will continue to do so. Was distraught when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stock at Target and saw an online comment about it being discontinued (unsure if that&#x27;s true in the US).</li>
            <li> I love this product. I did a review for it on YouTube, but this is def one of my GO TO holy grail skincare products. I would highly recommend this for dry skin. Especially in extreme elements such as cold wind &amp; sunburn. It&#x27;s good to always hydrate your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PvlaJz9vndU</li>
            <li> I got this at Family Dollar for only $4, I was skeptical at first because I never tried this brand before so I decided to give it a shot,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the best decision I have ever made. I had dry skin, especially during colder seasons. This made my face so soft and dewy and made a great face primer for makeup as well! Definitely definitely DEFINITELY recommend this. Once it is all gone, I&#x27;ll buy another. Love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Great product, great buy, great delivery</li>
            <li> This is my one and only skincare cream..for face, and whole body...nothing comes close to the effectiveness and results of a dry skin transforming to smooth one. A staple and I do buy this in bulk as I use this for whole body as a body cream.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product. It seemed that about half of the reviews written by people with acne-prone skin were positive, the other half negative. So I decided to give this a try. My acne medication seriously dries out my skin and my daily moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t enough. I figured that if the Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream caused my face to break out, I would just return it. No harm done. Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I put it on sparingly after washing my face. It stung, but my skin is so dry that really any liquid stings. So I didn&#x27;t think too much of it. After a few minutes it actually started to feel really nice. Greasy, but smooth. I went to bed and everything seemed great. When I washed my face this morning my skin burned all over. I was cringing as I was rinsing my usual cleanser off. When I looked in the mirror a few minutes later I was beet red! I mean my entire face was scarlet! My friends in class were actually asking if I was sunburnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but my face ached and stung all day today. The skin was hot to the touch. The only thing that helped was putting aloe on the burned areas. I definitely will not be using again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and no strong odor to contend with.</li>
            <li> Look like its not original brand</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite facial moisturizer out of everything I&#x27;ve used. It applies really smoothly and leaves your skin feeling very dewy and soft, not greasy whatsoever. I use it under very light makeup and people are always asking me how I get my skin to look so dewy. I have naturally very oily skin, so I was wary about applying something that would make my face even more oily looking. However, this cream doesn&#x27;t accentuate my oily skin, it just makes it look glowing :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this at night before bed. It keeps my face from drying out when its cold in the morning. It&#x27;s so good that my boyfriend (who also has really oily skin) swears by it as well. He uses it after shaving and says everyone pays him compliments about how it smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the third generation to use Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream. Since it is a bit more costly, I&#x27;ve tried many other face moisturizers: name brand, organic, recommended by others, ceraphil.., ect. but I ALWAYS come back to using good old Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As we move into fall I dug out this skin cream to address some of the dry patches that are beginning to appear around my nose and eyebrows.  I real want to love it.  I do.  But every time I use this product I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing grease onto my face, although that feeling goes away after a few minutes when the moisturizer is absorbed by the skin.  It does do a fantastic job of treating my dry areas, but I have also begun to break out recently and I think this product may be contributing to that.  I will finish what&#x27;s left in the container, but it&#x27;s up in the air as far as to whether or not i will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought this skin cream for my mom.She love it.&lt;br /&gt;I could purchase it in CVS, but Amazon price was better</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin all year long. But in the winter, it&#x27;s flaky and painful. I have really sensitive skin, especially on my face. So harsh chemicals and dyes make my face break out or have an allergic reaction. But this stuff is great. I started using my moms, but I had to get my own because I loved it so much. It&#x27;s creamy and it&#x27;s so moisturizing. It&#x27;s definitely helped out with all my blemishes and evening out my skin tone, since I have some redness.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a bit overwhelming sometimes. It smells like baby lotion, which is fine. But I personally don&#x27;t want people near my face thinking \\&quot;Is she wearing baby lotion?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This stuff is so highly fragranced that my allergies went through the roof with the eyes watering and dark circles. Wish they made it in fragrance free.</li>
            <li> the best, most affordable skin cream</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding the larger size ponds in any store and I decided to check amazon because you can find those things that are hard to find on amazon and I was able to get not only the larger size but 3 of them for a very reasonable price , thank you .............I have been using ponds for over 20 years and will use no other ,it is not the most expensive but it work and I love it thanks amazon for this product..</li>
            <li> Love it this is all I buy, and cant buy enough. When people come to the house they use it all the time</li>
            <li> Great night time mosturizer. Very soft and feels good when applied. I would highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and normally have combination skin.  I noticed just last night that I had a rough patch near my chin and on the sides of my mouth.  I used a facial scrub and moisturized but just a few hours later, I was annoyed it still felt the same - dry and rough.  We&#x27;re in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy here in New Jersey and I&#x27;ve been pouring out money on food and other incidentals daily since there&#x27;s no electric so I couldn&#x27;t hit a department store for something fancy but I couldn&#x27;t stand the dry patch so I headed over to the one open supermarket and fortunately there was old faithful - Pond&#x27;s.  I bought a tub of cream and came right home and used a little facial scrub and then slathered it on while my face was still moist.  Only hours later, my skin feels dewy and fresh. Those who say it&#x27;s a bit too greasy, the trick is to leave your face wet, not just a little moist.  As soon as I rinse my face I just massaged in the cream and just minutes later I had a fresh and dewy complexion without the shine that mineral oil can leave behind.  Don&#x27;t forget your neck (all the way around) and chest.  It&#x27;s really a treat. Put the humidifier on at night and it&#x27;s over - wake up to skin that&#x27;s ultra soft and glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help but wonder what is it that makes we women rush out to buy the latest and greatest - when half the products that came out only a few years ago don&#x27;t even exist anymore.  They&#x27;ve either been \\&quot;reformulated\\&quot; or discontinued, which should tell us something.  Pond&#x27;s products don&#x27;t change and mature women who&#x27;ve used them for years swear by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful that something so good and inexpensive does just what it says it does.  As my skincare needs have changed and I&#x27;ve come to need a more moisturizing \\&quot;official\\&quot; night cream, Pond&#x27;s will be it.  Inexpensive, smells good, works and that&#x27;s that.  What more do we need really?</li>
            <li> I got them from BJ before and my mother-in-law loved it very much. Nothing to complain about this product.&lt;br /&gt;But I do want to complain about the shipping holding period of the subscribe &amp; Save order - what is the point to keep subscribe &amp; Save orders on hold for more than one month but ship regular orders right away? My understand is that amazon is discouraging subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I am impressed! I was afraid it would be a problem for my combination skin and make my face oily, but it didn&#x27;t! And just a bit of it does the job. It felt so good on my face that I decided to use it all over after a shower...it left my skin feeling smooth and silky with a light fresh scent. I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants beautifully hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for years and love it. The only problem was that when they arrived one jar was open and the cream was all over the box.</li>
            <li> Ponds cold cream has been around forever, but I had no idea that they made skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and have tried everything, so I decided to try this.  I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick cream so it doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage.  It blends in quickly and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell, but to me is not bad and I am very sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 3 pack and that has worked out well for me as I am not only using it on my face but&lt;br /&gt;also on my hands.  Both are feeling much softer and looking better.</li>
            <li> my wife is 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream</li>
            <li> great price on Ponds Skin Moisturizer . My wife goes through this stuff like nothing else. She gets really cranky when she runs out of it. Says it keeps her dry skin moist. The dog goes nuts to lick it off of her. This was bought when you only had to have a $25 purchase to get free shipping. Now that is $35 I have to accumulate a larger need list before I buy. Not happy about that at all. Now that amazon is collecting sales tax I won&#x27;t be buying as much from them.</li>
            <li> This is one of my holy Grail products! I have very troublesome skin so when I find soemthing that works, I&#x27;m thrilled and stick with it. I have combo skin that likes to act up, and over the years have dealt with problematic cystic acne. I use this religiously at night. I don&#x27;t feel like it clogs my pores, ever causing potential acne issues. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the dead of winter I can often have patches of dry skin from the rough wind where this isn&#x27;t hydrating enough, but that&#x27;s really my only complaint. If I feel super dry during the day, I&#x27;ve used this in small doses; I feel it&#x27;s a nice extra dose of hydration in a day situation where I know it won&#x27;t make my skin go crazy and produce a ton of oil. I also can work a little makeup on top of it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It lasts forever and a little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by a friend and I am so glad I tired it. Best face cream I have ever used. It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy/</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she says that it has done her very well to her skin, and the price is very reasonable compared to some other creams, she is very happy.</li>
            <li> This is my night and no make up moisturizer. For me, there is nothing better. My face is nourished, soft, smooth and oh so happy. My mom used this product back 50 years ago and I am just happy using it. I luv Ponds!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35-years-old with very dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried every drug store brand imaginable and can&#x27;t justify spending oodles of money on a 1 oz jar of something from a department store. I&#x27;ve used Olay for a really long time, but even find their products expensive and after putting on its serums and night creams, when I&#x27;d wake up, my skin would still be dry in the morning. I finally decided to try Ponds based on reviews I had read. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now...SAME jar!...and I love it. It keeps my skin moist and I don&#x27;t seem to notice my fine lines as much as I used to. Ponds also makes a wrinkle cream, and I like that too but it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as this product. It seems that the face and body cream are the same if you compare the ingredients and I use both. I can&#x27;t wash my face without it. I just need to remember to put it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice both for fragrance and for functionality</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizing lotion to use on my face and neck since I have dry skin.  I decided to try Ponds after hearing good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it arrived I opened it and checked it out, it smelled awesome!  I started to use it right away and liked it.  However after a few days I started to notice that it was causing me to break out around my chin.  I stopped using it and the breakouts went away.  So for me it wasn&#x27;t the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using it as a foot lotion, since it does provide a lot of moisture I will not be buying it again though.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin and no matter what he used nothing seemed to work. I bought this at target several months ago and his problem has gone away!&lt;br /&gt;Now I found this pack in amazon and I got it for him. It is cheaper and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;He has sensitive skin too, but this cream didn&#x27;t give him any rashes.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really help moisturize my dry skin. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have used Pond&#x27;s since I was a teenager. Because my mother told me to.&lt;br /&gt;Pond&#x27;s blue top at night and Oil of Olay with spf every morning.  Wash your face with baby soap before bed and when you wake up. If you don&#x27;t want to be carded buying cigarettes at 30 years old then don&#x27;t use Pond&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m 48 and people think I&#x27;m 30 something.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial cream. This one is the only one that protects my dry skin well. The smell is also good!</li>
            <li> I am simply amazed by this lotion. I am very prone to acne breakouts, so I was really worried about ordering this product at the posted price and potentially wasting the money along with three jars of product. I am so glad I took the chance! This lotion feels so good and velvety going on. My powdered makeup looks so much more natural over this lotion than the lotions I had tried before. My skin tends to flake (yes, despite the acne, go figure!), and this has reduced the flaking by probably 70% - a huge improvement. It seems to moisturize my face all day long! The best part: my acne has reduced immensely - like 80%, at least! So much so that I have wondered whether its the lotion, or have passed through an acne stage. But given how my skin feels with this lotion, I really think its the lotion. Also, the oily build up has reduced, so blackheads have also reduced, making my pores appear smaller. I just can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion. BUY IT - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  Oh, one more thing: a little goes a long way, so three jars are going to last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;! So if you can find somewhere to buy one jar at a time, I recommend you do that. Even though it feels so good that you will want to put it on your neck. And your arms. And your hands. And...well, you get the point! :-)  Update: The 3 jars lasted more than four years, I&#x27;m finally back to reorder!</li>
