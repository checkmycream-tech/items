            <li>Great Product ..</li>
            <li>volumizing root boost conditioner worked great.</li>
            <li>This is however, a very nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t seem to linger after you have used it.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner\\&quot; works well and has pleasant, but not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li>but it is pleasant.</li>
            <li>you want a good product that can do the job without breaking the bank then give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I use this conditioner with the shampoo, and they seem to make a good match.</li>
            <li>no results with this product.. use the products you know work.. not because its a good buy</li>
            <li>you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 4, because I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it,</li>
            <li>It smells great, comes out nicely, and leaves my hair with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had many complements on how good my hair looks and how good it smells.</li>
            <li>The scent was also just okay, nothing remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Tangles comb out nicely.</li>
            <li>This was a lovely change: lightweight volume, No frizzled, and my hair straightened happily.  :)</li>
            <li>A light honeysuckle or rose would be pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Of all of the Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I&#x27;ve liked the best.</li>
            <li>Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is the very best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I was also hoping that it would be good for my scalp, but I didn&#x27;t notice that to be true</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this fine product!</li>
            <li>Cleaned my hair and my hair looked healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li>It had volumized my hair and keeps it healthy too.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have never found a better volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and the silkieness of the product without having to use a ton of it at one time.  </li>
            <li>I surely was.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses a bit more for her curls and finds they are a lot more</li>
            <li>Additionally, the scent lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the feel of it, and hope that it&#x27;s actually doing its job to nourish the hair from the root.</li>
            <li>This has made my hair more manageable and is cheaper than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is probably better for thicker or drier hair types.</li>
            <li>I thought this conditioner works just ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises, and really does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t tried many, I have never found a root booster or volume product that does work on my hair.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
            <li>Like most of their products, the scent is medicinal, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for that with performance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it was very good at conditioning at all in general.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used this shampoo/conditioner combo i loved it.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy again until they make a light scent, or better yet, an unscented form.  </li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp volumizing conditioner has helped add a great amount of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>It is so effective that I am using conditioner more than once a week for the first time</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, if cheap smelling.</li>
            <li>This Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy is a very nice.</li>
            <li>However, I wish it came in a more friendly container.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner rinses out more quickly and like the dandruff shampoo leaves my fine curly hair with more volume.</li>
            <li>Mine tends to split easily</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and rinses out just fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos my closet is full of duds that didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Volumizing Root Boost is average at best.</li>
            <li>hands down BEST smelling conditioner i have used in my life</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, but lots of it, that tends to get flat easy and Its always been shiny and beautiful and I don&#x27;t like to have to use a lot of product that can damage my hair.</li>
            <li>It works fine, it smells fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t count the number of conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried and then thrown in the trash in an effort to give my fine hair some needed volume.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a boost in volume after using it a while (and I have had fine hair all my life).</li>
            <li>I have a lot of strands---but the strand texture is fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels wonderful and even a little softer than it has before.</li>
            <li>(Huge points to the bottle design</li>
            <li>But I do enjoy that aspect of it.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it add volume to my hair, but it smells great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li>Their products are amazing and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it fair to compare Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy</li>
            <li>It is like it just sits on top of it and then rinses right off.</li>
            <li>The conditioning is exceptional as far as getting rid of tangles.  </li>
            <li>Makes it super easy to comb out tangles.  </li>
            <li>This produce has a great smell; it&#x27;s clean, light and seems to stay for a long time!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains vitamins and healthy natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>As a woman who now has to color treat her hair, hot water is the devil to my hair as it diminishes the color more quickly.</li>
            <li>I only use it on weekends to get a good clean.</li>
            <li>It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.ioner from time to time for fuller styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.</li>
            <li>So yes, a good impression overall.</li>
            <li>(2) makes my hair feel soft and bouncy all day, and (3) gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>However, the hair gets nice and soft, just what a conditioner is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling</li>
            <li>though discounts are pretty easy to find).  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you get to use the most conditioner possible out of the container</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for in a conditioner; it conditions my hair and leaves it shiny smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case), so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner is light and, while not as noticeably as the shampoo, does achieve good volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>Hardly any scent (which is very good!) rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and sheeny after blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair needed some extra TLC after a summer of swimming in lakes and traveling and this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>conditioner seems like it isn&#x27;t absorbed by the hair at all.</li>
            <li>Although I won&#x27;t say the quality of Clear conditioner is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is worth the money</li>
            <li>Even slathering it on the roots and rinsing well, it feels incredible CLEAN and SOFT when my hair is dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mostly Recommended (you might have to try it to see if it is right for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use heat tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers; my stylist says my hair is in very good shape.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash, I noticed my hair had more tangles and after a few more days I noticed that my ends felt dryer.  </li>
            <li>Some product lines make members of my household sneeze, but CLEAR was fine for all of them.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I did not get any unsolicited compliments like I did with the other conditioners.</li>
            <li>When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoos, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!</li>
            <li>I always leave my conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes so as to soak up any extra umph that the product might be able to deliver</li>
            <li>In short, I don&#x27;t feel compelled to buy more</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li>Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I found that it brought life back to my hair and made my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>well, I&#x27;m glad he likes it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than a few products, and most don&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick</li>
            <li>I rely on my shampoo and conditioner and my hair dryer and round brush to make it look good...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My husband, on the other hand, tried it and liked it</li>
            <li>I used this product several times along with the dry scalp shampoo by the same company and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Also, like the shampoo, it has a very strong perfume, which is another reason to use them together, as I think the fragrance would clash with other products.</li>
            <li>side dispensing means you can easily dispense even the last of the product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this conditioner worked just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li>I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure shampoo and conditioners are much, much easier to hold.</li>
            <li>It does rinse easily with no apparent residue, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really would rather add the fragrance myself.  </li>
            <li>even then it just did not seem to be doing much.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this conditioner and given the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That very conditioned feeling might not suit everyone.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very oily looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>Intense Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They said this was unusual...</li>
            <li>I really like both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy and I have not found that it&#x27;s building up after daily use.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and some conditioners weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t really get any more volume using this conditioner than with any other brand conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair and my roots were not noticeably boosted.</li>
            <li>conditioner for me has to work well at detangling and moisturizing, but more emphasis on the detangling due to my hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding, but it performed on a par with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team</li>
            <li>Not very thick, but pretty wavy.</li>
            <li>Not only do I have VERY fine hair, but my hair is falling out because of a recent surgery.</li>
            <li>They have a mix of conventional and healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>When rinsing it out of my hair, it washes clean easily, and leaves my hair slick and easy to comb through when wet.  </li>
            <li>It has nice fragrance, conditions my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li>anything that weighs my hair down makes it look even more sparse.</li>
            <li>It has the same nice clean smell that the rest of the Clear line has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight volumizing, but my hair is also about 8 inches below my shoulders, so is heavy to begin with, it might work better that way for shorter hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and limp.</li>
            <li>Interestingly enough, I notice that my hair dries quickly with this line of hair products, I don&#x27;t know what causes that.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the container.</li>
            <li>particular product is a Volumizing Root Boost.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the Root Boost not only conditions well, leaving my hair soft and manageable, but it also seems to actually \\&quot;volumize\\&quot; the roots and hair shaft, making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>This one seems more conditioning then some of the other Clear conditioners.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re used to getting their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean but those shampoos dry the hair out.</li>
            <li>This bottle went missing -- found it in my pre-teens bathroom , another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>She normally uses Dove but said if this were on sale she would purchase it.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and all, but I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;volumizing root boosting\\&quot; effects after using for at least a week.</li>
            <li>Like the other \\&quot;CLEAR\\&quot; brand conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent.</li>
            <li>and then I will switch to a drugstore brand, just to try something new though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  </li>
            <li>have medium to fine layered shoulder length hair &amp; find that this product (1) does not weigh my hair down,</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recommend Clear Scalp and Beauty.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent, and this conditioner definitely helps get a comb through my wet hair after the shower, which is really the main reason I use conditioner, as I&#x27;ve always kept my hair long.</li>
            <li>I should note that I do not have fine or limp hair.</li>
            <li>Clear has become my go to shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>For me, this version of Clear did not work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level.</li>
            <li>This CLEAR \\&quot;SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing</li>
            <li>The we use the conditioner in conjunction with CLEAR shampoo and it does add volume to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like Clear conditioners.</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Volumizing</li>
            <li>However I was up for a change and thought I could swap the Clear Scalp line for the L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>Of all the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products I&#x27;ve used, Volumizing Root Boost is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally has no volume and</li>
            <li>I get a wonderfully soft texture to my hair with tons of volumne.  </li>
            <li>I think you just might be surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you want to smell an old man&#x27;s overpowering after-shave, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really surprised me.</li>
            <li>but then again, he has much shorter and thereby younger hair than I</li>
            <li>if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that the new products had a much thinner consistency than my usual shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It is not too heavy and not greasy, leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce.</li>
            <li>This whole line of hair care seems to be adequate but not exceptional.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is on the thick side, but it&#x27;s easy to work it into my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in this conditioner, and the other Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried seem to really lock in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several items in the CLEAR line</li>
            <li>read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li>It does what a conditioner should for my hair, but the odor is too much to take in an empty stomach in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This product truly leaves hair silky, soft and it does seem to give EXTRA volume as promised!</li>
            <li>My hair is also falling out like crazy and Im pregnant and its dull and much thinner than normal when it should look even better...</li>
            <li>Typically, I&#x27;m a Joico (Kpak) girl, and I default to Herbal Essences or sometimes Pantene (both have long hair products) when I cant find Joico on sale (full price Joico is not in the student budget...</li>
            <li>Especially with my hair being so long, I need something that actually works, so that I am not using a whole bottle at a time.</li>
            <li>Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Daily Conditioner with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear conditioner is comparable with some of the conditioners mentioned above.</li>
            <li>This Clear conditioner is very thick and rich, but it just didn&#x27;t perform well for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>and there is less waste than with other conditioners that have top spouts or openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hand strength needed to squeeze the container is just as incredibly bad as the product is good.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> all shampoos guarantee they are the best thing for your hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For winter it&#x27;s ideal.</li>
            <li> Good luck on getting it out of the container!  </li>

            <li> Great Product ..</li>
            <li> volumizing root boost conditioner worked great.</li>
            <li> This is however, a very nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t seem to linger after you have used it.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner\\&quot; works well and has pleasant, but not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li> but it is pleasant.</li>
            <li> you want a good product that can do the job without breaking the bank then give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I use this conditioner with the shampoo, and they seem to make a good match.</li>
            <li> no results with this product.. use the products you know work.. not because its a good buy</li>
            <li> you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4, because I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it,</li>
            <li> It smells great, comes out nicely, and leaves my hair with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had many complements on how good my hair looks and how good it smells.</li>
            <li> The scent was also just okay, nothing remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Tangles comb out nicely.</li>
            <li> This was a lovely change: lightweight volume, No frizzled, and my hair straightened happily.  :)</li>
            <li> A light honeysuckle or rose would be pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Of all of the Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I&#x27;ve liked the best.</li>
            <li> Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is the very best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I was also hoping that it would be good for my scalp, but I didn&#x27;t notice that to be true</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this fine product!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my hair and my hair looked healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> It had volumized my hair and keeps it healthy too.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the silkieness of the product without having to use a ton of it at one time.  </li>
            <li> I surely was.</li>
            <li> It does smell good though, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It does smell good though, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses a bit more for her curls and finds they are a lot more</li>
            <li> Additionally, the scent lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the feel of it, and hope that it&#x27;s actually doing its job to nourish the hair from the root.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair more manageable and is cheaper than any of the others.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is probably better for thicker or drier hair types.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner works just ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises, and really does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried many, I have never found a root booster or volume product that does work on my hair.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
            <li> Like most of their products, the scent is medicinal, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for that with performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it was very good at conditioning at all in general.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used this shampoo/conditioner combo i loved it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy again until they make a light scent, or better yet, an unscented form.  </li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp volumizing conditioner has helped add a great amount of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is so effective that I am using conditioner more than once a week for the first time</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, if cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> This Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy is a very nice.</li>
            <li> However, I wish it came in a more friendly container.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner rinses out more quickly and like the dandruff shampoo leaves my fine curly hair with more volume.</li>
            <li> Mine tends to split easily</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and rinses out just fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos my closet is full of duds that didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Volumizing Root Boost is average at best.</li>
            <li> hands down BEST smelling conditioner i have used in my life</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair, but lots of it, that tends to get flat easy and Its always been shiny and beautiful and I don&#x27;t like to have to use a lot of product that can damage my hair.</li>
            <li> It works fine, it smells fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count the number of conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried and then thrown in the trash in an effort to give my fine hair some needed volume.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a boost in volume after using it a while (and I have had fine hair all my life).</li>
            <li> I have a lot of strands---but the strand texture is fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderful and even a little softer than it has before.</li>
            <li> (Huge points to the bottle design</li>
            <li> But I do enjoy that aspect of it.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it add volume to my hair, but it smells great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li> Their products are amazing and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it fair to compare Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy</li>
            <li> It is like it just sits on top of it and then rinses right off.</li>
            <li> The conditioning is exceptional as far as getting rid of tangles.  </li>
            <li> Makes it super easy to comb out tangles.  </li>
            <li> This produce has a great smell; it&#x27;s clean, light and seems to stay for a long time!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains vitamins and healthy natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> As a woman who now has to color treat her hair, hot water is the devil to my hair as it diminishes the color more quickly.</li>
            <li> I only use it on weekends to get a good clean.</li>
            <li> It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.ioner from time to time for fuller styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.</li>
            <li> So yes, a good impression overall.</li>
            <li> (2) makes my hair feel soft and bouncy all day, and (3) gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> However, the hair gets nice and soft, just what a conditioner is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling</li>
            <li> though discounts are pretty easy to find).  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you get to use the most conditioner possible out of the container</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for in a conditioner; it conditions my hair and leaves it shiny smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case), so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner is light and, while not as noticeably as the shampoo, does achieve good volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Hardly any scent (which is very good!) rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and sheeny after blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair needed some extra TLC after a summer of swimming in lakes and traveling and this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> conditioner seems like it isn&#x27;t absorbed by the hair at all.</li>
            <li> Although I won&#x27;t say the quality of Clear conditioner is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is worth the money</li>
            <li> Even slathering it on the roots and rinsing well, it feels incredible CLEAN and SOFT when my hair is dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mostly Recommended (you might have to try it to see if it is right for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use heat tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers; my stylist says my hair is in very good shape.  </li>
            <li> After the first wash, I noticed my hair had more tangles and after a few more days I noticed that my ends felt dryer.  </li>
            <li> Some product lines make members of my household sneeze, but CLEAR was fine for all of them.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I did not get any unsolicited compliments like I did with the other conditioners.</li>
            <li> When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoos, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!</li>
            <li> I always leave my conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes so as to soak up any extra umph that the product might be able to deliver</li>
            <li> In short, I don&#x27;t feel compelled to buy more</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li> Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I found that it brought life back to my hair and made my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> well, I&#x27;m glad he likes it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than a few products, and most don&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick</li>
            <li> I rely on my shampoo and conditioner and my hair dryer and round brush to make it look good...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My husband, on the other hand, tried it and liked it</li>
            <li> I used this product several times along with the dry scalp shampoo by the same company and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Also, like the shampoo, it has a very strong perfume, which is another reason to use them together, as I think the fragrance would clash with other products.</li>
            <li> side dispensing means you can easily dispense even the last of the product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this conditioner worked just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure shampoo and conditioners are much, much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> It does rinse easily with no apparent residue, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really would rather add the fragrance myself.  </li>
            <li> even then it just did not seem to be doing much.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this conditioner and given the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That very conditioned feeling might not suit everyone.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very oily looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> Intense Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said this was unusual...</li>
            <li> I really like both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy and I have not found that it&#x27;s building up after daily use.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and some conditioners weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t really get any more volume using this conditioner than with any other brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair and my roots were not noticeably boosted.</li>
            <li> conditioner for me has to work well at detangling and moisturizing, but more emphasis on the detangling due to my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Nothing outstanding, but it performed on a par with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team</li>
            <li> Not very thick, but pretty wavy.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have VERY fine hair, but my hair is falling out because of a recent surgery.</li>
            <li> They have a mix of conventional and healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> When rinsing it out of my hair, it washes clean easily, and leaves my hair slick and easy to comb through when wet.  </li>
            <li> It has nice fragrance, conditions my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li> anything that weighs my hair down makes it look even more sparse.</li>
            <li> It has the same nice clean smell that the rest of the Clear line has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight volumizing, but my hair is also about 8 inches below my shoulders, so is heavy to begin with, it might work better that way for shorter hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and limp.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, I notice that my hair dries quickly with this line of hair products, I don&#x27;t know what causes that.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the container.</li>
            <li> particular product is a Volumizing Root Boost.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the Root Boost not only conditions well, leaving my hair soft and manageable, but it also seems to actually \\&quot;volumize\\&quot; the roots and hair shaft, making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> This one seems more conditioning then some of the other Clear conditioners.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re used to getting their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean but those shampoos dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> This bottle went missing -- found it in my pre-teens bathroom , another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> She normally uses Dove but said if this were on sale she would purchase it.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and all, but I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;volumizing root boosting\\&quot; effects after using for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Like the other \\&quot;CLEAR\\&quot; brand conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent.</li>
            <li> and then I will switch to a drugstore brand, just to try something new though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  </li>
            <li> have medium to fine layered shoulder length hair &amp; find that this product (1) does not weigh my hair down,</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recommend Clear Scalp and Beauty.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent, and this conditioner definitely helps get a comb through my wet hair after the shower, which is really the main reason I use conditioner, as I&#x27;ve always kept my hair long.</li>
            <li> I should note that I do not have fine or limp hair.</li>
            <li> Clear has become my go to shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> For me, this version of Clear did not work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level.</li>
            <li> This CLEAR \\&quot;SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing</li>
            <li> The we use the conditioner in conjunction with CLEAR shampoo and it does add volume to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Clear conditioners.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Volumizing</li>
            <li> However I was up for a change and thought I could swap the Clear Scalp line for the L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> Of all the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products I&#x27;ve used, Volumizing Root Boost is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally has no volume and</li>
            <li> I get a wonderfully soft texture to my hair with tons of volumne.  </li>
            <li> I think you just might be surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you want to smell an old man&#x27;s overpowering after-shave, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really surprised me.</li>
            <li> but then again, he has much shorter and thereby younger hair than I</li>
            <li> if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that the new products had a much thinner consistency than my usual shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and not greasy, leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> This whole line of hair care seems to be adequate but not exceptional.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is on the thick side, but it&#x27;s easy to work it into my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients in this conditioner, and the other Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried seem to really lock in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several items in the CLEAR line</li>
            <li> read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li> It does what a conditioner should for my hair, but the odor is too much to take in an empty stomach in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This product truly leaves hair silky, soft and it does seem to give EXTRA volume as promised!</li>
            <li> My hair is also falling out like crazy and Im pregnant and its dull and much thinner than normal when it should look even better...</li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;m a Joico (Kpak) girl, and I default to Herbal Essences or sometimes Pantene (both have long hair products) when I cant find Joico on sale (full price Joico is not in the student budget...</li>
            <li> Especially with my hair being so long, I need something that actually works, so that I am not using a whole bottle at a time.</li>
            <li> Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Daily Conditioner with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear conditioner is comparable with some of the conditioners mentioned above.</li>
            <li> This Clear conditioner is very thick and rich, but it just didn&#x27;t perform well for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> and there is less waste than with other conditioners that have top spouts or openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hand strength needed to squeeze the container is just as incredibly bad as the product is good.</li>
            <li> The bottle seeps a bit when it is left upside down in my shower and it is about 3 times more expensive than my regular less expensive conditioners that quite frankly do just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my old stand-by (Suave professionals conditioner) does the same thing, so, in the end, my choice of conditioner would come down to price point since performance seems to be equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> My hair is not overly dry, so it shouldn&#x27;t have been such a big issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is not overly dry, so it shouldn&#x27;t have been such a big issue.</li>
            <li> Although I thought it&#x27;s a smart idea to place the dispenser at the bottom, I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it&#x27;s easier to hold with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is lightly scented, goes on thick &amp; takes a little work to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> After I added the Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp Oil, my hair got a little softer but the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clear Scalp a few times and I must say their product never disappoints.</li>
            <li> hair is long, to my waist.</li>
            <li> so your money goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, having long hair means you must protect and condition.  </li>
            <li> As soon as my hair is dry I have to put it in a pony tail because the static is crazy.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount, about 3/4s of what I use of other conditioners, and rinse out very well</li>
            <li> I only use it every other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with very long, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Cleared my dry scalp problems in three shampoos.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use straighteners too often in the summer months, but I do use a blow dryer often and am in the sun alot, so my hair can get dry at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to have a dry scalp in the summer, so  </li>
            <li> and now I have dandruff and dry spots on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp, and it seems that the shampoo&#x27;s that are advertised to help my scalp and hair, just don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I will repeat my main complaint against all the shampoos and conditions in this line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not my first choice for summer, because it is so conditioning and with summer humidity it makes my hair very limp and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> In general I use minimal product: perhaps a little mouses on the roots and a leave-in on the ends if im straightening, spray gel if not straightening, and, when I&#x27;m in the mood, some hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This could be because my hair is so long, but I do use other volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioners and can see the volumizing effects.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new conditioner, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Clear Scalp.</li>
            <li> In fact, she only sees me every 2 months to trim a little off the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s a bit more perfumed than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> conditioner is a hit with three out of four of my family members, with my son saying it leaves his very long hair feeling too slick but everyone else liking it enough to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, the fragrance is pleasantly mild and I&#x27;ve not experienced the usual itching and/or burning with a fragranced product.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be flat at the roots, so in lieu of teasing or heavy use of styling products, I like to use a volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner from time to time for fuller styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; conditioners have in the past been a HUGE fail.  </li>
            <li> I only had to use a small blob though I have shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of conditioner from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get any volume as I do with other volume brands.</li>
            <li> bottle came open during shipment and made a real mess- didn&#x27;t seal well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair feels like it has product in it and is limp instead of loose and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all, but it also did not give me any volume.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out.</li>
            <li> My typical shower routine is to shampoo, then wash my face, then apply conditioner comb it through and clip my hair up while I wash off.</li>
            <li> I see less hair in the drain after using this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> an added bonus the little tilt to the cap and</li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> Every time I used this product, my scalp was burning a little.</li>
            <li> Not just a little, A LOT.</li>
            <li> The substance felt a little watery in my hand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, few companies make unscented forms of their toiletries.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair greasy within a few hours after use.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I haven&#x27;t used conditioner on the roots of my hair at the scalp because I thought it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> The problem is the heavy feeling it leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li> is shiny and not weighed down by excessive product</li>
            <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t think that it would be any less offensive after breakfast!  </li>
            <li> only real negative, in my book, is the scent.</li>
            <li> Both bottles have a substantial flat base with opening end down to enable using those last few drops, and they are not going to be falling over with the slightest hit of water from the shower head.  </li>
            <li> and you use very little</li>
            <li> Usually when you get a product that promises to add volume</li>
            <li> Like a lot of guys my age, my hair has started to thin a bit in the front, so anything that will make that less noticeable gets my vote.</li>
            <li> But it leaves my hair with a dull look.  </li>
            <li> At least of the four products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained.</li>
            <li> I do not like the inch thick hair spray option.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wavy and thick and I use conditioner to reduce frizziness.</li>
            <li> you are used to a thick coverage with your shampoo/conditioner (i.e lather and creamy conditioner)</li>
            <li> It is difficult for my arthritic hands to hold the 12 oz bottle which has an odd shape.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, and this product does not weigh it down and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking forward to trying out this brand, but I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Winter is hard on my hair because it&#x27;s so cold and my hair tends to dry out badly.</li>
            <li> No.... I ordered the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I should use conditioner, but do so infrequently because it is difficult to rinse out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner with the matching shampoo and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not detangle as well, and the root boost is questionable.</li>
            <li> its impossible with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clear Scalp Volumizing Root Boost conditioner was horrible at detangling for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a great shampoo for the price. Cleaned my hair and my hair looked healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> Clear has become my go to shampoo and conditioner.  My hair naturally has no volume and a curling iron does nothing.  I do not like the inch thick hair spray option.  This stuff works!  It had volumized my hair and keeps it healthy too.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Works great. Cleared my dry scalp problems in three shampoos. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better volumizing conditioner. Why only 3 stars?  Good luck on getting it out of the container!  The hand strength needed to squeeze the container is just as incredibly bad as the product is good.</li>
            <li> I used this product several times along with the dry scalp shampoo by the same company and have had wonderful results.  Love the fragrance and the silkieness of the product without having to use a ton of it at one time.  My hair is short and color treated and with using both products I get a wonderfully soft texture to my hair with tons of volumne.  I always leave my conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes so as to soak up any extra umph that the product might be able to deliver on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good product that can do the job without breaking the bank then give this a try.  I think you just might be surprised.  I surely was.</li>
            <li> It does what a conditioner should for my hair, but the odor is too much to take in an empty stomach in the morning.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t think that it would be any less offensive after breakfast!  If you want to smell an old man&#x27;s overpowering after-shave, this is the product for you.  I won&#x27;t buy again until they make a light scent, or better yet, an unscented form.  I&#x27;d really would rather add the fragrance myself.  A light honeysuckle or rose would be pleasant.  Unfortunately, few companies make unscented forms of their toiletries.</li>
            <li> No.... I ordered the wrong product. I wanted the shampoo</li>
            <li> This whole line of hair care seems to be adequate but not exceptional.  At least of the four products I have tried.  They have a mix of conventional and healthy ingredients.  The conditioning is exceptional as far as getting rid of tangles.  But it leaves my hair with a dull look.  Interestingly enough, I notice that my hair dries quickly with this line of hair products, I don&#x27;t know what causes that.  But I do enjoy that aspect of it.  In short, I don&#x27;t feel compelled to buy more but I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seemed to work well and rinsed out without the sliminess that some conditioners have. It has the same nice clean smell that the rest of the Clear line has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight volumizing, but my hair is also about 8 inches below my shoulders, so is heavy to begin with, it might work better that way for shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt; I will repeat my main complaint against all the shampoos and conditions in this line. The bottle seeps a bit when it is left upside down in my shower and it is about 3 times more expensive than my regular less expensive conditioners that quite frankly do just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Hardly any scent (which is very good!) rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and sheeny after blow-drying.  I only had to use a small blob though I have shoulder length hair.  Makes it super easy to comb out tangles.  This conditioner worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and coditioners will always be something that works differently for different groups of people. For me, this version of Clear did not work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, to my waist. Not very thick, but pretty wavy. I don&#x27;t use straighteners too often in the summer months, but I do use a blow dryer often and am in the sun alot, so my hair can get dry at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A conditioner for me has to work well at detangling and moisturizing, but more emphasis on the detangling due to my hairstyles. Especially with my hair being so long, I need something that actually works, so that I am not using a whole bottle at a time. This is why I stick to salon brands since they are so concentrated. Every now and then I will switch to a drugstore brand, just to try something new though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Scalp Volumizing Root Boost conditioner was horrible at detangling for me. I don&#x27;t feel it was very good at conditioning at all in general. I had to use 3-4 heaping handfuls at a time and even then it just did not seem to be doing much. This Clear conditioner is very thick and rich, but it just didn&#x27;t perform well for me. My typical shower routine is to shampoo, then wash my face, then apply conditioner comb it through and clip my hair up while I wash off. I like to let the conditioner soak into my hair. With this, it was much more difficult to comb through my hair with the conditioner on and my hair still felt rough/ragged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner seems like it isn&#x27;t absorbed by the hair at all. It is like it just sits on top of it and then rinses right off. It does rinse easily with no apparent residue, so that is a plus. It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all, but it also did not give me any volume. This could be because my hair is so long, but I do use other volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioners and can see the volumizing effects. I tend to be flat at the roots, so in lieu of teasing or heavy use of styling products, I like to use a volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner from time to time for fuller styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to follow up with a leave in conditioner every day that I used this. My hair is not overly dry, so it shouldn&#x27;t have been such a big issue. I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck. This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly. It does smell good though, for what it&#x27;s worth. It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.ioner from time to time for fuller styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to follow up with a leave in conditioner every day that I used this.

            <li> We highly recommend this conditioner and given the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable! This product truly leaves hair silky, soft and it does seem to give EXTRA volume as promised! Usually when you get a product that promises to add volume it&#x27;s a gimmick, but this actually wasn&#x27;t. This produce has a great smell; it&#x27;s clean, light and seems to stay for a long time!</li>
            <li> Not only do I have VERY fine hair, but my hair is falling out because of a recent surgery. The Clear Scalp volumizing conditioner has helped add a great amount of volume to my hair. Not only does it add volume to my hair, but it smells great. I have had many complements on how good my hair looks and how good it smells.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t add volume, but it didn&#x27;t take it away either.  I have very fine hair, and some conditioners weigh it down.  I always have to look for volumizing conditioners to eliminate the problem.  This one worked well.  It has a pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t seem to linger after you have used it.  I like the creaminess of it, and it seems to coat my hair well.  When rinsing it out of my hair, it washes clean easily, and leaves my hair slick and easy to comb through when wet.  I don&#x27;t tend to have a dry scalp in the summer, so  I can&#x27;t speak for the claims of moisturizing my scalp.  I&#x27;m giving it a 4, because I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it, in that if something I have used before goes on sale, I would probably pick it over this.  However, I would buy this again, and it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> This looked like a woman&#x27;s product, so I gave it to the missus. Here&#x27;s what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of conditioner from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn&#x27;t think it fair to compare Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Daily Conditioner with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear conditioner is comparable with some of the conditioners mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, conditions my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]. Although I won&#x27;t say the quality of Clear conditioner is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear conditioner is great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle design. I don&#x27;t like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. Although I thought it&#x27;s a smart idea to place the dispenser at the bottom, I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it&#x27;s easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoos, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!</li>
            <li> This CLEAR \\&quot;SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner\\&quot; works well and has pleasant, but not overpowering, scent. The we use the conditioner in conjunction with CLEAR shampoo and it does add volume to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a hit with three out of four of my family members, with my son saying it leaves his very long hair feeling too slick but everyone else liking it enough to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly Recommended (you might have to try it to see if it is right for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and other conditioners I&#x27;ve used. It works fine, it smells fine. Tangles comb out nicely. It works as expected. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the way my hair looks. I should note that I do not have fine or limp hair. It&#x27;s wavy and thick and I use conditioner to reduce frizziness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count the number of conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried and then thrown in the trash in an effort to give my fine hair some needed volume.  This conditioner does do what it claims to do--volume without weight and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy it again. However, I wish it came in a more friendly container.  It is difficult for my arthritic hands to hold the 12 oz bottle which has an odd shape.  The L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure shampoo and conditioners are much, much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I like Clear conditioners. Winter is hard on my hair because it&#x27;s so cold and my hair tends to dry out badly. The ingredients in this conditioner, and the other Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried seem to really lock in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That very conditioned feeling might not suit everyone. I use a small amount, about 3/4s of what I use of other conditioners, and rinse out very well and it&#x27;s been working great for me. My daughter uses a bit more for her curls and finds they are a lot more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not my first choice for summer, because it is so conditioning and with summer humidity it makes my hair very limp and heavy feeling. For winter it&#x27;s ideal. This one seems more conditioning then some of the other Clear conditioners.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used this shampoo/conditioner combo i loved it. Made my hair feel silky and had a great smell. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now and I hate it. I&#x27;ve always let conditioner sit in my hair while I wash before rinsing it out but with this if I do that It won&#x27;t rinse all the way out and leaves my hair looking greasy. Figured no big deal, I just won&#x27;t let it sit in my hair. As soon as my hair is dry I have to put it in a pony tail because the static is crazy. The last couple days I&#x27;ve noticed that my heads been itching and now I have dandruff and dry spots on my scalp. I have really fine hair, but lots of it, that tends to get flat easy and Its always been shiny and beautiful and I don&#x27;t like to have to use a lot of product that can damage my hair. I rely on my shampoo and conditioner and my hair dryer and round brush to make it look good... its impossible with this shampoo and conditioner.My hair is also falling out like crazy and Im pregnant and its dull and much thinner than normal when it should look even better... Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for in a conditioner; it conditions my hair and leaves it shiny smooth and pretty. I have no complaints about this fine product!</li>
            <li> My hair needed some extra TLC after a summer of swimming in lakes and traveling and this product was amazing. I found that it brought life back to my hair and made my scalp healthy. This bottle went missing -- found it in my pre-teens bathroom , another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I should use conditioner, but do so infrequently because it is difficult to rinse out thoroughly. As a woman who now has to color treat her hair, hot water is the devil to my hair as it diminishes the color more quickly. This conditioner rinses out more quickly and like the dandruff shampoo leaves my fine curly hair with more volume. It is so effective that I am using conditioner more than once a week for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend Clear Scalp and Beauty. Their products work well and you use very little so your money goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also used the shampoo that goes with this conditioner, but not in tandem with the conditioner as I had used it up before I got this. Overall, I think this conditioner worked just fine on my hair. Nothing outstanding, but it performed on a par with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t notice a boost in volume after using it a while (and I have had fine hair all my life). The texture is creamy and the color milky white. It comes out of the bottle in neat ribbons. It goes on easily and rinses out just fine. I enjoyed the scent, and this conditioner definitely helps get a comb through my wet hair after the shower, which is really the main reason I use conditioner, as I&#x27;ve always kept my hair long. I love the fact that it contains vitamins and healthy natural ingredients. So yes, a good impression overall.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is lightly scented, goes on thick &amp; takes a little work to rinse out.  It claims to add all day volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to fine layered shoulder length hair &amp; find that this product (1) does not weigh my hair down, (2) makes my hair feel soft and bouncy all day, and (3) gives my hair a nice shine. Additionally, the scent lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my old stand-by (Suave professionals conditioner) does the same thing, so, in the end, my choice of conditioner would come down to price point since performance seems to be equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do like the bottle&#x27;s design (dispenser on the bottom), which allows you to get the conditioner out of the bottle without a lot of shaking.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very oily looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair greasy within a few hours after use. I do not recommend if you if have hair that is oily.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner with the shampoo, and they seem to make a good match. The conditioner is light and, while not as noticeably as the shampoo, does achieve good volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I only use it every other shampoo. Also, like the shampoo, it has a very strong perfume, which is another reason to use them together, as I think the fragrance would clash with other products.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner with the matching shampoo and was not impressed.  The combination left my hair looking oily or greasy- like I hadn&#x27;t washed it at all.  I was also hoping that it would be good for my scalp, but I didn&#x27;t notice that to be true either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came open during shipment and made a real mess- didn&#x27;t seal well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this produce did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really surprised me. I have thin hair plus I feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of it, so anything that weighs my hair down makes it look even more sparse. Because of that, I haven&#x27;t used conditioner on the roots of my hair at the scalp because I thought it was too heavy. I realized though that neglecting to moisturize and nourish the scalp wouldn&#x27;t help at all with my hair weakness, so I tried out this conditioner. Even slathering it on the roots and rinsing well, it feels incredible CLEAN and SOFT when my hair is dried. I&#x27;m really impressed with the feel of it, and hope that it&#x27;s actually doing its job to nourish the hair from the root.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team but I don&#x27;t get any volume as I do with other volume brands. I only use it on weekends to get a good clean. I won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling stronger and cleaner.  I see less hair in the drain after using this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos my closet is full of duds that didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have a dry scalp, and it seems that the shampoo&#x27;s that are advertised to help my scalp and hair, just don&#x27;t.  This has made my hair more manageable and is cheaper than any of the others.  I love it.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with very long, color treated hair.  However, since I only color my hair 2-3 times a year and I don&#x27;t use heat tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers; my stylist says my hair is in very good shape.  In fact, she only sees me every 2 months to trim a little off the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually alternate between Fekkai Glossing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Intense Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  However I was up for a change and thought I could swap the Clear Scalp line for the L&#x27;Oreal line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the new products had a much thinner consistency than my usual shampoo and conditioner.  The scent was also just okay, nothing remarkable.  After the first wash, I noticed my hair had more tangles and after a few more days I noticed that my ends felt dryer.  After I added the Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp Oil, my hair got a little softer but the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.  My husband, on the other hand, tried it and liked it but then again, he has much shorter and thereby younger hair than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;m glad he likes it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> hands down BEST smelling conditioner i have used in my life</li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;m a Joico (Kpak) girl, and I default to Herbal Essences or sometimes Pantene (both have long hair products) when I cant find Joico on sale (full price Joico is not in the student budget...though discounts are pretty easy to find).  In general I use minimal product: perhaps a little mouses on the roots and a leave-in on the ends if im straightening, spray gel if not straightening, and, when I&#x27;m in the mood, some hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is waist length and fine/thick.  I have a lot of strands---but the strand texture is fine.  So that added to the length means weight.  Which would make one want to TRY a volumizing conditioner. However, having long hair means you must protect and condition.  This product promised both: moisture and volume.  Worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.  \\&quot;Volumizing\\&quot; conditioners have in the past been a HUGE fail.  They leave me and my curls rockin&#x27; the white girl &#x27;fro.  With frizz and tangles!!!!  This was a lovely change: lightweight volume, No frizzled, and my hair straightened happily.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus the little tilt to the cap and side dispensing means you can easily dispense even the last of the product. (Huge points to the bottle design team!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the name of the shampoo needs changed.  It simply doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REASONS FOR LOSS OF ONE STAR:  did not leave my hair quite as shiny as I like.</li>
            <li> As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  Again, the fragrance is pleasantly mild and I&#x27;ve not experienced the usual itching and/or burning with a fragranced product.  Time will tell, but I think these two are going to meet the manufacturer&#x27;s claims.  Both bottles have a substantial flat base with opening end down to enable using those last few drops, and they are not going to be falling over with the slightest hit of water from the shower head.  These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several items in the CLEAR line and I think I&#x27;m done with them. The scent is ok, if cheap smelling. Some product lines make members of my household sneeze, but CLEAR was fine for all of them. The problem is the heavy feeling it leaves in your hair. Hair feels like it has product in it and is limp instead of loose and lightweight. This product is probably better for thicker or drier hair types. Mine tends to split easily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change after several weeks of product use.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner works just ok. My hair didn&#x27;t really get any more volume using this conditioner than with any other brand conditioner. My hair is very fine and limp. However, the hair gets nice and soft, just what a conditioner is supposed to do. Every time I used this product, my scalp was burning a little. I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to be like that, or if my skin reacted to an ingredient in this product. Overall, this product is just ok.</li>
            <li> Of all of the Clear conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I&#x27;ve liked the best. Like a lot of guys my age, my hair has started to thin a bit in the front, so anything that will make that less noticeable gets my vote. I&#x27;ve tried more than a few products, and most don&#x27;t do much of anything. Fortunately, the Root Boost not only conditions well, leaving my hair soft and manageable, but it also seems to actually \\&quot;volumize\\&quot; the roots and hair shaft, making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative, in my book, is the scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s a bit more perfumed than I&#x27;d like. The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case), so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises, and really does a great job on my hair. It&#x27;s definitely going to be a regular purchase from now on.</li>
            <li> no results with this product.. use the products you know work.. not because its a good buy or they promise you miracle results.</li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT. Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else. Went to the doctor and had all blood work done. Everything FINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene. Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out. Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained. They said this was unusual... I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck. If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clear Scalp a few times and I must say their product never disappoints. It smells great, comes out nicely, and leaves my hair with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This volumizing root boost conditioner worked great. My hair feels wonderful and even a little softer than it has before. Even after I&#x27;m done using this conditioner, I imagine I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new conditioner, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Clear Scalp. Their products are amazing and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick all shampoos guarantee they are the best thing for your hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth the money and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Hair is shiny and not weighed down by excessive product&lt;br /&gt;Hair visibly looks healthier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-If you are used to a thick coverage with your shampoo/conditioner (i.e lather and creamy conditioner) this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;-Small container size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is not a regular shampoo and conditioner so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use so you can see maximum results.</li>
            <li> This Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy is a very nice. I love the fragrance. It smells floral and reminiscent of my visits to the salon. The conditioner is on the thick side, but it&#x27;s easy to work it into my hair after shampooing. I particularly like the container. The opening is at the bottom, so the product will continue to move to the opening as it is used up. I&#x27;m sure you get to use the most conditioner possible out of the container and there is less waste than with other conditioners that have top spouts or openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is a Volumizing Root Boost. I have long, fine, straight hair and my roots were not noticeably boosted. Although I haven&#x27;t tried many, I have never found a root booster or volume product that does work on my hair. This is however, a very nice conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy and I have not found that it&#x27;s building up after daily use. If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Like the other \\&quot;CLEAR\\&quot; brand conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  I have very thin hair, and this product does not weigh it down and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> My wife has shoulder length hair and she said this product worked well.  It helps keep her hair conditioned without any greasy feeling.  She normally uses Dove but said if this were on sale she would purchase it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like both the shampoo and conditioner. I did notice some customers saying it took forever to wash out. I think they&#x27;re used to getting their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean but those shampoos dry the hair out. This makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is the very best conditioner I have ever used.  It is perfect for my fine thin hair.  It is not too heavy and not greasy, leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> Of all the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products I&#x27;ve used, Volumizing Root Boost is my least favorite. Like most of their products, the scent is medicinal, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for that with performance. My hair does not detangle as well, and the root boost is questionable. Most importantly, I did not get any unsolicited compliments like I did with the other conditioners. Volumizing Root Boost is average at best.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking forward to trying out this brand, but I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It smells nice and all, but I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;volumizing root boosting\\&quot; effects after using for at least a week. The substance felt a little watery in my hand.</li>
