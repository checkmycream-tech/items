            <li>So I was very pleased to find this 12-pack.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, and tastes great.</li>
            <li>It has the best scent (slightly sweet) and is the most moisturizing of all the varieties available.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing stuff EVER.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft and moisturized and smells wonderful as well.  </li>
            <li>I love the rejuvenating lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>My favorite chapstick.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm of all time.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves chapstick and this is her favorite brand and flavor.  </li>
            <li>and it is very soothing and tastes great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and my favorite flavor is the Acai Berry.</li>
            <li>It is the most soothing and long-lasting protection for my lips -</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most stores don&#x27;t carry it, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Giving this 4 stars because I love the one in pomegranate</li>
            <li>This will always be my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a great product (What else from Burts??!)</li>
            <li>I love this flavor and our family will enjoy Burt&#x27;s bees</li>
            <li>Scent is a bit strong but it does fade.</li>
            <li>I paid half what I would have paid at the store to buy 12, great deal!</li>
            <li>Very good, very sweet flavor, send a friend a few, are more like</li>
            <li>Production date is in 2014 and cheap price.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it here</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use chapstick on a daily basis so it is good to find something that does not deteriorate over time.</li>
            <li>I find it too sweet and have to remind myself not to lick it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best at &amp;#34;re-hydrating&amp;#34; dry lips and making them soft again.  </li>
            <li>At first, everything was fine.</li>
            <li>It has a mild fruity non-sweet fruit flavor and scent.</li>
            <li>Have used the Pomegranite, Honey, Mango, but the Acai Berry is our new favorite.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be the same as the burt&#x27;s bees beeswax lip balm, and got this because of the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>After trying all of the Yes and Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms, this is my clear favorite.</li>
            <li>This 12 pack was an absolute steal compared to buying 12 of these in any store, and when you factor in that many places seem to only carry certain Burt&#x27;s Bees products and rarely this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot;, it made it that much better.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm came as expected and great new condition.</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed, didn&#x27;t work any better than plain Chapstick and cost alot more!</li>
            <li>But it was too costly at local stores, so imagine how thrilled I was to find this product for such an outstanding price.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms--there&#x27;s at least one tube in every purse I own, and one of every variety in my desk drawer at the office and at home.     </li>
            <li>The 12 pack is a great deal - especially if you use the balm daily as we do.</li>
            <li>For most people, I think this would be adequate, but if you have really dry lips or are prone to having them, you should go for the burt&#x27;s bees beeswax version instead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even carried it around in a backpack to melt, and cooled it off in a stream with no ill effects.     </li>
            <li>After trying many different flavors, this is my #1.  </li>
            <li>The only place I have been able to get it, is Crackle Barrel.  </li>
            <li>I got a whole box to put in his Christmas stocking and set it up on Subscribe and Save!  </li>
            <li>It works best if you put the tip flat against your lips to warm slightly before applying; otherwise, it tends to break off a small piece.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than buying them one at a time, or even in the two packs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t really praise this product.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>compared to nivea it dries out fast, have to re apply.</li>
            <li>lips healed and thankfully, there was no serious damage done.</li>
            <li>at par with chapstick classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of acai berry but this is by far my favorite burts bees lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Moving from California to Washington we (family of four) constantly have chapped lips going from the cold outside to the hot inside - we&#x27;ve tried every lip balm imaginable to see what works the best and Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm - Acai berry  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it looked like a brand new, completely unused lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, I discovered this by accident--</li>
            <li>I used this while on accutane, which completely dries out your lips (you have to have lip balm on 24/7).</li>
            <li>Very affordable,very surprise.the price is very low.</li>
            <li>I picked this up from my local Whole Foods and used it on my lips for overnight hydration.</li>
            <li>Bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm as it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Previously I just used the \\&quot;original\\&quot; but when the Acai Berry Lip Balm came out, I changed my preferences fast!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than the standard burts bees and maybe wouldn&#x27;t last as long with each application, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much greasier and forms a thin oily-ish film on your lips, which quickly gets wiped away.</li>
            <li>But THIS little gem--THIS is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve ever encountered that doesn&#x27;t decompose when left in a hot car.      </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it all day long.  </li>
            <li> Constant dry lips.</li>
            <li> My lips are set for a long time!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even last half as long as the beeswax version.</li>
            <li> Does not create loose skin the way the brand Chapstick does.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s and my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees flavor, but is impossible to find at the stores.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm is slightly greasier in feel than the standard mint Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> The simple answer is perhaps, but if your someone who needs these constantly and often loses them or leaves them somewhere, this 12 pack is quite convenient.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I expected to find that it had done what all other lip balms have done--separated into lumps of components, become greasy and unusable.     </li>
            <li> Tried other brands and like Burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
            <li> We have used Burt&#x27;s Bees exclusively for a couple of years as my husband would break out in the corners of his mouth using other products.</li>
            <li> I felt a small tingle the next day, but thought nothing of it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the other lip balms that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes.</li>
            <li> Some other mint lip balms that I have tried have POISONOUS ingredients in them.  </li>
            <li> If your co-workers tend to give little gifts to each other for Christmas, this would work well for men and women.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other lip balm product!  </li>
            <li> All other balms, are not good enough moisturizers for me.</li>
            <li> One use takes me through half the day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t intend to leave my lip balm in the windshield well of my car to melt all morning, and it was just sheer luck that it got cold enough by the time I was heading home that night that it had resolidified.</li>
            <li> This flavor is not strong and is mellow.</li>
            <li> And I can even share a few with others.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting all summer with the \\&quot;meltability\\&quot; factor of 3 tubes of this blend--and they all melt in the sun, and solidify in as it cools off, without any negative impact to the balm AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burts Bees for at least 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> But these little guys are REALLY expensive if you buy them one at a time (</li>
            <li> It twirled up and down, and there were no visible lumps ANYWHERE in it!!!!!    </li>
            <li> Tired of the crap pharmaceutical companies put together.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the rejuvenating lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It has the best scent (slightly sweet) and is the most moisturizing of all the varieties available.  Try one before you commit to a 12 pack, but get it once you love this one!  This is much cheaper than buying them one at a time, or even in the two packs.  My lips are set for a long time!</li>
            <li> My favorite chapstick. Does not create loose skin the way the brand Chapstick does.</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Lip Balm, so thought I&#x27;d try it. I was very disapointed, didn&#x27;t work any better than plain Chapstick and cost alot more! I wll not buy this product again, alot cheaper at Walmart though.</li>
            <li> The scent has been changed after about 2months use. But it&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I used this while on accutane, which completely dries out your lips (you have to have lip balm on 24/7). I expected this to be the same as the burt&#x27;s bees beeswax lip balm, and got this because of the wonderful smell. However, this doesn&#x27;t contain beeswax and is completely different. It&#x27;s much greasier and forms a thin oily-ish film on your lips, which quickly gets wiped away. It doesn&#x27;t even last half as long as the beeswax version. For most people, I think this would be adequate, but if you have really dry lips or are prone to having them, you should go for the burt&#x27;s bees beeswax version instead.</li>
            <li> Very affordable,very surprise.the price is very low.</li>
            <li> It was excactly what I wanted! It works great! I was really happy I found this on amazon for a Christmas present!</li>
            <li> Constant dry lips. Tried other brands and like Burt&#x27;s bees. This flavor is not strong and is mellow. Works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm of all time. But it was too costly at local stores, so imagine how thrilled I was to find this product for such an outstanding price. I highly recommend this product. And I can even share a few with others.!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves chapstick and this is her favorite brand and flavor.  I started using it as well and it is very soothing and tastes great. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms--there&#x27;s at least one tube in every purse I own, and one of every variety in my desk drawer at the office and at home.     But THIS little gem--THIS is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve ever encountered that doesn&#x27;t decompose when left in a hot car.      Clearly, I discovered this by accident--I didn&#x27;t intend to leave my lip balm in the windshield well of my car to melt all morning, and it was just sheer luck that it got cold enough by the time I was heading home that night that it had resolidified. When I opened it, I expected to find that it had done what all other lip balms have done--separated into lumps of components, become greasy and unusable.     But it HADN&#x27;T. In fact, it looked like a brand new, completely unused lip balm.  It twirled up and down, and there were no visible lumps ANYWHERE in it!!!!!    I&#x27;ve been experimenting all summer with the \\&quot;meltability\\&quot; factor of 3 tubes of this blend--and they all melt in the sun, and solidify in as it cools off, without any negative impact to the balm AT ALL.  I&#x27;ve even carried it around in a backpack to melt, and cooled it off in a stream with no ill effects.     This is the most amazing stuff EVER.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is slightly greasier in feel than the standard mint Burt&#x27;s Bees.  But it is delicious nevertheless. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and my favorite flavor is the Acai Berry. But these little guys are REALLY expensive if you buy them one at a time (or even three at a time) from your local store. So I was very pleased to find this 12-pack. This should keep me supplied for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Very good, very sweet flavor, send a friend a few, are more like</li>
            <li> After trying all of the Yes and Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms, this is my clear favorite. It is the most soothing and long-lasting protection for my lips - I ride a Vespa every day so am exposed to lots of sun and wind. Unfortunately, most stores don&#x27;t carry it, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of acai berry but this is by far my favorite burts bees lip balm.  It&#x27;s the best at &amp;#34;re-hydrating&amp;#34; dry lips and making them soft again.  After trying many different flavors, this is my #1.  It&#x27;s softer than the standard burts bees and maybe wouldn&#x27;t last as long with each application, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  It makes my lips feel great!</li>
            <li> What more is there to say? This is the best Chapstick around. I use it and my husband uses it. We love it.</li>
            <li> This 12 pack was an absolute steal compared to buying 12 of these in any store, and when you factor in that many places seem to only carry certain Burt&#x27;s Bees products and rarely this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot;, it made it that much better.  And when your asking yourself \\&quot;Self, why would I ever need 12.  Won&#x27;t they expire before I use them all?\\&quot;  The simple answer is perhaps, but if your someone who needs these constantly and often loses them or leaves them somewhere, this 12 pack is quite convenient.</li>
            <li> We have used Burt&#x27;s Bees exclusively for a couple of years as my husband would break out in the corners of his mouth using other products. Have used the Pomegranite, Honey, Mango, but the Acai Berry is our new favorite.</li>
            <li> Production date is in 2014 and cheap price. I love this flavor and our family will enjoy Burt&#x27;s bees Lip Barms during the upcoming winter.</li>
            <li> Moving from California to Washington we (family of four) constantly have chapped lips going from the cold outside to the hot inside - we&#x27;ve tried every lip balm imaginable to see what works the best and Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm - Acai berry  smells great, feels good on your lips, and lasts longer than just about all the others we&#x27;ve tried. We all love it! The 12 pack is a great deal - especially if you use the balm daily as we do. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> The lip balm came as expected and great new condition. Everyone loved them in their stockings Thank you for the great deal!</li>
            <li> I like it but the acai berry sent is a bit over powering.</li>
            <li> I adore Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially their lip balms. I picked this up from my local Whole Foods and used it on my lips for overnight hydration. At first, everything was fine. I felt a small tingle the next day, but thought nothing of it. After only three days of usage, I needed to throw this into the trash because it was actually causing the skin to peel off of my lips. Applying it caused a burning sensation and my lips were flaking, though not bleeding yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips healed and thankfully, there was no serious damage done. However, I can&#x27;t really praise this product. I prefer the other lip balms that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes.</li>
            <li> I like this product!  All natural ingredients!  Some other mint lip balms that I have tried have POISONOUS ingredients in them.  This one does not! Works great!  Yum!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s and my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees flavor, but is impossible to find at the stores.  The only place I have been able to get it, is Crackle Barrel.  I was so excited to find it here and the price is great!  I got a whole box to put in his Christmas stocking and set it up on Subscribe and Save!  It is very moisturizing.  It is not tinted.  It has a mild fruity non-sweet fruit flavor and scent.</li>
            <li> Bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm as it is all natural ingredients. Tired of the crap pharmaceutical companies put together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use chapstick on a daily basis so it is good to find something that does not deteriorate over time. It works best if you put the tip flat against your lips to warm slightly before applying; otherwise, it tends to break off a small piece. I find it too sweet and have to remind myself not to lick it off. After a while the sweetness seems to wear off. I gave one to each family member and they all like it. If your co-workers tend to give little gifts to each other for Christmas, this would work well for men and women.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other lip balm product!  This is wonderful and it smells great when I put it on.  I don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it all day long.  One use takes me through half the day.</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit strong but it does fade. Giving this 4 stars because I love the one in pomegranate</li>
            <li> Great price on package of 12. Now I have one for every month for the next year!  Goes on smooth, and tastes great.</li>
            <li> compared to nivea it dries out fast, have to re apply. at par with chapstick classic. people who have used nivea might not like it.</li>
            <li> Good seller good item!!</li>
            <li> Initially, I was looking for the Mango one as IMO it feels like the best moisturizing product for my lips but the acai berry will always be my second choice. All other balms, are not good enough moisturizers for me.</li>
            <li> Staple in my bag. Love it!</li>
            <li> This will always be my favorite lip balm.  This flavor and only this flavor!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm!  Keeps my lips soft and moisturized and smells wonderful as well.  I paid half what I would have paid at the store to buy 12, great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burts Bees for at least 20 yrs. Previously I just used the \\&quot;original\\&quot; but when the Acai Berry Lip Balm came out, I changed my preferences fast!! Not only is it a great product (What else from Burts??!) it tastes GREAT!! I stock up whenever I can and have gotten my husband to use it as well! Well done Burts!! I also recommend it to everyone I work with!</li>
            <li> Very good! Good quality! Good price! I love it!</li>
