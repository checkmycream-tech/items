            <li>As with all hair products, you will experience a buildup of product and I recommend using a clarifying shampoo 1x week to keep your hair in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>I love most of your products, but this one made my hair so sticky; my brush tangled every strand</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the volume this product gives my hair</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body, more shine, and the curls stay even through sleeping on them.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this spray adds volume without any sticky crunchy &amp;#34;coated with product&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>This product works better than Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 3 yrs now and love the way it separates my hair</li>
            <li>Always buy this stuff, makes my fine hair feel like there&#x27;s more and increases volume.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with other hair products and on its own; both have given me great results.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine hair some lift.</li>
            <li>Gives noticeable volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have 2a/2b fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Very fresh.</li>
            <li>super easy management and control (no tangled or gunky hair to snag your fingers, combs, or accessories</li>
            <li>You will have beautiful large curls that are soft and your hair will be full.  </li>
            <li>It looks great on her long hair though!</li>
            <li>hair feels squeaky clean</li>
            <li>For the greatest benefit spray directly at the root area, for me itâ€™s the crown and back of my hair where I need a lift.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how everyone else has such good luck with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaper and works great, so the other company lost my business.  </li>
            <li>The very first day I used this and went to work</li>
            <li>Adds good hold for fine hair without weighing down hair</li>
            <li>Its not terrible strong or offensive, but it definitely has a scent.</li>
            <li>For years I have used a different product which I loved, but it was expensive, however it worked great!!  </li>
            <li>I did get some on my face and right where I got</li>
            <li>I got compliments about how full &amp; pretty my hair looked :) I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this product as part of my daily hair regiment &amp; will re-order when I run out for sure.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making life easier for me!</li>
            <li>I have used Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s root boost plus,spray gels, powders, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>a difference is because they did not know what to look for and because it feels so light and natural.</li>
            <li>I have used it and like it and will be ordering more since I shampoo my hair daily.  </li>
            <li>This product is similar to mousse but better.</li>
            <li>The scent is a pretty grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>It always gives my hair a nice boost after I&#x27;ve shampooed it and works well with other products I use.</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews, but not every product will work for every body of hair.  </li>
            <li>I can easily get 2 months of daily use out of it</li>
            <li>Works great...been using it for a few years and love the volume it gives my hair!</li>
            <li>This works really well for me on my thinning, permed for body hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference when using the product.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to look on Amazon and found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It gives me some volume without having to use sticky hairspray, and this product smells really</li>
            <li>you spray it over your whole head , through the ends of your hair, it really does volumize...</li>
            <li>Thanks Bed Head</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>It really works to plump up my roots</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>ever haha.</li>
            <li>It holds styles really well.</li>
            <li>Now, if you desire a very large hair style then you will need to add a thickening powder such as Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s powder play to give your hair a &#x27;grit&#x27; that helps you &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; upon.</li>
            <li>and they are all pretty good, the only thing is that my hair still feels heavy</li>
            <li>Have used much better products including other tigi products.</li>
            <li>It really enhances hair texture and helps hairstyles hold better, without weighting my hair down.  </li>
            <li>This spray mousse works great especially if you gently hold your wet hair in the palm of your hand and blow dry on gentle.  </li>
            <li>Wish it added more volume instead of weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning somewhat as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure not to spray too much because it becomes a sticky mess!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this method instead of just spraying at your roots</li>
            <li>Does not really do much for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried this spray on a few clients and I love the texture it gives everyone.</li>
            <li>this product normally does.</li>
            <li>When it dries, its VERY hard to fully remove it, so it seems like after just a few uses, product dries over the nozzle and doesn&#x27;t give the perfectly even mist that you&#x27;d liek to achieve with this product.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, long, straight, limp hair....</li>
            <li>I had used this in Utah, where I no longer live, and didn&#x27;t want to run around looking for it in the state I now live.</li>
            <li>I find if I pull it through to the ends of my hair, it becomes weighted down (my hair is fine</li>
            <li>Endorsed by the big haired Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;m a natural blonde with baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Kenra, Big Sexy Hair, Redken&#x27;s thickening lines, and Tigi&#x27;s other volumizing products for alternatives.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is not a mousse, gel or wax; but similar to aerosol hairspray.  </li>
            <li>My hair is big for the first time</li>
            <li>i have short hair and this really lifts the roots!</li>
            <li>so it came out all gloppy and had to smooth it down with my hand</li>
            <li>Be careful, one spray will be a significant hold and much more than 2 sprays and you will have a hard time getting a brush through it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something that gave me volume without leaving my hair a strange texture, and this really did help.</li>
            <li>on)&lt;br /&gt;4) smells strong like grapefruit until dried and then virtually no scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of using mousse, which can make my hair too sticky and hard to put a brush through my hair when I&#x27;m blowing it dry, this product smells really good and is easier to style.</li>
            <li>and I REALLY don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;gunky-ness&amp;#34; of left over residues.</li>
            <li>it smelled old and did not have the fragrance for which I bought it.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my roots and not on the rest of my hair and it works very well there.</li>
            <li>but you can run brush thru it and your hair is soft again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a guessing game anyway.</li>
            <li>First of all, I usually HATE the way most hair products smell, but this one smells like Sweet Tarts!  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in how flat my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does absolutely nothing for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>So over at least the last eight years, I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product seems to clog within the first few uses.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser used this  because I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thin hair.  </li>

            <li> Endorsed by the big haired Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;m a natural blonde with baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Kenra, Big Sexy Hair, Redken&#x27;s thickening lines, and Tigi&#x27;s other volumizing products for alternatives.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is not a mousse, gel or wax; but similar to aerosol hairspray.  </li>
            <li> My hair is big for the first time</li>
            <li> i have short hair and this really lifts the roots!</li>
            <li> so it came out all gloppy and had to smooth it down with my hand</li>
            <li> Be careful, one spray will be a significant hold and much more than 2 sprays and you will have a hard time getting a brush through it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something that gave me volume without leaving my hair a strange texture, and this really did help.</li>
            <li> on)&lt;br /&gt;4) smells strong like grapefruit until dried and then virtually no scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of using mousse, which can make my hair too sticky and hard to put a brush through my hair when I&#x27;m blowing it dry, this product smells really good and is easier to style.</li>
            <li> and I REALLY don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;gunky-ness&amp;#34; of left over residues.</li>
            <li> it smelled old and did not have the fragrance for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my roots and not on the rest of my hair and it works very well there.</li>
            <li> but you can run brush thru it and your hair is soft again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of a guessing game anyway.</li>
            <li> First of all, I usually HATE the way most hair products smell, but this one smells like Sweet Tarts!  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in how flat my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does absolutely nothing for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> So over at least the last eight years, I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> Not cheap but worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product seems to clog within the first few uses.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this  because I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It used to be the only way I could ever get my hair &#x27;big&#x27; or at least not so darn flat, is with a whole train of items each using a lot of product!</li>
            <li> this can will last a long time with daily use (lasts me 2+ months</li>
            <li> Finally, this product lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Most products weigh my hair down and just coat it with something slick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the Bed Head Hard Head Hard Head Spray, too,  and my hair looks styled without looking like a helmet.  </li>
            <li> only thing I found is that when you use this, you need to blow dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sprayed it and let my hair air dry, and it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, very little body to your hair, this is a great product or at least it is for me.  </li>
            <li> in other words, flat flat flat.</li>
            <li> However, I am one of those people who don&#x27;t care how it feels as long as I/</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time  Would buy again</li>
            <li> I completely broke-out for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Because of this, the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After using the thickening spray, the other products actually work for me now!  YAY!</li>
            <li> less than an hour later it&#x27;s beyond flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time after my stylist suggested it.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER once your hair is dry the smell is nonexistent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking dry or frizzy, it just adds tons of volume.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry, though</li>
            <li> It really does make my thin, blonde hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and thin, I spray this in when it&#x27;s wet and then blow dry it</li>
            <li> Remember not to scrunch; just loosely hold hair while the dryer is aiming at your air in your hand.</li>
            <li> You must use this product on wet, combed-through hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on my roots while hairs still wet.</li>
            <li> , so won&#x27;t interfere with any other fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li> So-I&#x27;ll start with the only real negative and explain that the bottle lasts a long time, so there is a lot of opportunity for product to dry around the nozzle.</li>
            <li> This spray gives hair a little grip and allows it to be styled without slipping through a brush or comb.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for people like me with thin and limp hair.  </li>
            <li> , (I run my fingers through to distribute), flip your head upside down and blowdry.</li>
            <li> Also hold your head down.</li>
            <li> Seems to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I just spray it in damp hair at the roots before I blow dry....flip my head upside down &amp; blow dry that way, then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> If gives you idy with out cating the hair or making dry and dull.</li>
            <li> A little teasing never hurt anyone either!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While this does add texture to my hair, it also leaves it feeling a little sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The few days when I haven&#x27;t used it...</li>
            <li> I like this how ever this product is heavy feeling....</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this product and</li>
            <li> but these products were all too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you are going on a vacation, or out of town and have limited space take this, kenra 25, and a comb (for teasing)</li>
            <li> This was not secured properly and I opened the box to find the plastic cap off and the spray nozzle broken off; the product is unusable, can&#x27;t be sprayed with a broken nozzle and apparently the product can&#x27;t be returned so I basically flushed $13 down the toilet.  Not happy!  </li>
            <li> This is a product that is difficult to find at salons anymore and even though you may hear that other products are similar, they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the reason other negative reviewers didn&#x27;t &#x27;notice&#x27;</li>
            <li> It makes the hair a bit stiff, but still stays comb-able.</li>
            <li> when arrived, though, it was wrapped in plastic tape leaving a sticky residue on the bottle :\</li>
            <li> and it was tough to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I will say one negative to this product, if you are like me and cannot stand the smell of grapefruit then sadly, this is that product.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to others and will order for my sister who has extremely thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> after years of expensive products, trials and tribulations, I finally have an ALWAYS go-to product for my hair that doesn&#x27;t feel awful and works like a miracle!!</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it has been shelved or exposed to questionable conditions, but my husband said it smelled musky when I sprayed it, not floral and yummy like</li>
            <li> But with that thickness, unfortunately, comes a bit of frizz.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this was a loser for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> It must be me :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my scalp itch and dries out the hair</li>
            <li> Adds good hold for fine hair without weighing down hair</li>
            <li> Works great...been using it for a few years and love the volume it gives my hair! Easy to order from this site..great service!</li>
            <li> Love this root boosting thickening spray! My favorite!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this! This was not secured properly and I opened the box to find the plastic cap off and the spray nozzle broken off; the product is unusable, can&#x27;t be sprayed with a broken nozzle and apparently the product can&#x27;t be returned so I basically flushed $13 down the toilet.  Not happy!  Lesson learned. Don&#x27;t order products of this nature from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order.  The product helps me style my hair as it helps it look fuller.</li>
            <li> I had used this in Utah, where I no longer live, and didn&#x27;t want to run around looking for it in the state I now live. Nice to know that I find almost anything I need or just want on Amazon.com. Thanks for making life easier for me!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I have heard mixed reviews and because everyone&#x27;s hair is different it&#x27;s kind of a guessing game anyway. I have baby fine hair, but I have a lot of it. My problem is that I can make my hair 80&#x27;s rock band big (overkill so when it falls it&#x27;s where I want it) and less than an hour later it&#x27;s beyond flat. It used to be the only way I could ever get my hair &#x27;big&#x27; or at least not so darn flat, is with a whole train of items each using a lot of product! I have used Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s root boost plus,spray gels, powders, lotions, etc. and they are all pretty good, the only thing is that my hair still feels heavy and I REALLY don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;gunky-ness&amp;#34; of left over residues. However, I am one of those people who don&#x27;t care how it feels as long as I/my hair looks good. Until now...after years of expensive products, trials and tribulations, I finally have an ALWAYS go-to product for my hair that doesn&#x27;t feel awful and works like a miracle!! Seriously, if you are going on a vacation, or out of town and have limited space take this, kenra 25, and a comb (for teasing) and you are set! You must use this product on wet, combed-through hair. Spray at the roots and all over if you desire, (I run my fingers through to distribute), flip your head upside down and blowdry. The way this works is by separating the hair and creating a &amp;#34;weightless&amp;#34; effect. Perhaps the reason other negative reviewers didn&#x27;t &#x27;notice&#x27; a difference is because they did not know what to look for and because it feels so light and natural. Now, if you desire a very large hair style then you will need to add a thickening powder such as Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s powder play to give your hair a &#x27;grit&#x27; that helps you &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; upon. I will say one negative to this product, if you are like me and cannot stand the smell of grapefruit then sadly, this is that product. HOWEVER once your hair is dry the smell is nonexistent. Hence the reason I can still give it 5 stars. Finally, this product lasts me a long time. I can easily get 2 months of daily use out of it and I apply it liberally every time.&lt;br /&gt;Recap:&lt;br /&gt;1) weightless feel and lift&lt;br /&gt;2) no gritty, gunky, residues- hair feels squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;3) super easy management and control (no tangled or gunky hair to snag your fingers, combs, or accessories on)&lt;br /&gt;4) smells strong like grapefruit until dried and then virtually no scent&lt;br /&gt;5) this can will last a long time with daily use (lasts me 2+ months and I dose generously)&lt;br /&gt;Remember, everyone&#x27;s hair is different. If you try this and it isn&#x27;t what your looking for don&#x27;t give up. I recommend Kenra, Big Sexy Hair, Redken&#x27;s thickening lines, and Tigi&#x27;s other volumizing products for alternatives. Goodluck!!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair some lift. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> so far, so good. Have tried this spray on a few clients and I love the texture it gives everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this Queen for a day product by Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after I get my hair towel dryed. Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;or does not leave flakes.  Will be buying more&lt;br /&gt;of this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good service</li>
            <li> After my hairdresser used TIGI Queen for a day on my hair I immediately bought a bottle from her.  First of all, it is not a mousse, gel or wax; but similar to aerosol hairspray.  It smells yummy and is not sticky or flaky after application.  For the greatest benefit spray directly at the root area, for me itâ€™s the crown and back of my hair where I need a lift.  I find if I pull it through to the ends of my hair, it becomes weighted down (my hair is fine and I have a lot of it).  You will also need to blow-dry as this is what locks in the volume and thickening agents.  A little teasing never hurt anyone either!&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with other hair products and on its own; both have given me great results.  If you are using for a root thickening spray only, this bottle should last you quite some time.  As with all hair products, you will experience a buildup of product and I recommend using a clarifying shampoo 1x week to keep your hair in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> Did I get a faulty product or something?  This stuff does absolutely nothing for my fine, thin hair.  It&#x27;s almost like I am just spraying water on my roots.  No lift, hold or thickening at all.  I don&#x27;t understand how everyone else has such good luck with this stuff.  It must be me :(</li>
            <li> This spray mousse works great especially if you gently hold your wet hair in the palm of your hand and blow dry on gentle.  You will have beautiful large curls that are soft and your hair will be full.  Remember not to scrunch; just loosely hold hair while the dryer is aiming at your air in your hand. Also hold your head down.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, long, straight, limp hair....so I just love this product! I got it about a month ago &amp; have been using it just about every day since.  The few days when I haven&#x27;t used it...I can really tell a difference in how flat my hair looks.  I just spray it in damp hair at the roots before I blow dry....flip my head upside down &amp; blow dry that way, then style as usual.  The very first day I used this and went to work I got compliments about how full &amp; pretty my hair looked :) I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this product as part of my daily hair regiment &amp; will re-order when I run out for sure.</li>
            <li> This product arrived and I used it on my hair the next day...it smelled old and did not have the fragrance for which I bought it. I am unsure if it has been shelved or exposed to questionable conditions, but my husband said it smelled musky when I sprayed it, not floral and yummy like this product normally does. I will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> Have used much better products including other tigi products.</li>
            <li> will buy again!! love this product!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and holds your hair well at the roots. Just be sure not to spray too much because it becomes a sticky mess!</li>
            <li> This works really well for me on my thinning, permed for body hair. It also seems to help my hair set last longer. It makes the hair a bit stiff, but still stays comb-able.</li>
            <li> DELISH!!! Smells wonderful!! Not sticky or greasy. I like it, would order again.</li>
            <li> I read some great reviews on this product so I decided to try it. I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference when using the product.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this  because I have thin fine hair and I decided to buy some from her. Not cheap but worth the price.It does what it says it will do. Then I decided to look on Amazon and found it much cheaper. Loving my Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> Always buy this stuff, makes my fine hair feel like there&#x27;s more and increases volume. It&#x27;s not sticky. I put it on my roots while hairs still wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and thin, I spray this in when it&#x27;s wet and then blow dry it and it feels great! It gives me some volume without having to use sticky hairspray, and this product smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I found is that when you use this, you need to blow dry your hair.  I&#x27;ve sprayed it and let my hair air dry, and it wasn&#x27;t the same. Probably some type of heat activated ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this spray. It really does make my thin, blonde hair appear thicker. But with that thickness, unfortunately, comes a bit of frizz.  It&#x27;s a conundrum. But it is summer, so I&#x27;ll save my judgement for winter. Maybe it&#x27;s the humidity affecting the frizz. But it does do what it says. My hair does look thicker!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I love most of your products, but this one made my hair so sticky; my brush tangled every strand and it was tough to comb through.  I read all the positive reviews, but not every product will work for every body of hair.  Sadly, this was a loser for me.</li>
            <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  it&#x27;s good for my hair and does add dimension.  i will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> Helps make hair fuller. Smells great. I like that it is a spray. Lasts a long time  Would buy again</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t get 5 starts because of the spray nozzle. So-I&#x27;ll start with the only real negative and explain that the bottle lasts a long time, so there is a lot of opportunity for product to dry around the nozzle. When it dries, its VERY hard to fully remove it, so it seems like after just a few uses, product dries over the nozzle and doesn&#x27;t give the perfectly even mist that you&#x27;d liek to achieve with this product. I recommend wiping it with warm water after use and make sure you replace the cap each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight formula-great for fine hair, doensn&#x27;t weight it down&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt get sticky&lt;br /&gt;If you spray it over your whole head , through the ends of your hair, it really does volumize...I highly recommend this method instead of just spraying at your roots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is difficult to describe. Its not terrible strong or offensive, but it definitely has a scent.</li>
            <li> I love the volume this product gives my hair</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it advertises. It is activated with heat. I put it in my hair prior to using the curling iron. It gives my hair more body, more shine, and the curls stay even through sleeping on them. I was very impressed to find an item that really did what it claimed it would do. Truly a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> Even though it didn&#x27;t work right the sellers are awesome</li>
            <li> I had never used this hairspray and when I did it was like a spray bottle of hairspray instead of a mist so it came out all gloppy and had to smooth it down with my hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time after my stylist suggested it.  I initially bought it from the salon for double what I paid here on Amazon.  This product is awesome for fine or thining hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking dry or frizzy, it just adds tons of volume.  Thanks Bed Head</li>
            <li> Fast service. Great price.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> I really wanted something that gave me volume without leaving my hair a strange texture, and this really did help.</li>
            <li> For years I have used a different product which I loved, but it was expensive, however it worked great!!  When I went to order some of that spray, I was told that the company will only sell it if you purchase the entire package which includes items I do not use.  I started searching and came upon this product.  I have used it and like it and will be ordering more since I shampoo my hair daily.  It is cheaper and works great, so the other company lost my business.  I will recommend this to others and will order for my sister who has extremely thin hair.</li>
            <li> While this does add texture to my hair, it also leaves it feeling a little sticky and heavy. Wish it added more volume instead of weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair the boost and body it needs.  This is a product that is difficult to find at salons anymore and even though you may hear that other products are similar, they aren&#x27;t.  Smells like citrus.  Aaaah.</li>
            <li> First of all, I usually HATE the way most hair products smell, but this one smells like Sweet Tarts!  It doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry, though, so won&#x27;t interfere with any other fragrance you are wearing.  It really works to plump up my roots and I haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking, which can occur with some root volumizers/thickening sprays.  I only use it on my roots and not on the rest of my hair and it works very well there. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This has been a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for me for several years.  It always gives my hair a nice boost after I&#x27;ve shampooed it and works well with other products I use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have thin hair. So over at least the last eight years, I have tried so many products. This is the only product I continue buying. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Put it at the root when you get out of the shower and style!</li>
            <li> Endorsed by the big haired Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;m a natural blonde with baby fine hair.  It really works.  My hair is big for the first time ever haha. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have medium length, very fine hair... in other words, flat flat flat. I absolutely love how this spray adds volume without any sticky crunchy &amp;#34;coated with product&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Im so happy that my hair stylist turned me on to this. i have short hair and this really lifts the roots! love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Gives noticeable volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for people like me with thin and limp hair.  Have been using it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray I have ever used, and I have used a lot of sprays!  It really enhances hair texture and helps hairstyles hold better, without weighting my hair down.  I love the Bed Head Hard Head Hard Head Spray, too,  and my hair looks styled without looking like a helmet.  I have used these products with both very short and medium length hair.  They should package this spray with a &amp;#34;King for a Day&amp;#34; label, too!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, but it didn&#x27;t do a lot for my short hair. It looks great on her long hair though!</li>
            <li> If you have thin, very little body to your hair, this is a great product or at least it is for me.  Great price on amazon, plus you don&#x27;t have to search for it.</li>
            <li> Does not really do much for my baby fine hair. Will not be re-ordering. Seems to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like this product because you can spray it at the roots rather than work it all through you hair.  I have short, fine, thin hair.  This does give my hair some volume for styling.  (I still need to spray hairspray to keep my style \\&quot;set\\&quot;.)  This is pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is similar to mousse but better. Instead of using mousse, which can make my hair too sticky and hard to put a brush through my hair when I&#x27;m blowing it dry, this product smells really good and is easier to style.</li>
            <li> This product seems to clog within the first few uses. Don&#x27;t seem to have an issue when purchased at a retail store. Amazon will not allow returns on this product. Beware!</li>
            <li> I like this how ever this product is heavy feeling....but it gave me body. It appears to be just like hairspray. I did get some on my face and right where I got I completely broke-out for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thin, fine hair. Most products weigh my hair down and just coat it with something slick or heavy. This spray gives hair a little grip and allows it to be styled without slipping through a brush or comb. It holds styles really well. Be careful, one spray will be a significant hold and much more than 2 sprays and you will have a hard time getting a brush through it. Because of this, the product lasts a long time. The scent is a pretty grapefruit scent. Very fresh. This product works better than Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme.</li>
            <li> I love TIGI Bed Head products and this one is just as FAB as the others I have! Works well, smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky feeling - give me good volume - Perfect!</li>
            <li> Been using this for 10 yrs. if. Have fine hair this is the product for you! If gives you idy with out cating the hair or making dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I have 2a/2b fine curly hair. I spray this all over - it gives me volume and curl definition - I will buy again and I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is a dream!  My hair is thinning somewhat as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  A few sprays of this product and the volume is pumped UP!  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several different products to add texture and definition. but these products were all too heavy for my hair.  After using the thickening spray, the other products actually work for me now!  YAY!</li>
            <li> Love the product!  when arrived, though, it was wrapped in plastic tape leaving a sticky residue on the bottle :\</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 yrs now and love the way it separates my hair but you can run brush thru it and your hair is soft again. It smells wonderful, almost fruity but better.  It also keeps my hair from drying.</li>
